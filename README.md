This is officical repository for the work [Multi-Agent Sampling: Scaling Inference Compute for Data Synthesis with Tree Search-Based Agentic Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17061). We study how to synthesize data for alignment from multiple distinct language models such as Llama3, Qwen2, Mistral, etc, which is so called problem of multi-agent sampling. We propose [TOA]() (Tree Search-based Orchestrated Agents) to achieve this goal. Our method is driven by Monte Carlo Tree Search with a Reward Model integrated.
