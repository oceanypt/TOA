Provide well-reasoned arguments and examples to support your assessment. Consider the implications of this methodology for different age groups and educational levels. Additionally, discuss the balance between the emphasis on proper language mechanics and the potential limitations on creativity in language expression. Ensure that your response reflects a deep understanding of the structural view of language and its implications for English language teaching.\nIn a critical analysis, compare and contrast the Direct Method and the Grammar-Translation Method. Identify and discuss the key principles that differentiate these two language teaching methods. Additionally, evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching techniques associated with each method. Support your analysis with examples and consider the implications of these methods on language acquisition and proficiency.\nIn light of the historical context and critiques discussed in the Audio Lingual Method, evaluate critically the reasons behind the decline in popularity of the Audio-lingual Method. Provide specific examples of criticisms and discuss how the method's theoretical foundations contributed to its diminished use in language teaching. \nConsidering the evolution of language teaching methods discussed in the course of Communicative Language Teaching (CLT), analyze critically the central concept of \"communicative competence\" in CLT. Discuss how CLT addresses the limitations of previous methods and evaluate the role of learners and teachers in the CLT approach.
