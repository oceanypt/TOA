The July issue is traditionally sold during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: to read the pages when the soul yearns for Chabrol.
However, we will talk about the MIFF next time (for now, I will just complain that this year, the organizers' understanding of the inexplicable idea that the happy owners of purchased tickets are much more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world is guilty of, has finally taken root in their minds), and in this issue, we will report on what we saw in Cannes and at the "Kinotavr".
The cover of the July issue is decorated with another pleasant face - the main character of the film "Predators", produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine try not to miss the story about "The Beginning" by Christopher Nolan (a man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman..."), the most - without idiots - anticipated film of the summer.
In addition, this time we are publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and it is clear that the author of "Suspicion" and "Rope" is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Glazerov, Anna Golovnaya, Nick de Semlin, Dan Jolling, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karayev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinnova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergei Mезенov, Sergei Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexei Prostakov, Seraphima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Mura Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Aleksandr Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina, and Evelin Salt, the London-based editor-in-chief, despite an impressive list of achievements, were suspected of espionage in favor of the Russians and decided to catch them at all costs.
Driven into a corner, she will change her usual black color and go herself to search for the truth.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal bad girl promises to strengthen the actress's position in the action genre even more.
She will cause one accident after another, run around the walls like in "The Matrix" and throw strong men in identical strict suits around like children.
This is how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, the native, who blew up and repaired the world with "The Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and impeccable embodiment of Evil.
And at the same time, all together it turned out not to be a tedious blockbuster of the American type about saving humanity, but a lovely living carnival.
What Beson did for 13 years between Element... and Adèle... I don't want to remember.
He, to put it mildly, was not idle, but all this script-producer fuss and rare, forced directorial performances will be forgotten.
But “Adele...” — hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems that the 13-year-old before us was not our Besson, but some kind of doppelganger.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drank wine in a cafe across the street and wrote a story about the most charming adventurer.
Retelling the plot (albeit in general terms), whipping up expectations, is more sinful than usual in this case.
Here, the whole incredible drive lies in the fact that surprises are waiting for you after every turn or reply.
And all of them are pleasant.
Either a girl, or a vision
Adel's unusual attachments
The most exciting adventure film of the decade hints that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle Blanc-Sec" will start like "Amélie", head towards "Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi's comics about journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin before Adèle starred in only three films.
The actress became famous for her role in "The Girl from Monaco", for which she was nominated for a Cesar Award.
The director does not run after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging them to appreciate the special effects, sets or stunts, but captivates them, like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the edge of the world: ‘Come on, my reader, great things await us!’
At the same time, Besson treats genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has watched old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating banalities, not denying oneself in cynicism and not being shy about taking risks
Director: Luc Besson
IN ROLES: Louise Bourguignon, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Beigbeder, Gilles Lellouche
SYNOPSIS: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city was thrown into turmoil by the ancient monster that the old medium had brought back to life.
The police are chasing after the fossilized beast, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the natural history museum and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has a case not so much with the beast itself, as with the medium – she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl is dragging a real mummy from Egypt.
Released on July 22
«Adele...» — this is the case when a parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre and is capable of radically changing it, directing it along a new path.
This was the case with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino's gangster films, with the aforementioned "Indiana Jones" (they paid tribute to it and made fun of it), and finally, with "The Fifth Element."
Besson's style in this film is made up of verbal trickery, actor's clowning and narrative equilibristics (circus terms are quite appropriate - the union of two arts here is organic and strong as never before).
A few words should be said about Adele herself.
It embodied an undeservedly forgotten type of adventuress, who takes not so much from the exploitation of sexuality, as from the purest courage and valour.
In the movies, guys like this are usually paired with some hapless macho or lovable loser
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer, who only twirls under his feet (his knowledge of zoology is only useful).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on love trifles, but has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Luke Besson, trained in numerous genre "cats" and, it seemed, completely sour, showed an unexpected creative mischief, reminding that the boundary between the preferences of bored visitors of mega-malls and erudite regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for cheerful eccentrics.
Playing adventure cinema without sadness, fear and reproach
Room of Death
A hermetic horror with a claim to psychologism and a political context. In 2002, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror was panned by critics, but it was liked by the public and earned well at the box office, and most importantly, it caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
That's how the young director ended up at the factory, churning out new horrors according to old patterns: Bay set himself the goal of re-shooting the entire horror classics in the form of remakes, and commissioned Liebesman to make the prequel to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
Critics grimaced again, but the public liked it again - Leibesman worked in the spirit of the "new scary ones", emphasizing the excessive physiology of violence.
In general, his example can be used to observe how an entire genre writhes in convulsions, trying to invent new ways of influencing an overstimulated audience: the naturalistic gore of splatter films merges with the chase scenes of slasher films.
The plot is reminiscent of the "Saw" franchise, but without liters of blood.
Among the prototypes is the debut film by Vincenzo Natali, Cube. The film is no longer made by Michael Bay.
So in "Death Room" Libesman was forced to take a different path: instead of a mindless slaughter or a monotonous chase from a maniac, he preferred a smarter option - almost without the notorious bloodshed, but with psychological games and riddles.
The evil doctors here are playing cat and mouse with the test subjects.
And three men in a locked room try to work out a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from the outside?
Or try to break out of your cage at any cost?
The test is not only for them, but also for a young ambitious employee of the intelligence agency, who is tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who is well-versed in wild experiments.
SCENARIO: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and given a stack of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the test subjects in the head.
A game of survival begins, closely watched by government agents behind a one-way mirror.
Too contemplative for horror, but not enough for outright arthouse
He can conduct a secular conversation, and drive a fire extinguisher by the muzzle, but he is not able to miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is cautious and unyielding in her sympathies.
She is offended by her father's courtly way of life and openly spies on him, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls, as he dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young suitor from a poor family with money.
But the main topic of the family conflict is not the difference in generations or the choice of profession, which, one way or another, has already been predetermined, but the unsuccessful attempts of the girl to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
The sluggish melodramatic Mher Mkrtchyan, together with Pavel Bardin, made a comedy with Ivan Urgant, "Three and a Snowflake".
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of a growing daughter in a comedy genre
The fragmented plot meanders around the love adventures of the characters, who are always talking about psychology, but themselves, apparently, due to the witty directorial discovery, emphasize the language of the glance and gesture.
The secondary storylines (the girl who was injured in a car accident and whom Alexei wants to marry, the alcoholic athlete played by Sergei Gorobchenko) are, alas, only sketched in.
It is especially a pity about the line about the business of buying up football players, and what was left out.
SYNOPSIS: The fate of his underage daughter, Nastya, is of utmost concern to the soccer star sales agent.
The good-natured father himself changes wives like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must certainly marry a guy with “backbone”.
What a disappointment for the businessman when Nastya, in the struggle for independence and in defiance of her father, chooses her peer and business partner.
But with a potential slogan for the film's audience, the author hit the bull's-eye: "Don't look for the problem where it doesn't exist."
Their similarity simply cannot fail to amaze.
In both films, there are squads of tough guys, lucky soldiers, who are forced to take revenge on those who betrayed them, and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
The heroes race through practically the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - in both places something stuffed with dollar bills explodes, and a whirlwind of bills descends on the set.
Even the villains, dressed in expensive costumes, are not easy to distinguish from each other (they are played in both cases by Patricks - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to film dance battles - "Dance Brothers".
Chris Evans was recently invited to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a series of comics that came out in the 70s and was rebooted in the 2000s, Joe Cornish - a comedy series of the 80s.
It's just amazing how they, without colluding, brought different materials to an absolutely identical thundering denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action movies that evoke a lot of pictures with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you have to choose between the two films, then Losers looks a little bit more sympathetic and is clearly more successful in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times less).
At least there's Zoe Saldana, who looks great in a beret
STARRING: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
SYNOPSIS: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of experienced commandos working for the CIA were betrayed by their own superiors: the helicopter with the children they were trying to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves were considered dead from that moment on.
But they are alive - and intend to take revenge on the scoundrel with the deep voice who orchestrated the whole thing.
All of this is cute, but honestly, spending an hour and a half of your life on a White picture is only worth it if you have absolutely no other options.

A simple story about a Romanian fugitive convict
A Romanian low-budget film that won an award at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, with only these data in hand, it is possible to vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the picture, and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, the film promises to be topical.
Of course, it will be realistic, and tough at that.
There is a high probability of involvement of non-professional actors.
There will also be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian poverty, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, not knowing the year of release, you can easily accept what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the countries of the Warsaw Pact, who were lectured on Bresson in the early 80s
The film received the Grand Prix of the Jury at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The screenplay is based on a play by Andrea Vălean, whose work is in high demand among directors of the Romanian “new wave”.
Operator Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All of the above is true for the debut work of Florin Serban, and - understand us correctly - is not at all pejorative, but rather recommendatory: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development when its representatives have faith in the methods of
his work has not yet been shaken.
And this moment must be caught: it is only thanks to this faith that one can endure the one and a half hour spectacle of the Romanian juvenile colony and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pistoreanu (whose story, despite the chasm separating the two cultures, one can easily
convert into an exploit like the 70s, with a cowboy who decided to take a walk from the jail, where he was about to be released, to the nearest saloon).
IN ROLES: George Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
SYNOPSIS: After serving his four years, 18-year-old convict Silvio (Pistoreanu) is about to be released, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this point on, the behavior of the young man becomes inadequate.
The intrigue with the social worker Anna further spurs the guy to desperate actions, the meaning of which is exhausted by the name of the picture.
What a load of rubbish!
If you want to watch, watch.
Not a bad debut, inspiring a faint hope that the Romanian art house will someday grow into a decent genre
A cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-author Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all the "Ice Age" films, "Horton" and "Robots."
“The Ugly Duckling” is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to watch it in 3D), especially if you like it when different objects from time to time try to jump out of the screen into the hall), coherently written, and, most importantly, there is not a single fart joke here, because of which in “Ice Age” you had to shyly squeeze into the chair and cover the children’s eyes with your hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not a sense of proportion on the part of the authors, but the blatant asexuality of the main character, which in turn was dictated by the unwillingness to touch on the topic of pedophilia in any way.
For the "adult" part here, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, a rather harsh black humor is responsible (which, one would like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
Overall, it's a very likable movie - so much so that, at times, it feels almost too perfect and right.
You can feel the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who thought through every little detail so that the film would appeal to all categories of citizens.
Not that we wanted to see how the heroes of a children's cartoon are eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic explosion
SYNOPSIS: The snouty villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of space travel have grown up with him, plots to steal the moon from the sky in order to execute his plan for world domination, aided by his minions, including his teenage cohort, Margo, his unpredictable younger sister, Edith, and his dim-witted and loyal dog, Max.
In a certain advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans – Margo in glasses, Edith in a hat, and Agnes, who is as cute as a kitten from Shrek.
As is usually the case, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is modeled after Christopher Meloni - both of them are bald, snub-nosed and prone to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
In the final, Gru dances Travolta's part
A truck pulls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a hypothetical desert, and out of it come three pairs of the finest breasts.
That's right.
The carriers of this gift themselves are not so essential.
The camera confidently fixes attention on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately have good news - the whole film is in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things about women's beauty and the casting was such that what is happening on the screen is of secondary importance.
And a lot of fun things happen.
"Brokers," "killers," and "stripteasers" dig in the sand, get splashed with water (don't ask why), carry some kind of gruel, and periodically fight like wildcats.
The creators believe that a pregnant sow with generous forms, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and shining white teeth is cool.
"Kinky things" are primarily aimed at classic sexploitation films.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of Zena: Warrior Princess and Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.
A film with a similar spirit in Moscow cinemas is "A Stem for Jennifer".
It's also cool when a bitchy beauty whips eggs at a thug, a beaten-up punk fights in a pair with a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword and lesbian sex are added to this; and the intrigue unfolds through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, a film fetishist will find a real Klondike of pleasures here.
It's clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang were having the time of their lives making this trash parody, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it were not for the physical data of the actresses, it would have become boring already by the middle.
It can be assumed that this game came to us from the adult night channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes up serial episodes)
STARRING: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
SYNOPSIS: Three dangerous beauties bring a mafia boss to the desert, who has diamonds worth a tidy sum hidden somewhere here.
Having achieved nothing and having shot the unfortunate bandit, the babushkas start to squabble, fight with each other and with the periodically arriving scoundrels, as well as kissing and hugging each other regularly.
Along the way, it turns out that all three are not who they appeared to be at the beginning.
Apparently, in the opinion of the author, it is even funnier.
A product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous misogyny
Yes, with his latest film, "Doomsday," the grumpy "Mad Max" for the impoverished, Marshall has taken a serious misstep
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum returns the director's shaken trust.
The new politically incorrect and gloomy magnum opus does not shy away from a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration, and a fierce B-movie aesthetic.
There is in the picture and the hooligan spirit of "Dog-warriors", and the beastly cruelty of "Descent".
The "Marshall Plan" for cleaning up the "peplum" from the post-gladiatorial film trash, in general, worked.
In 2011, Kevin McDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (among others, the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough guys trying to reconcile their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
Homicide and the piquant details of the fulfillment of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and thoroughness.
The scene of the annihilation of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the opening sequence in the German forests from the now classic "Gladiator" by Sir Ridley Scott, but one absolutely does not want to accuse Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without complaints.
STARRING: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Domhnall Gleeson, Liam Cunningham, David Thewlis
SCENE: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
A remote outpost manned by Centurion Quintus Dias (Fassbender) is brutally overrun by a Pict raiding party.
Miraculously saved Diaz is forced first to join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a bunch of other surviving Romans, to try to escape from a group of Pict warriors led by the sadist Etain (Kurilenko).
The subtle art-house actor has so far managed to win back only bit-part character roles in Hollywood, but it is very much to be hoped that the situation will change after Centurion.
Peplum — an edition corrected and supplemented.
Almost like "Gladiator", only more modest and harsher
The continuation of the story about the schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationship with two extremely promising young people - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf-cultured Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A large-scale film version of a cartoon series about a bald boy-wizard, who is called to bring peace to four kingdoms.
The ruler of fire started a bloody war and subdued his neighbors.
Young Aang will be able to stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
Leonard Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is able to steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
Penetrating the object's sleep, it forces the sleeping brain to work according to its own rules.
But this time he will have to do the opposite – leave in one head what was not there.

The second series of the fluffy family comedy.
A group of hardened criminals, led by the seemingly fragile Royce (Adrien Brody), mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where they are hunted by a group of stylish, fanged aliens.
The return of the cult character of the 80s to the big screen.
Note George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-turned-filmmaker Anton Corbijn (Control) for a curiously existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hit man hiding from people in a small Italian town and belatedly coming to grips with human nature.
"The visionary artist on the scale of Corbijn and the magnificent George Clooney - this is a cinematic union concluded in heaven," boasts the studio press release.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of Clooney's longest love affair in life - with Italy: filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Taking Martin Bout's novel "A Very Hidden Gentleman" as a basis, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the English narrator was replaced by an American in the title, and the protagonist, who used to be an illegal arms dealer, turned into a simple killer.
For the rest, the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack tries to sort out his last job and finally give up his lucrative profession, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tecla Ruten), in whom the character of Clooney falls in love instantly.
"Jack tempts fate," says the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may not be who she claims to be.”
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's ashy hair (the film looks like a long clip 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the main role in the film adaptation of Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front"
Or maybe I can shoot you with a rifle!?
Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at the same time this season.
First, in Venice, on the set of the thriller "Tourist" by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck ("The Lives of Others").
There he plays a heroin-addicted lover of Angelina Jolie's character.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico, at the "Rum Diary" venue, an adaptation of the legendary Hunter S. Thompson's debut novel.
The director and screenwriter of the project is Bruce Robinson (“Withnail and I”), whose last directorial work was the thriller “Jennifer 8” in 1992.
Looking at the work of the plakatists of domestic prison drama, one can even not doubt what inspired them.
But you can't approach the issue of implementing the idea literally!
However, at least it is good that the heroine of the Russian film, even though she is a stranger, is not completely bald.
Director Dennis Dugan mostly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They are already responsible for four joint projects: Gilmore Girls, The Big Bang Theory, Chuck and Larry: The Wedding, and Don't Mess with Zohan!
The fifth comedy, "Classmates," will be released in July, and the sixth, "The Hypocrite Wife," starring Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman, is currently in production.
The schedule also includes the seventh film - the romantic comedy "Jack and Jill", where Sandler will have to play Jack and his twin sister Jill at the same time.
Matthew Vaughn, who was remembered by the audience this year with the fabulous action movie Kick-Ass, will handle the reboot of the X-Men.
In the film "X-Men: First Class" the director first called James McAvoy, giving him the role of a young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the telepathic mutant Emma Frost nicknamed the White Queen, Amber Heard will transform into the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender will presumably become Magneto.
While shooting of a new series of Bondiana is postponed, its new director Sam Mendes has no time to be bored.
The list of his works includes the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the screen adaptation of Isaac McQueen's novel "On the Shore".
The author adapts the script himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of practical Major George Smiley - the main character of the series of novels by John Le Carre - in the screen adaptation of the thriller "The Spy Who Came in from the Cold".
In the first adaptation of this work in 1979, Alec Guinness played.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film "Let Me In".
Tom Tykwer is adapting the fantasy bestseller Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell.
According to the director's admission, it is not easy (there are six parallel storylines in the novel), but it is an extremely interesting job.
He has already received offers from Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
Filming of the international action movie by Maksim Korostyshevsky is taking place in Crimea under the working title "Soldiers of Luck".
It is dedicated to millionaires who went to a real war in search of adrenaline for their money.
Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korolyshevskaya and others star in the film.
The premiere of the film is scheduled for the beginning of 2011.
Sam Rockwell will play in the comedy "Baby Jesus" together with the English pop star Pixie Lott
Megan Fox fired from Transformers 3
As the Ragottipe film company assures, the dismissal "is not connected with that interview, in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler".
Nevertheless, the place of the main heroine and the new beloved of the hero Shai LaBeouf will most likely be taken by the English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
The girl has no experience in the cinema, so she will have an accelerated course in acting.
This fact should not scare the sophisticated viewer - there are many examples in the history of cinema of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron (Monster), Angelina Jolie (In the Land of Blood and Honey), Jessica Lang (Blue Sky, Tutsi), Kim Basinger (L.A. Confidential), Jennifer Connelly (Requiem for a Dream), Gina Davis (The Accidental Tourist) and Halle Berry (Monster's Ball) started out as models or worked for fashion magazines, and eventually received a well-deserved Oscar.
Succeeded in acting (also the beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, especially nice, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
High awards are clearly within their reach.
In a word, Rose has someone to take an example from.
Valeriya Gai Germankaya, who received a Special Mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for her film All Will Die and I Shall Remain, and who directed the scandalous TV series School, has been appointed creative director at the MT TV channel.
The management of the channel believes that Valery will be able to bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, it is already planned to shoot its own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Also Germanka began casting new hosts.
The comedy "Kolotilov" by director Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "Tricks".
The main theme of the film remained the same — a provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) rushes to Moscow to his fiancée, but gets delayed to train a football team of street kids.
The second storyline of the picture received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plisnaya, the role of the capital's bride Nadya will be performed by Milla Iovovich.
As an additional intrigue, a third one will appear — Nadya’s former fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the courtyard team will win the football championship, the dilemma arises of who will get Mila Jovovich.
Due to the constant postponement of the filming of "The Hobbit" and the presence of a lot of side projects, Guillermo del Toro refused the position of director.
The studios are trying to persuade producer Peter Jackson to take the matter entirely into his own hands, but he is ready to agree to this step only if there is an urgent need.
David Yates, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose film District 9, produced by Jackson, was nominated for an Oscar, are mentioned as possible successors.
The official name of the new director will be announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Overwhelmed by the rigid schedule, critics and filmmakers raced at supersonic speeds between the Sochi Winter Theatre, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Zhemchuzhina Hotel, where press conferences and round tables were held in a continuous stream, barely having time to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films behaved in the same way - practically in every film someone ran somewhere: confused Asians from Yusup Razyakov's "Gastarbeiter" and Dmitry Mamulia's "Another Sky" searched for a missing grandson and wife, a fugitive gangster from Yuri Bykov's "Live"
The same cops were happily waving their fingers at the hero of Klim Shipenko's detective story "Who Am I?" — which, however, was remembered by the public more for the presence in the frame of the totally naked Jeanne Friske.
There were heroes of the domestic show business and a couple more contest pictures - in the film "Elephant" Sergey Shnurov played a long-distance truck driver carrying a circus animal to be slaughtered, and Evgeny Grishkovetsky mused on his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the two-person film "Satisfaction", where business partners challenged each other to a drinking duel over a lady.
However, business events at the "Kinotavr" also had a tangible imprint of the show - there was no boredom at any of them.
At a round table devoted to the fate of Russian art-house cinema, the chairman of the Russian Film Support Foundation, Sergei Tolstikov, engaged in a verbal spat with critics: "Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?" he growled at those present.
"I write them," the president of ERVEZS! Andrei Plakhov responded in confusion.
The scandals did not end there: closer to the end of the festival, a film by Aleksei Fedorchenko, Ovsyanki, was suddenly removed from the competition program – it will go to Venice: the selection committee of Mostra decided that an additional Russian screening would be a hindrance to them.
Previously, "Kinotavr" did not interfere with the giants - Sochi has repeatedly shown films from major festivals: this time, let's say, Sergei Loznitsa's film My Happy Life was in the competition, which in the spring competed with Mikhalkov and Virasakun for the Côte d'Azur.
Nikita Sergeyevich at the "Kinotavr" visited the film of the former Cannes competitor and said that he liked it.
Chairman of the jury Karen Shakhnazarov, on the contrary, did not like Loznitsa's film at all - but under the pressure of his colleagues he was forced to give her the prize for directing.
The award for the best debut - "Missing" - was received by the daughter
A terrifying cinematic encyclopaedia of Russian life: naive, humane and rational heroes are beaten, robbed and provoked into committing monstrous acts for no apparent reason.
A precisely delivered, cleansing thought experiment, made by a misanthrope with a mathematical education, who calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls the films quotes from Mamaradshvili, avoids any events in the script and claims that the joy of the viewer is in the work of understanding his little accessible meditative films.
The most difficult Kinotavr film has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition — the directorial star was born.
Perfectly dressed and groomed programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the burrow of neat bachelor life.
But a cast-iron babushka falls on the house, and an unfair hand of the punitive authorities falls on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
“Sometimes it is useful to work not only with debutants”, the producer Sabina Yeremeyeva triumphantly declared from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull an "inner debutant" out of the veteran of domestic art-cinema.
And this is symptomatic - nowadays in our cinema, bison are moving with the youth.
And not at all the other way around.
Documentary film, shot in such a way that it makes your head spin more than a similar art film.
The author is interested in a screwdriver investigating an electric meter, and a piece of unsalted butter drifting on a cast-iron frying pan, — all this turns the story of an unemployed miner, his rare-eyed lover and her criminal brother into a real oil painting.
The winner of the short film competition, Nikolai Sokolov, applies the black-and-white style of the French New Wave to the world of residential areas.
Let the Yaroslavl assembly passages in the story about two schoolboys, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other of playing Bach backwards, seem strange, but thank you for the rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality.
«Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten planes of the An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24 type, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means of influencing clouds during the work, and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide (“dry ice”), meteorological fuse with iodine silver and powdered reagents - rise into the sky.
The process looks like this: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) “break up” the clouds coming towards the city with these reagents. The particles of the substances condense moisture around themselves.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned, and precisely in the place where the impact on the cloud occurred.”
For the past ten years, work has been underway on a remake of the science fiction film, in which Michael York played the leading role.
Recently, the director was appointed Carl Rinsch (he already has a remake of The Creature from the Black Lagoon on his schedule), famous for his commercials.
Earlier, the names of Bryan Singer (X-Men), James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) were associated with the project.
According to the plot, the hero, who turned thirty years old, is forced to flee from the death sentence, since the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to the 80s rotoscopic fantasy cartoon and plans to turn it into a large-scale movie.
The original was the result of a joint creative effort by director Ralph Bakshi (The Lord of the Rings, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a large number of drawn cucumbers.
In it, the warrior Larn saves Princess Tigra and the entire people from the evil ruler of ice Necron.
Rodriguez promises to pay close attention to the creation of non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the time being, as he himself is planning to work on a remake of Dario Argento's classic giallo film.
The heroes will be brought back to the big screen by none other than Michael Bay - the master of action, explosions and horror remakes.
The director of the remake will be Damin Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Argento and Romero already collaborated on "Dawn of the Dead" and together shot "Two Evil Eyes" in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio will produce the film and write the screenplay.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy "Arthur"
"I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the situation in China," Chen says.
— Chinese women in our time run big businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gong Li embodies that strength."
For the second time in a row, you play an imaginary character.
Is it a coincidence?
A regularity.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I am presenting two films here (at the KINOTAVR film festival and the Sochi film market - EMHRF).
And in both I play a woman-dream.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he presented me, and many people probably think that's how I am in real life.
Dream girl.
Your partner in the film, Aleksandr Yatsenko, is nothing like his character.
How did you find a common language? What is he like on the pitch?
He is absolutely not what he seems at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought, "Yeah... not just me."
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, we would not have succeeded in anything.
And this contact happened literally a few minutes after we met.
We are great friends, I am not afraid to use this word.
I told him about all my fears, about all my anxieties, about what I was afraid of, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he was happy to give me that advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
And so, at the premiere, we watched the whole film holding hands.
How did the filming in Sevastopol go?
Sevastopol is the city where I came for the first time.
I have never performed there, nor have I ever vacationed there, nor did I go there as a child.
This city has a special magic, its own character, its own charisma.
And this is a city that you want to come back to.
He has his own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and there is always time for everything.
It turns out that it was not difficult for you to play the part of being in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on the screen, which many, frankly speaking, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you to play?
You know, I am an amateur actor.
And I am, by nature, a very trusting person.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I, in fact, entrust myself to his hands and I want to be the test from which they will mold.
I understand very well that it is more visible from the side, and I, again, ask for tips and talk to the director, for a very long time, not me talking to him, but he talks to me, and he has preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, with long, many-hour rehearsals, we arrive at the organic quality you’re talking about.
And how did you work with the director of the picture Klim Shipenko?
I was turned on by everyone, the cameraman, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I love working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep, not to eat - and here was exactly such a situation.
Do not sleep, do not eat for days - and still, even if thunder, even if hail.
And if something did not work out, it was a disaster, and you need to do something urgently in order to make it work.
In this atmosphere of madness, it is very easy to work.
And it seems to me that when people are so far gone into the painful fanaticism of what they're doing, it can't not work out, because too much energy is being expended.
What scenarios do you refuse?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will work with?
I don't want nonsense, stupid dialogues, films that say nothing, films that don't carry anything.
I don't want to work just to appear on the screen once again.
Do you have any proposals, projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are currently no specific proposals or plans.
I am not the kind of person who draws up schedules.
The script came, it interested me, today this premiere happened.

While we are working on the November issue, there are practically continuous film festivals in Moscow: American cinema - AmFest, 2togo, 2t-1 will start soon, followed by a festival of British cinema.
And here's what's interesting: half of my acquaintances are constantly discussing that someone needs to be boycotted, and someone needs to be supported, for some - well, excuse me - very vague reasons.
At the same time, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed by the terrifying Chu4 project without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
I don't want to complain about this, but if you, having bought a ticket with money, stay in the hall to watch the giant pixels and horizontal figures of the actors, then they will show them to you.
But in the meantime, we have no pixels: "Tron: Legacy" (a continuation of the classic film about virtual reality), "Let Me In. Saga" (an American remake of a beautiful Swedish film), "Unstoppable" (another approach by Tony Scott to the topic of trains) and a wildly detailed story about how the films about Conan, the barbarian, destroyer, and governor were created.

The multi-part fairy tale about the nice wizard with glasses is coming to an end.
And even if fans of the series have long since read the book and know how it will all end, and those for whom the word "Expelliarmus" means nothing will stay at home, the title of the main November blockbuster for Harry is practically reserved.
The studios, by the way, are not made up of fools: in order to stretch out the audience's enjoyment and squeeze the maximum out of the franchise, they decided to split the seventh film into two parts.
So a sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwarts will stretch until next summer.
Social network
The history of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, first and foremost, a story about a paradox.
The film tells about the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the whole world, estranged five friends and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire of the last decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the lead role is as great as our conflicted genius, emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg is launching the site for a variety of reasons: partly out of frustration with the world, partly out of a sports interest, and partly just because it's "cool."
The very idea and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events suggests a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of "The Social Network" become apparent from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara): the ringing, tough dialogues of the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gain strength here and do not soften until the very end.
The same goes for Fincher's directing: relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss twins, who were played by actors who didn't look alike.
The face of one of them, with the help of computer graphics, was superimposed on another.
Natalie Portman studied at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Runee Mara got the lead role in Fincher's next film, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."
Director David Fincher
STARRING: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Ruffalo, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Josh Pence
SYNOPSIS: The gloomy and introverted Harvard student, Mark Zuckerberg, having turned a corner in his personal life, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, relationships with a few close friends begin to fray and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its role: warm, sometimes sunny, even in the dark it remains cozy, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate lawsuits.
Outside the stream of endless discussions in the film, not much happens: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles hardly warrant even an additional paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorokin and 48-year-old Fincher to this story, which is not very rich in details?
After watching, there is a persistent feeling that "The Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and the incompleteness in this case is an important artistic device.
Just about twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing roughly the same thing, only on a larger scale, with space egos and big deals.
Now, when the daily purchasing power has become even higher, the policy is no longer carried out at board meetings or in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, he dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are tapping their feet: who said that rich, beautiful, and athletic people can't also be smart?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, a black comedy could well come out of The Social Network.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more in his case - positive or negative?
And what social consequences will his invention entail?
Is he a crook?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if there is the slightest hint of something like that.
But here it is not even necessary: in their version of history it is not important at all.
"What's it like to feel beautiful?" asks the song by Tre VerdeNez, "Vabu Wotse A Vspm Map," that precedes the credits.
The hero does not know.
The film suggests the answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of the lost online generation, which has a weak idea of beauty and even less of feelings.
Tastefully made character drama about the high-profile court case of the internet age
In the early 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames did not really start to appear among people of humble origins.
They got by with the name "such-and-such, such-and-such son".
That is, patronymics - nicknames based on the father's name - were in use.
But sometimes, for example in the case of the father's remarriage, the matronym - a nickname based on the mother's name - was used.
Susannah is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susannah".
Serfs of small landowners really for a long time did without surnames - why would they need it, when you have 20 souls and everyone is always in sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Thus, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already at the beginning of the 18th century all had surnames.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep the peasants on the land, but let them go to the obrok - let them earn a craft and pay the master.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, in which it was necessary to inscribe the family name.
Of the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released for tribute.
This means that they already had surnames.
Crime investigators from the capital arrived to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Criminal investigators from the central office and employees of the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation into the gas explosion in the house at Lineynaya Street, 39, reports NGS.
According to the investigation, the accused, Irina Urbach and Evgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization Interregional Gas, inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked carelessly, and, on the contrary, overpriced their services, the agency reports with reference to an informed source.
The day before the tragedy on the Line, a man and a woman visited three apartments in house number 39, where they changed the hoses of the stoves.
So, in one of the apartments, they put a hose for water instead of a gas one.
However, Kavun denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, there was a leak and explosion of a gas-air mixture in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, resulting in the deaths of 13 people.
Earlier, the suspects in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk were arrested.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg, it was possible to avoid a storm surge flood
Arguments of the Week.

Experts were able to prevent flooding by closing the dam a day earlier.
On Friday in St. Petersburg, the threat of flooding increased dramatically due to bad weather in the city.
The sea surge flood was prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could have been the 32nd, reports the St. Petersburg publication Neva.Tudey.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the shutters in the Gulf of Finland, the water held at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which at times reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been opened again, the water level has dropped, and ships can sail through the Gulf of Finland again.
It should be noted that ten meteorological stations are monitoring the water level situation on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This makes it possible to prevent flooding that may follow the strengthening of the wind.
In Turkey, 8 people were arrested in the case of defects in the collapsed buildings
In the Turkish province of Şanlıurfa, 8 people were arrested in connection with the construction defects discovered in the buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake.
Armenpress reports that Habertürk reported this.
As a result of the earthquake registered in Turkey on February 6, more than 20 thousand people died.
The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 was followed by hundreds of aftershocks, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of Iran and the President of the country
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Sayyed Ali Khamenei, and the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenpress was informed about this by the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
The message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reads:
"Your Eminence,
I sincerely congratulate you on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenian-Iranian warm and friendly relations with centuries-old roots, rich history and traditions are of special importance for our two countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing a steady and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendly relations, tempered in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will have even greater achievements in the future for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran.
I take this opportunity to wish you good health and many years of life".
In the congratulatory message sent to Ebrahim Raisi, in particular, it says: "Your Excellency, please accept my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Founded on centuries-old history and mutual respect, the unbreakable Armenian-Iranian relations are of special importance to the Republic of Armenia.
I am confident that as a result of our joint efforts, we will be able to take interstate cooperation to a new level, with a multisectoral agenda that will be expanded even further for the benefit of the welfare of our two friendly peoples and the security of our countries.
Emphasizing the importance of our perceptions regarding the establishment and strengthening of regional peace and stability, I confirm the official invitation addressed to you during my visit to Tehran last year to visit Armenia.
I would like to take this opportunity to wish you new achievements, and the friendly people of Iran stable peace."

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, a World War II aerial bomb exploded on Friday, which sappers were trying to defuse.
A powerful explosion was heard dozens of kilometers away, but there were no casualties.
Police in Norfolk County announced that, although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military personnel involved in defusing the bomb were injured.
"The device detonated shortly after work began to neutralize it.
Fortunately, the entire crew is safe.
Authorities have begun assessing the damage," Norfolk police assistant chief Nick Davison told reporters.
Locals write on social networks that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

Caption to the photo: The explosion happened despite the plans of the sappers, but there were no dead or wounded
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the bank of the River Yar, at the mouth of which, on the North Sea coast, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective sand wall around it, and a cordon, which did not allow outsiders, was set up at a distance of 200 meters.
At first, on Thursday, the explosive experts were going to use a robot to cut off the detonator from the bomb, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, as the local press writes, to use the "slow burning" technique for the explosives.
In the process of this burning, an explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, known as "Blitz", 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, said Alesia Solovei, a research associate at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences.
The share of women among candidates of science and doctors of science is also growing: women account for 41.1% among candidates of science and 21% among doctors of science.
In all areas of science, with the exception of technical, the share of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is medical sciences, in which the share of women is 64.4%.
Only in technical sciences are men predominant, women make up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the share of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is more than in the republic as a whole, by 10.2%.
Women account for 46% of candidates of sciences and 20% of doctors of sciences.
Among the faculty at institutions of higher education, more than half are women (57%).
Among the pro-rectors for scientific, educational and educational work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
There are the most women among senior lecturers and lecturers - more than 60%.
The proportion of women among associate professors in the departments is high (55.2%).
According to a Republican public opinion survey conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) do not agree with the gender stereotype that "science is a male domain".
More than half of the country's residents do not hold the opinion that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"The transformation in the mass consciousness of gender representations about the research competence of women contributes to the attraction of young women to science, the development of their creative potential, the formation of a successful role model for a woman scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the mentorship institution," noted Alesia Solovei.
February 11 is celebrated annually as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The holiday was established to introduce women and girls to the field of science, to encourage women to pursue scientific careers, and to recognize the achievements of women in science.
According to UNESCO data, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world. -0-
The likelihood of raising the key rate in the future is higher than its reduction
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina following the results of the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have occurred recently.
On the one hand, the terms of foreign trade have noticeably deteriorated - the price of Russian oil has fallen.
On the other hand, the situation in the economy is developing better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment is slowing down, but budget expenditures are growing.
At the same time, overall inflation risks increased.
"Therefore, this year the likelihood of raising the rate exceeds the likelihood of lowering it.
The appropriateness of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
First, the rapid acceleration of consumption in the context of increased inflationary expectations, if the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Second, a growing shortage of labor and a lag in productivity growth relative to wage growth.
And there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the future decisions of the regulator, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the forecast for inflation for the current year remains at 5 - 7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than was assumed in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been raised by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum in 2023 and 6.5 - 7.5% per annum in 2024.
"This does not exclude the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its probability and scale have decreased.
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that it may be necessary to raise the rate somewhat in order for inflation to meet the 4% target in 2024," the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual investment funds (MIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be withdrawn from the composition of existing retail mutual funds.
This will make it possible to start managing the remaining liquid assets and to resume operations with investment shares.
If more than 10% of the retail mutual fund consists of blocked securities, the management company must allocate them to a separate closed mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of the retail fund to closed.
For funds with less than 10% of blocked securities, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate the blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, there is a requirement to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities from a special mutual fund.
In the future, in the case of the implementation of such securities, management companies are obliged to make quarterly payments to the owners of investment shares of at least 90% of the proceeds, according to the Bank of Russia.
In addition to summarizing the results of the industry, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analysis and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022, the passenger turnover of air transport in Russia decreased by 6.3%, and passenger traffic decreased by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic amounted to 95.2 million people, and passenger turnover - 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger traffic amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, domestic traffic - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by government support programs.
In 2022, a program to stimulate domestic tourism was in effect, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights, prepared by Rosturizm.
In addition, several state support programs were implemented to ensure the accessibility of air transportation, including subsidies for passenger transportation, the development of regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and to recapitalize Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of state subsidies to the industry (so far, 25.3 billion rubles have been allocated) in 2023, passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will amount to 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviatsiya, up to 103.0 million people," PSB analysts share their forecasts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, a 6-year-old child died
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, became victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Another six people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot on the spot.
Later it turned out that this was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
Law enforcement agencies classified his actions as a terrorist attack, the terrorist's relatives were detained, and the house was sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental health problems and was only discharged from hospital this week.
Austria is once again tightening border controls with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people are staying at the border in cars waiting to cross over to the Austrian side.
Thus, it becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already gone through the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was filed.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those who want to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, there is a need to strengthen control.
The decision to step up inspections by Vienna followed a pledge by European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to secure the bloc's borders.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status exceeded the figures for 2016 for the first time and amounted to more than 330 thousand.
Cargo ship "Progress 83" successfully docked with the ISS
The automatic Progress 83 resupply ship successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3:45 a.m. GMT, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking occurred at an altitude of 269 statute miles over the southern part of the Pacific Ocean.
The live broadcast of the match was conducted by the NASA Flight Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists from the Flight Control Center.
From the ISS, the cargo ship was greeted by cosmonauts Sergei Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for the Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from the Russian Baikonur cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported on the depressurization of the Progress MS-21, which was prepared for separation from the ISS and subsequent sinking on February 18.
As specified in the press service of the company, the transition hatch of the ship was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" is isolated from the total volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated."
TsUP also reported that nothing threatens the ISS crew: "The temperature regime and pressure on board the station are normal.
There is no threat to the life and health of the crew, their condition is good."
"There have been more cases of birth tourism."
How pregnant Russian women got stuck in Argentina
The Migration Service of Argentina began to suspend and cancel the validity of residence permits for Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not remain living in the country.
Earlier, the republic's authorities denied entry to the country to several pregnant Russian women, who were suspected of arriving for the purposes of "maternity tourism".
On February 11, they were still allowed into Argentina by court decision.
Read more in the "Gazeta.Ru" article.
The Migration Service of Argentina began to suspend and revoke the residence permit (RP) of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not remain in the country.
The director of the service, Florencia Carignano, told C5N TV channel about this.
“What we are doing is suspending the residency of those Russians who came to get residency because their child is Argentinean, but who spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country),” she explained.
According to her, when the court considers the issue of Argentine citizenship for the Russian, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came back."
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left may have it revoked.
Against this background, on February 9 it became known that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at the airport in Argentina due to a refusal to enter the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polin, the diplomatic mission links the incident with the fact that the authorities of the republic may have considered the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, two more on the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat stressed that more pregnant women flew to Argentina, but these three in particular were issued a decree prohibiting them from entering the country.
"They were not allowed to enter the country in accordance with the migration law, where one of the grounds for not allowing entry into the country is the provision of incomplete, false, or distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, at the request of the court, the migration service of Argentina allowed pregnant Russian citizens to enter the country, said lawyer Christian Rubilar.
"An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quotes him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the Republic.
It allows for short-term trips to 171 countries without visas, including EU countries, Great Britain and Japan, notes RBC.
At the beginning of January 2023, The Guardian wrote about the "birth tourism boom" in Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, between 2,000 and 2,500 Russian citizens moved to the republic in 2022.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who are going there to give birth.
"In 2023, this number could grow to 10 thousand," he said.
In turn, Carignano earlier claimed that in 2022, about 10,500 Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and over the past few months, more than 5,800 pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how the prices for rental housing in St. Petersburg had changed.
It has become 10% cheaper.
At the same time, it is known that across the country, rent has become 25% more expensive, reports Patrol Petersburg with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-room apartment cost 25,000 rubles a month, a studio apartment cost 22,000 rubles a month, and a two-room apartment cost 36,000 rubles a month.
Experts believe that this trend may change as early as spring, when many citizens who have been abroad return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country have become known.
The Migration Service of Argentina did not let six pregnant Russian women into the country, since the purpose of their visit, which was indicated by them, turned out to be false.
TASS reports this with reference to the television channel Todo Noticias.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of the visit.
Most of them admitted that they came to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, representatives of the country did not let Russian women into Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure to follow if there are suspicions of "false" travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is in the 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she also cannot clearly tell where she is going to go on vacation, then suspicions immediately fall on her from the migration service.
Moreover, experts clarify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions".
The artist's decision to leave the theater was planned.
The laureate of the State Prize of the Russian Federation, Alexander Filippenko, stated that the decision of the Mossovet Theatre not to renew his contract was planned, in addition, everything was agreed with the management in advance.
He spoke about this in an interview with Interfax.
In the productions in which he took part, the artists from the second troupe were invited.
People's Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that in 2022 his contract expired.
All the details have long been agreed with representatives of the theater.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not going to renew the contract.
Filipppenko noted that the authorities agreed and prepared all the necessary documents.
Thus, he assures that "he did not let anyone down".
In addition, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heir in Latvia.
Filipppenko is going to undergo "long-term treatment" in a foreign country.
As stated in the publication, at the moment the film actor works in the Moscow theater as a guest actor.
According to the publication, the artist played in the Moscow City Council in such performances as "Shakespeare's Hamlet" and "The Taming of the Shrew", "Uncle Vanya", as well as "Three Sisters".
From the territories of the private sector on Friday, February 10, 340 thousand cubic meters of snow were removed from Kalininsky AO.
This information was shared in the city hall.
At the moment in Kalininsky district there are more than four hundred streets of the private sector, from which it is necessary to clear the snow by spring.
The roads will be cleaned in two stages.
The first will end on 15 February, and the second will run from 1 March to 15 April.

Authorities reported that contractors are facing the removal of snow on the roadway by residents of houses.
Kirkorov won the lawsuit against the fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man claimed that the construction of the artist was illegal, but did not appear at the hearing.
The fisherman sued the musician Philip Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier at his dacha outside Moscow.
This is reported by the Fifth Channel.
Nevertheless, it was not possible to win the case for the Saratov fisherman.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, the court was presented with documents, design projects, which confirmed the legality of all structures installed on the territory of the celebrity's home.
As the head of the law firm, Alexander Dobrovinsky, clarifies, the construction of the pier did not leave the plaintiff with any chance of going fishing.
The application for the executor was filed on January 11.
The star lawyer jokingly said that, probably, the man planned to fish exclusively from the artist's house.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his own balcony for fishing.
He emphasized that from that place it is possible to continue casting with a spinning rod.
Somnologist named the reasons for sleep problems
Otolaryngologist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often arise due to products containing caffeine.
We are talking primarily about tea, coffee, chocolate and any cocoa-containing desserts.
It is worth limiting their use before bedtime, since they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "jumpy", which means they do not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop consuming caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to reducing the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and, as a result, there are difficulties with falling asleep.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages contribute to relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams when converted to pure alcohol lead to various sleep disturbances, such as superficial sleep and frequent nocturnal awakenings.
In addition, in order to prevent problems with falling asleep, a somnologist recommends giving up spicy food and large portions.
Large volumes and spicy food contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For healthy sleep, it is not only necessary to comply with the external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, it is not worth abusing heavy food before bedtime, since it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also recalled that the absence of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and habitual activity, so it is extremely important to adhere to a sleep and rest schedule and to allow the body to recover.

Hundreds of protests against the pension reform will take place in France on Saturday
The fourth day of mass protests against the pension reform is being held by trade unions in France on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, French media reports.
After a slight decrease in the number of participants in the protests on Tuesday compared to the first two "days of mobilization," the unions hope this time to bring more protesters onto the streets, taking into account those citizens who were not able to participate in the demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies expect from 600 thousand to 800 thousand protesters across the country, including 90 thousand to 120 thousand in Paris, the media writes.
On February 7, 757,000 people took part in protests against the pension reform, according to the French Ministry of the Interior.
The largest trade union association, the General Confederation of Labour (GCL), said there were 2 million protesters.
According to VKT, 400,000 protesters also took to the streets of Paris on Tuesday.
Police say there were 57,000.
On the previous day of the protests, January 31, the number of protesters amounted to 1.27 million people, according to police estimates, and 2.8 million - according to trade unions.
The next mass protests are planned for February 16.
As reported, on January 10, French Prime Minister Elizabeth Bourne presented the government's draft pension reform project, which provides for an increase in the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
It is assumed that the established retirement age threshold will gradually be shifted from 62 years to 64 years by three months per year, and this process will last until 2030.
The new regime will be applied starting with the generations of French people born in September 1961 or later.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated during the 2022 election campaign that he was determined to carry out pension reform before the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, the French National Assembly began consideration of the government’s draft pension reform.

The depressurization of "Progress MS-21" occurred on the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos reported about the depressurization of the Progress MS-21, prepared for separation from the ISS, Kazinform International News Agency reports with reference to TASS.
"The contour of the Progress MS-21 transport cargo ship, the flooding of which is scheduled for February 18, has been depressurized, as confirmed by telemetry data received at the Mission Control Center," the Roscosmos press service reported.
As noted, at the moment it is isolated from the total volume of the station.
The reasons for the incident are being investigated, it did not affect the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo ship or the further ISS flight program.
The situation was commented on by the Executive Director of Roscosmos for manned space programs, Sergei Krikalev.
"On the cargo ship, which has been docked to the station for several months, there was a coolant leak from the thermoregulation system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to us with the ship ("Soyuz MS-22" - TASS) in mid-December," he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with "Soyuz" concluded that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure that there are no problems with the next launches.
"We need to conduct a deep analysis to make sure that this reason does not apply to similar designs in future launches.
This is the most important task that will now stand before us," he said.
According to the executive director, an analysis will have to be carried out in terms of the ship's preparation for launch, the materials that were used, and the technologies that were used in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was carried out in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
"The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error," Krikalev added.
The executive director specified that on Saturday a commission began its work, which will conduct an analysis of all possible causes.
"The ship was scheduled to be undocked and deorbited two days before the launch of the Soyuz spacecraft (Soyuz MS-23 - TASS), so there will be no serious consequences for the crew's actions, for the crew's work... From this point of view, this will not affect the program," Krikalyov noted.
The Progress MS-21 truck was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a carrier rocket on October 26.
Two days later, it docked with the small research module "Search" of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The ship delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA named the place of "Progress" depressurization
The depressurization of the Progress MS-21 cargo spacecraft at the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal control system.
This was reported by a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, which was broadcast by NASA.
Now, according to NASA, the coolant leak from Progress has stopped.
NASA believes that all the refrigerant has completely leaked out.
"This morning we had a leak of refrigerant from the thermoregulation system into space, the leak of refrigerant has stopped," said a representative of the American Mission Control Center (quoted by Interfax).
Earlier, the "Progress" module was isolated due to a loss of pressure.
Roscosmos reported that nothing threatens the cosmonauts.
Progress MS-22 docked with the ISS today, February 11, and it will be taken out of orbit, according to the plan, on February 18.
The coordinator of strategic communications at the US National Security Council, John Kirby, declined to announce a possible trip by US President Joe Biden to Ukraine.
He told reporters about this at a briefing, the broadcast was on the White House YouTube channel.
Kirby noted that he "has nothing to announce about additional points of the trip" of the American leader to Poland.
The day before, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Biden's visit to Poland from February 20 to 22.
According to a representative of the administration, during the trip, the President of the United States will discuss bilateral cooperation with the leadership of Poland, as well as joint efforts to support Ukraine and strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities.
Earlier, Kirby said that Biden would visit Ukraine when the time was right, but now is not the time for official visits.

Fitness expert called walks in winter an excellent way to lose weight without intense exercise
Fitness expert Anthony Young talked about effective interval training outdoors for weight loss.
His words are quoted by the portal Eat This, Not That.
The specialist called active walks in winter an excellent way to reduce weight without intense exercise, as well as to improve the condition of the cardiovascular system and psychological health.

Then, for one minute, walk as fast as you can without breaking into a run.
One minute - at normal pace," explains Eng.
It is necessary to make three approaches.
Then the specialist advises to do lunges or squats with weights for 15 seconds, after which to walk at a comfortable speed for another 45 seconds.

The head of Serpukhov checked the condition of residential buildings
Head of Serpukhov Sergei Nikitenko made a working tour of the territories.
Together with representatives of managing organizations, he inspected the condition of multi-apartment and residential buildings.
The addresses that received the most appeals from residents were found to be under the strictest control.
- Many of the comments are quite justified and relate, first of all, to the cleaning of entrances and the maintenance of common areas.
The people of Serpukhov themselves are not standing aside and are actively fighting the problem of vandalism, especially the widespread graffiti.
We will work out the issue taking into account the Safe Region cameras, said the head of the municipality Sergei Nikitenko.

Deputy CEO of RZD proposed to the Governor of Irkutsk region to develop new sales channels
The Irkutsk region needs to continue to develop alternative sales markets in addition to the Far East.
This is both the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
Deputy CEO of Russian Railways Alexei Shilo made such a proposal at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reported on February 10, 2023.
- As the practice of last year showed, even despite the geographical location of Irkutsk region, this decision can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of companies constantly interact with our "neighbors" (ports, operators, maritime transport) and find optimal pricing conditions for the transportation of their products under new schemes, emphasized Aleksey Shilo.
The Governor noted the importance of stable shipments of products, the Irkutsk region is one of the richest mineral resource regions of the Russian Federation and has significant reserves of hard coal and brown coal.
Around 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of the shipment of products for export has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also stressed that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metal products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything possible to provide support for transportation volumes.
If additional shipment volumes appear on the domestic market, we are also ready to provide assistance in this direction, said Aleksei Shilo.
Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with the active citizens of the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo
By order of the head of the region Igor Kobzev, the Chairman of the Government of the Angara Region, Konstantin Zaitsev, worked in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo in the Irkutsk region today.
In the village of Granovshchyna, the Chairman of the Government got acquainted with the work of the new educational institution - Granovshchyna School, which was opened in September 2022.
The facility was built as part of the federal project "Modern School" of the national project "Education".
The following facilities are located in eight school blocks: classrooms, a dining hall, a kitchen, an auditorium, two gyms, club rooms, a library, administrative offices, toilets, public restrooms, and a medical facility.
240.8 million rubles were allocated from the federal budget for construction, more than 512 million rubles from regional funds, and more than 72 million rubles from the municipal formation.
In addition, a regional subsidy was allocated for the purchase of equipment in the amount of 64.2 million rubles.
After the opening at the school, in addition to children from the village of Granovshchina, children from the Urikovskaya school, which was undergoing repairs, also took part.
Classes are conducted by more than 100 teachers, of which almost 90 are subject teachers.
In 2022, a bus was allocated to the school, purchased by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation under a federal program.
Capital repairs to Homutovskaya Secondary General Education School No. 2 began in 2022.
Students of the first grades were distributed in Homutovskaya School No. 1, the senior grades are studying in the second building of School No. 2.
According to the renovation plan, the roof, engineering infrastructure, windows and related elements will be replaced, the facade will be renovated, and the interior of the premises will be refurbished.
An important component of the capital repairs is the re-creation of a heating point with water heating, instead of which dry heat was used.
The cost of all the work is more than 80 million roubles.
The repairs are in the final stages, there are problems with connecting to the power grid - an increase in capacity is needed, work is underway with the power supply organization.
In addition, in Granovschina and in Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom the developers sold houses illegally connected to the electrical grid.
It was decided that the network company would organize a personal reception for legal settlement of these issues next week.
- Very often the issue of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electricity for heating.
Therefore, sellers often illegally connect homes to nearby networks, and this is already a reason for disconnection of electricity supply.
Therefore, now network companies in those territories where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue, emphasized Konstantin Zaitsev.
Anatoly Prokopyev assessed the effectiveness of state support measures for small and medium-sized businesses in the agricultural sector
The head of UOBO Anatoly Prokopyev visited three family farms in the Ekhirit-Bulagatsky District today.
The head of the KFH in the village of Kapsal, Yulia Madaeva, received a grant for the development of her farm as a beginner farmer in 2014.
One of the main activities of the farm is the production of livestock products.
Every year the livestock population is increasing and gross production of meat and milk is growing.
Later, thanks to state support, it became possible in 2019 to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family dairy livestock farm.
To date, the cattle population in the farm is about 150 heads, 60 of which are cows.
In addition, grain crops are grown here, and annual fodder crops are sown.
Thanks to the activities of the KFH of Viktor Katanayev, the locality of Kharyashino in the village of Kulunkun has been reclassified as a settlement.
The farm is engaged in the breeding and fattening of dairy cattle.
In 2014, he received a grant for the development of a family dairy cattle farm with 60 heads.
To date, the farm has a herd of 150 cattle.
Potatoes have also been grown here for many years.
The head of the KFH tries to create all the necessary conditions for the team to work and live.
There is now an entire village on the estate.
Anatoly Prokopyev took under personal control the issue of building two km of road from the area of Kharyashino to Ust-Orda.
The main activities of the KFH of Stalina Mogzoeva in the village of Otonkhoi are the breeding of cattle and water buffalo.
In 2020, the farm participated in a competitive selection and received an AGROSTARTUP grant for the development of a meat farm.
With these funds, a tractor trailer, two press sorters and a mower were purchased.
The head of the farm annually increases the number of livestock and increases gross meat production.
In addition, the KFH sows annual forage crops on an area of 40 ha.
In Stalin's plans, Mogzoeva was going to open a feedlot.
According to the results of the visit to three farms, the head of the district noted that state support measures are effective, necessary, and essential.
- The government of Irkutsk region pays great attention to agriculture.
Therefore, state support should not only be maintained, but also increased and improved.
We, in turn, must be the guarantor of food security.
Agricultural producers of the district fulfill this role with honor, - Anatoly Prokopyev emphasized.
The crossing on the Armenian-Turkish border was opened for the first time in decades to deliver humanitarian aid
The Margara-Aldzhan border crossing on the Turkey-Armenia border was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
This is reported by Turkish and Armenian media.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, notes the Turkish agency Anadolu.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, said Serdar Kilic, Ankara's special representative for Armenian-Turkish negotiations.
He expressed gratitude to the Vice Speaker of the Parliament of Armenia Ruben Rubinyan and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the assistance provided by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-stricken region," Kılıç wrote on his Twitter account.
The press secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia, Vahan Unanyan, in turn, reported that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border through the Margara bridge and are heading to the earthquake-stricken region.
As Public Radio of Armenia reports, the last time the car crossed the Margahar bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish agency "Anadolu" cites other data and writes that the border point of Margara-Aldzhan was last used for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Armenia to eliminate the consequences of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
At that time, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was sent to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to the earthquake-stricken areas of Syria.
According to the latest data, more than 25 thousand people died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
On February 11, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reported that 21,848 deaths were already known in Turkey.
The Syrian side reported 3,553 deaths.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are overshadowed mainly by the fact that Ankara refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss issues of normalization.
In February 2022, commercial air traffic between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border for citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

"Submission of the year".

"Fernandez is Makélélé plus Lampard.
If you need him to play in the Makelele role, he can play there very well.
This guy also has a good sense of goal, a good shot from outside the penalty area, so if you need him to play as an attacking midfielder like Lampard or Essien, he can do it," Crespo told the British media.

You can bet on the triumph of the Madrid team, taking into account extra time and a penalty shootout, for 1.14, this market for Al-Hilal is at 5.80.
The team from Saudi Arabia overcame two rounds on the way to the final, beating the Moroccan "Wydad" in a penalty shootout and the Brazilian "Flamenco" in regular time (3:2).

Guberniev spoke about the fact that midfielder Pavel Mamaev made the decision to end his playing career.
Famous TV commentator Dmitry Guberniev spoke about the fact that midfielder Pavel Mamaev made the decision to end his playing career.
"Now it will be possible to cast a bust of the hero in his homeland.
He made a big mistake and for most people he will be remembered not as a footballer but as a rule-breaker.
But he is still far from Kokorin.
Because no one was able to exhaust their potential as much as Kokorin.
Despite all his talents, Mamaev was periodically noticeable.
I can only wish him good luck and for him to realize himself somewhere else," Metaratings.ru quotes Guberniev as saying.
The last club of the 34-year-old midfielder was Khimki.
The suburban club did not extend the contract with the midfielder in the summer of 2022.
Mamayev previously played for Torpedo, CSKA, Krasnodar, and Rostov.
Mamaev is the Russian champion, three-time winner of the Russian Cup and two-time winner of the Russian Super Cup with CSKA.

A tanker with a diesel engine from a previously Russian-flagged vessel was not allowed into the port of Spain
The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of Merchant Fleet of the Ministry of Transport of Spain has prohibited the vessel Maersk Magellan from entering the city's port to unload diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel vessel, which sailed under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
"The Maritime Command of the Tarragona Headquarters of the Trade Fleet of the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has prohibited the entry into the port of Tarragona for the unloading of diesel fuel on the vessel "Maersk Magellan" under the flag of Singapore, because the cargo it is carrying comes from the vessel under the Cameroonian flag "Nobel", which until July 1, 2022, sailed under the Russian flag," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was adopted in accordance with the legislation of the European Union, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag from April 16, 2022, or that has changed its flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry specified that the check was carried out on February 9, after which the ban was agreed.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships have been prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the port of Barcelona denied access to the Maltese-flagged Black Star vessel, which was carrying cargo from a Russian-flagged vessel.
In 2022, after the strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU, USA and Great Britain introduced restrictions on the supply of Russian petroleum products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.
Since December 5, 2022, a price ceiling has been introduced on sea shipments of oil from the Russian Federation by hostile countries.
At that time, a ceiling was set for Russian oil at $60/barrel.
Also, since December 5, the EU embargo on sea shipments of oil from Russia has been in effect.
Problems with entry into Argentina for pregnant Russian women have been explained
According to the expert, against the backdrop of the influx of those wishing to give birth to a child in Argentina, the country's authorities have become more attentive to the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
Difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are connected with the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a mass influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves and then leave.
This is reported by Lenta.ru with reference to SPbGU Professor Viktor Heifetz, editor-in-chief of the magazine "Latin America".
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of turning the country into a transit point rather than a final destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the court will make a decision on granting an Argentine passport to the parents after obtaining a residence permit.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left, they may be denied citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina provides citizenship under the "right of soil", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport opens up the possibility of visa-free travel to 170 countries, including EU states and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began to withdraw residence permits for Russians who received the document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It was also reported that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina on suspicion of providing false information about the purpose of their trip.
In Russia, the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs is predicted
In Russia, the interest of citizens in fitness services is being restored, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year, more than 400 new facilities may open in the country, mainly small-format ones.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to Kommersant, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8,600 clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-format projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
Such data is provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators Olga Kiselyova noted in a conversation with the publication that the 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NFS President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, there have been more closures of clubs than openings.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
At the same time, independent analysts cite other figures.
According to "Kontur.Fokus", over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main type of activity "work of a fitness center" has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5,120 of them.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but as early as 2021 it began to recover.
According to 2GIS data, there are 4,500 fitness clubs in Russian cities with over a million residents.
Russians began to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
As a result of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year-on-year.
Silina noted that if the trend continues, the industry will return to pre-crisis indicators by the end of the year.
The management company from Kirov had its license taken away
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region annulled the license for the management of multi-apartment buildings issued to the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, by decision of the regional Arbitration Court, the license for the management of multi-apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Zabota" was annulled.
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but it only came into legal force in February 2023.
The arbitration court deprived "Uravlyak" of its license for the fact that the organization several times ignored the requirements of the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently, all facilities that were under the management of "Zabota" have been excluded from the register of licenses for the management of multi-apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The fact that they were left without a management company is known to the administration of Kirov.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor of the situation.
Recall that in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set a task for employees of the State Housing Inspectorate to eliminate two-thirds of the region's management companies by spring, since there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands raised doubts among the Kirov Communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the same position could be taken by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
Antimonopoly officials also allegedly asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the region's head's actions.

At the same time, they must be designed in certain colors and have a specified image.
The packages are purchased at the expense of the owners of PVO, if this obligation is not fulfilled, a fine of 10,000 rubles is imposed on them for each violation.
Earlier, Wildberries customers accused the platform of debiting funds from cards, the data of which were previously deleted from the personal account.
As buyers fear, this is associated with great security risks.
The support service, in turn, explained that this is provided for in the user agreement.
As follows from it, the company has the right to debit money from remote cards without notifying the client if payment from other sources does not go through for one reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, stated that calculations with buyers are carried out with the permission of customers, and there can be no leakage of bank card data.
Photos from February 2023.
A beautiful place especially in the summer, around the sculpture of a mammoth with a gazebo and grills.
On the territory there is a small park where you can take a walk with your family.
Large car park.
The store is located on the first floor of the Univer City shopping center.
Hours of operation from 10-00 to 22-00.
In the store you can drink coffee and have a snack of fresh baked goods.
There is a small parking lot from the mall.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, a wide selection of syrups and alternative milk.
Delicious fresh baked goods😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
Convenient cafeteria area
Came with my daughter to get my pension.
They welcomed us warmly, explained everything clearly, scanned the documents, filled out the application, and told us how to sign up for future appointments.
At the entrance, the administrator and the security guards greet you politely and with respect.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, but a cooler with water would be nice to purchase.
We came 2 times, everything was great!
I wish all workers peace, good, luck and a decent salary, in this difficult time for everyone!!!
Simply a great place!
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of Glühwein, waiting for the shrimp salad (which is absolutely delicious!!!)
I strongly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
A sweet cashier asked me if I wanted a coffee with me or in the room, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked in the hall, 300 ml.
After a couple of minutes, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted to be in ceramics, that's why I'm "in the hall".
They did it to me.
I ask why in a glass, and not in a cup.
The girl answers that they don't have cups with a volume of 300 ml.
How does this fit into a person's head?
Ask yourself or in the room, i.e. determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or a disposable cup.
Get the answer - in the hall, i.e. in the cup.
Specify the volume.
To hear that 300 ml.
Put a person in front of the fact that there are no cups of this volume.
Here, he says, is a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in the Green Oasis that I can remember.
It is doubly noteworthy that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink coffee the way I want. I asked for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Are the Green Corner Cafe and the Green Corner parties of the same medal or are they in no way connected with each other?
If unrelated, there is understanding.
If connected - why did the food and trade enterprise, known in the city for its service and quality, stoop to the rhetoric of a kiosk at Kazan Station?
Rhetoric, because such a case, I repeat, happens to me for the third time.
I do not exclude that this is happening not only to me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she acted on a whim.
I hope I am wrong.
Please describe the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to service it.
We really like the circus, we go there since our childhood.
I saw the numbers with Yury Nikulin himself.
And now with children, nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, and I like the programmes too.
The location of the places is very convenient.
The arena is visible from almost any point, and the backs of those in front of you do not interfere.
The circus is very intimate, family!
this time we went to the New Year program.
We were a little disappointed.
Many clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with tricks and more animals.
It's a pity that now you can't take photos with animals in the foyer.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
And in general, a very pleasant place!!
I wish you prosperity and to please us with your numbers!!!
I liked the developer, Otdelstroy, who chooses good places to build residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before the purchase, we were invited to look at the complex, when there were still no walls, so that we could see everything with our own eyes, although we looked at so many apartments and none of the developers offered this to us.
Favourite ski resort in Russia!
The most fun is the gentle, sparse forests e, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks, in my opinion, are boring and short.
The longest on the sector e, there is even less.
But overall a great atmosphere, lots of different cafes and bars, so a fun ski vibe is guaranteed!
Great Peri master!
She did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, and the interior of the car was clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a cloakroom and water.
Disgusting service.
The second time I come for an order by the time of readiness, which is indicated in the application, and I wait at the windowsill for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Today, in business, such a service is unacceptable!
The response of the "caring" service is that we are trying.
At the box office, even without apologies, just - we are not to blame, it's the program.
You did not call to warn, you did not find any other technical means of communication with your previously loyal customers.
Impotent people are "trying", and businesses need to work.
Thank you all, goodbye.
We will not order any more from you and we will not recommend you either.
Spoiled mood, waiting for guests, apologies from the hostess - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
The car was supposed to be delivered in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but in fact it took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border between Lithuania and Belarus (Lithuania was responsible).
As a result, I am very happy with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always available, up-to-date information, professional advice and a normal human attitude.
Thanks again!
We rented a cottage for 4 days for 3 people.
The huts are clean, cozy, warm (even very), the hut has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all necessary dishes.
Cleaning products and a sponge are available.
Among the disadvantages, one can single out the fact that there is not even too little space, and the shower in the bathroom is terribly small.
There are no places to store snowboards or skis, and there is nowhere to dry clothes, so I had to borrow a dryer from the owners and shove it in place of a chair, and put a heater under it.
But in general, it's not a bad option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There is wine and beer for those who want to drink.
Center of Moscow, I recommend
A wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come again.
On the territory there are all necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good repair and all amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, we walked around during our visit to Kaliningrad.
I really liked it, and the Russia in miniature, and the Ozerov Park and the landscape.
In winter, there are many hills that are natural for children)
A very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We are constantly buying here, prices are low, and the quality is great!
Very responsive staff, will advise and answer all questions of interest)
I recommend everyone to visit this store! ❤️
Location is convenient for everyone.
It's normal for me personally.
They serve quickly, if none of the visitors screws up.
It's convenient to record.
The staff is attentive, they will advise, direct, and consult even if you come not on reception days.
In principle, it's okay.
Great guys!
Thank you very much!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, and the prices are reasonable compared to other services.
I thought it was a release button, and they are all so clever that they did everything for me.
Huge thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery 2 hours before March 8.
They delivered the flowers in a package that looked like it had been stolen (barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it to the photo on the website and the color was completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to count them again and it turned out that there were an even number of tulips, 20.
Support in Vkontakte on my indignation about the color and quantity of flowers answered "apparently they mixed up the color".
The next day I wrote again and I was offered to reimburse 15%.
It seems to me that this is an extreme degree of impudence and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a statement to the tax authorities about the fact that they refused to give me a receipt.
Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next in line.
I would not recommend anyone to deal with this organization.
For more than 10 years I have been going to the master Samira, for coloring and hair cutting.
I want to cancel The professionalism of the master Samira, she does a great job, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I strongly recommend this master to all relatives and friends.
All of her work is always done at the highest level!!’
A huge thank you to Master Samira 😍
I greeted was in this gambling club, I can say that the prices are great, a lot of gaming computers, as well as drinks and food.
Among the minuses, some keyboards are broken, the buttons fly off, if we take the "usual game process", then the computers do not pull well: (
Therefore, the rating is 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to his group, and the mother goes to the fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are super-attentive, the trainers are professional.
They organize themed holidays for children, monitor cleanliness and equipment.
It's nice to walk and exercise.
A 6-year-old child already holds a blow well, a strong OCF.
Recommended for children, moms and dads)
The best craftsmen!
Irina is just gold!!
The work is done qualitatively, caring, everything is clarified.
With girls you can always talk about something!
It was the third time!
I wouldn't regret it for anything!
Finally, I can grow my hair after lightening it!
And Vita is also studying color theory.
Therefore, it is she who will soon be able to combine blonde with keratin!
And your hair will tell you THANK YOU🥰🥰
Reception master Elena Polianskaya is a very responsive master, she clearly explained everything that is included in the scheduled maintenance.
Also, during the repair of my car, she provided all kinds of assistance.
And also thanks to the master Valery Ushakov for his attentive and professional work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was carried out qualitatively.
The only thing that confused me when registering for the inspection was the insufficiently correct information about the work regulations, but when I showed up for the inspection, the regulations were more clearly explained.
I want to express my deepest gratitude to the Administration staff.
We needed a very rare certificate for the guardianship authorities to approve the real estate deal, the employees were very friendly and helped to issue this certificate, although they could have refused, since this is not their responsibility.
Thank you very much!
Very nice people work here.
Wonderful, sincere, polite employees, I am not sorry that I came to this hairdresser's!👍
Master Nakhid did an impeccable dyeing, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend everyone ❤️
I really liked it in the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
Restored for the 800th anniversary, everything inside is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on a tour, that was great too.
And I definitely recommend the Russian collection of the Nizhny Novgorod art museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection
I have known Olya for more than 3 years, and we use her services regularly.
During this time, we have seen how Olya develops in her favorite business, constantly learns new things and expands the space for four-legged animals, which only causes admiration and trust.
We always leave our puppy with a calm mind.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be picked up/taken away by a zoo taxi.
And they will also bring a clean and tasty one)
in general a fairy tale 🥰
We thank you for the care and attentive personal attitude to our pets 🐕💜
The Hungry Elk restaurant is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is varied.
Before visiting, it is advisable to order seats in advance, especially on Fridays!
A lovely well-maintained zoo.
Less than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
There were on weekdays - adult entrance 300₽, schoolchild 170.
There were not many people, we walked around with pleasure, looked at the animals.
The vulture was impressed)
In Moscow, by the way, he has not been seen.
On the territory there are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices, the toilet is clean and free, we also saw a charging station for phones.
In general, I recommend it 👍
Salon at the highest level!!!
I am very satisfied with the services of cosmetologist Kuznetsova Natalia, I only go to her.
I do various facial cleanses - both mechanical and with a device.
I am 100% satisfied.
Master of his craft👍
Everything tells in detail about the peculiarity of the skin, picked up cosmetics caring for my skin type, just perfect.
Now I am happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you Natalia!!!
Great club with huge space, pool, sauna, hammam and great trainers!
The downside is the huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the changing room area.
It feels like they come to the club as a public bath!
Particular emphasis on the women's department.
During the weekdays, starting from 19:00, there are a lot of people!
I give three and only because of the first visit, when I got to the consultant, if I'm not mistaken, Timur, but I could be wrong.
I processed everything quickly, told everything +/-, everything is understandable, my son also decided to process the card, and alas, the consultants are busy with their own affairs, customers are waiting, the consultant finally approached my son, who understands everything, several times went to the negotiation room, which was fun to discuss, in the end, my son left without processing anything, the consultant said, well, if you want, as you want, since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
The new office, in the new format, everything is comfortable and this attitude.
It's a pity that the first impression was spoiled, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of employees.
The choice is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to lint), the staff know their range, they help with choosing styles.
It is possible to dress both a slim child and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
They are located near the metro, even a small parking lot is available.
We recommend!
I was there in September, celebrating my birthday.
In principle, the service and the quality of the food were all to my liking: the prices are low, the portions are medium-sized, so you can eat your fill, or order again.
The only complaint is the reservation of the table.
When I ordered, I indicated the number and all that was required, after which I immediately called the bot to check the phone.
After that, there is nothing left.
When he arrived at the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table had not been reserved.
We were lucky that there were free seats and we managed to accommodate us.
But, in fact, it is a very good restaurant with an excellent "Price/Quality" ratio.
I recommend it!
Went for a cleaning in the recent weekend.
For the first time, I see such an organized staff, who treated my many questions with the utmost care, and advised me on how and what to do for further dental treatment.
I wholeheartedly recommend it, the only clinic where they do not want to warm up for money in my memory.
A good shopping center.
There is everything!
A large assortment of goods.
Variety of shops.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
I will never step foot in this store again.
bought a washing machine, said that we are outside the city, so we will take it ourselves.
the manager in the hall said where to drive up to the warehouse, to the question "will it be loaded"? said yes. ))
they took it out of the warehouse without a box, and when I asked why, they said that's how everything is shipped.
when I started to insist, they put two strips of foam rubber, like it will go away!
refused to load into the trailer, saying it's not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery )))
when I said that I would then refuse the order, they said "okay, whatever you want, we don't care" and in the end, one of them even came down from the ramp to help my father push the car into the trailer.
I am facing such rude service for the first time.
A good shopping center Clean and tidy.a wide range of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a "Kosmik" cinema and the "Nevidailia" children's entertainment center.
On the lower floor there is a large hypermarket "Lenta".
Convenient, large parking, convenient location.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, lingerie and home goods.
Various assortment, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the choice, give advice.
Everyone will find something necessary for themselves.
A good place to spend an evening.
The staff is very good, a pleasant place.
I advise everyone to never make a mistake in choosing.The best establishment in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be super.
I recommend to visit)
We would like to express our gratitude to Marina Chasova, who was our agent for organizing the funeral.
When she came to us on a call, she took on herself to solve all the issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us to choose everything we needed, was always on the line and informed us about how things were going.
Thanks to her, we conducted a loved one with dignity.
Everything was arranged, clearly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, perfectly understanding the state of her loved ones, gave advice on how it would be better and simply sympathized with us on a human level.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
Intrigued by the many good reviews, I contacted "RemStirMash" and I was assigned master Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that the next day he would be completely free and ready to serve.
Everyone discussed and appointed a time - 14.00.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the master and a statement that he would not be able to come, a complicated application (what is this? and where is "completely free"?), and if he could, he would come after 18.00 instead of the appointed 14.00.
We agreed to meet again the next day.
15 minutes before the scheduled time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander, he can come, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
One and a half days of empty waiting, all the planned things on the side!
In short, a competent master Ivan arrived, fixed the breakdown, for which he is thanked.
So don't be fooled by empty promises and don't waste your time.
The evening observations did not live up to expectations at all.
First there was a small lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked through the telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children climbed to watch several times, adults crowded and could not give others a chance to watch.
The objects we looked at in the telescope were the size of an ordinary star, and you can look at them for free without a telescope.
The girl answered the questions not very accessible, not understanding that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear why 600r.
Amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in town, been around since the early 2000s.
A cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price is average.
Sit down, eating 2-3 dishes for two (the portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 rubles👌
There are interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Boracho is highly recommended to try.
Price 420 rubles for 0.5 l.
And in general, the cuisine in the restaurant itself is very tasty, I don't know about others, but I really enjoyed it, I will advise my friends to definitely go there)
Excellent store, I have been buying goods from them for a long time, since the opening.
Good quality products.
I bought a mixer five years ago, and it still works perfectly and is in good condition.
Therefore, when we did a global renovation in the apartment, we took everything we needed right here.
Excellent filling!!!
It is located very conveniently, there is both the city center and the countryside, in general, it is convenient)!
The quality of the gas is good, I fill up 2 times a week for more than 2 years, there are no problems, the price is great!!!
Cubs by the card and for cash, do not deceive by the liter.
Shop, I liked it!
You can choose any model, at a democratic price, and for any purpose!
Staff, always ready to help in the choice.
Took a notebook to the daughter, for study, because her notebook was covered.
Helped, picked up, gave a guarantee (a month) Thank you! 👍
A sommelier is working.
he helped with the selection of wine, because in such a large menu it is difficult to understand on your own.
The experience of working with a sommelier is interesting, charming Vasily, there are not enough people like him in Moscow.
I ate the pike-perch - it was magic, thanks to the chef.
Children's menu as everywhere: macaroni, fries, chicken cutlets. I ate pizza, it's AMAZING here!
Adults appreciated the truffle, and children with sausage and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - it's a bomb, soft, juicy, aromatic.
The staff is good, everyone is smiling and friendly.
We liked it.
A completely new WB pickup point is located in a convenient place.
Working schedule, from 10.00 to 21.00, without weekends and holidays.
Inside the PVZ there are dressing rooms.
Very good place.
Real professionals work here, who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat in Vkontakte for informative communication.
Fast issuance.
It is pleasing that the goods can be immediately viewed and tried on.
It's great that it's near the house.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything that is stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, a large selection of dishes for every taste.
Convenient entrance, its own parking lot near the entrance.
Solid 5.
A wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different performances.
Today we went to see the play "The Little Mermaid".
At the moment, this is the best of children's performances.
It was very interesting, a lot of dolls, special effects.
Even the 14-year-old son went just for the company, but said that it was a very good performance.
Stayed with my husband for 10 days in January 2023.
The vacation was a success at "5", I liked everything!
I'll start in order:
On the day of check-in, they called to confirm the time of our arrival, gave us information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price was 850r), we arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, they let us through the gate without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, they processed it quickly, in about 15-20 minutes.
There is an elevator in all buildings, which is a big plus!
The 2-bed room is spacious, the floor is warm both in the room and in the bathroom (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in the 5th building).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not very small, there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in building 5.
Everything is clean, they change towels and linen at your request, but if you do not ask to change, they still change on the 4th day, and the linen is of good quality.
The territory is well-kept, there are stalls everywhere, clean sidewalks, and beautiful lighting at night.
A minibus goes to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
Until the stop of public transport 5 min.
In the dining hall, the friendly guys always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but who goes with whom, we were all satisfied, and the choice and quality, there was always fish and chicken and sandwiches or the like, vegetables as a side dish every day, homemade tasty pastries, more than 4 drinks, coffee beans, they always bake pancakes for breakfast, only the cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16°C, and the sun was shining.
Everything was to our liking, we really had a rest.
There is a desire to come again and just in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It is a pity that the swimming pool will not be put into operation and the fitness center.
Thank you to the whole team of the sanatorium for their harmonious and high-quality work!
We have been going to "Polet" since August.
Daughter turned 4 in September.
She really likes everything, the coach praises her) this is the most important thing.
We go to see Valeria Nikolayevna Pleshkova!)
I never would have thought that my daughter is so flexible!
Wandering through the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to take a look at this promising establishment - and we were not disappointed!
Prices are very affordable, and the incredibly delicious pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, even the crusts do not remain.
Pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in a word, I recommend it:)
It so happened that I ended up in Tomarovskaya Hospital with high blood pressure and a racing heart.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover, windowsills, furniture, doors are wiped down.
Baby food, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 in the morning they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, everyone puts both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
As long as the drip is in place, they will come in, ask how you are feeling...
Earlier, I had to do an ultrasound of the heart, but like this - for the first time (unfortunately, I do not know the name of the doctor, a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Klavdiya Fedorovna!
A real professional: attentive, knowledgeable, gives a comprehensive answer to any question; she selected the dosage and medications that normalized my blood pressure and heart rate, which I was previously unable to achieve after consulting other doctors.
Many thanks to the chief physician Mevshi Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the coordinated work of the hospital!!!
Thanks to the medical staff, cleaners, and porters!
When visiting the customer service, the impression was good.
In the hall I met the administrator.
Competent and polite specialists quickly and patiently help customers with all the questions asked.
The specialist provided assistance in submitting the application and gave explanations on my question.
For a small store, a very good selection of goods.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, various small things.
It works 24 hours a day, which is very convenient, always friendly staff
It's cool when there is a place in the city where you can go skiing.
The bumper lifts and on weekends, of course, there is a queue of 40 seconds and a queue of 5-10 minutes.
But on the whole, it's great, I'm immersed in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if there's mud and damp on the roads.
I turned to the service for the repair of the iPhone 11 Pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master Alexander directly, who explained all the subtleties of the repair and immediately indicated the price range.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done qualitatively.
The masters are very pleasant to communicate with, they will show everything and tell everything.
However, when replacing parts, the camera was hit, the focus was off.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected in the shortest possible time, everything works fine.
There are good specialists in this service, with whom it is a pleasure to have a dialogue.
Prices, in comparison with other services, are acceptable, affordable.
If the repair is needed again - I will definitely contact you!
Large-scale, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the condition requires close, prompt and high-quality attention of restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to creators, not maintainers
Great condo
Responsive concierges, garbage is removed, clean and beautiful on the territory, close to stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
We opened a good, cozy place of rest in our area.
There are all necessary shops.
A killing and diverse food court in terms of food.
The tables are located in cozy areas.
There is no crowding.
Well, we've been, we've tried...
The interior has nothing in common with an Italian cozy cafe...
There are very few seats, and the tables are rectangular, like in a cafeteria.
Pizza... well, who hasn't tried something tastier, that's why it seemed to me to be somewhat faceless.
I didn't really like the fact that the waiter was always standing behind your back and your interlocutor across from you was almost always looking you in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, tasty.
We will not come here again and I will not recommend it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best hairdresser I have ever been to.
She does everything very carefully and qualitatively, I go to her with pleasure, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I also only take my daughter to see Lena.
The atmosphere in the cabin is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We with Nizhny, on the way we broke down, kind people from KatResurs quickly reacted and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, more of such good people!
And in the server there it is clean and good!
They came to see Sergei Chigarkov's concert.
A great concert venue, wonderful sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come to the planned concerts this year.
Quiet place, wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music on weekends and holidays!
The staff is nice and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
Review is the highest, I adore this place ❤
The park is in the center of the city, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, there is a place for both children and adults.
But there hasn't been any sand in the playground for a long time, just dust.
There is also a fenced football field, which, unfortunately, is not very well-maintained.
But there are more advantages in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear arrangement of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at the Crossroads.
The staff is friendly.
I didn't get bad products.
Often shares and discounts.
It's great that it's close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
Went to the bar twice, everything was great, friendly staff, tasty food and most importantly - great music, the DJs know what they are doing.
The only thing is that the soloist of the group "Up in Arms Band" is disappointing the second time.
Not only does he sing, to put it mildly, not very well, but he also reads the lyrics of most of the songs from his phone, which was particularly striking when it came to the songs by the group "Ruki Vverkh".
It's somehow illogical (performing at the Hands Up bar, in the Hands Up Band group).
We stayed at the beginning of March.
Good hotel, nice rooms.
They gave me a room with a view of the Kremlin for my birthday.
Room cleaning every day.
Refill water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change towels.
Breakfast was just amazing.
There is a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order a meal from the restaurant to your room, you will pay a 20% service charge on top.
Prices in the restaurant are slightly overpriced.
It tastes like three and a half out of five.
The water park was included in the cost of accommodation.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was just a bomb.
Everything is great, but the departure was a bit disappointing: no goodbye, no good road.
The employee at the entrance did not even help to open the door, seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
We need to work on this to maintain our reputation.
A great place to get together with friends to steam.
A large and comfortable sauna, there is billiards, an outdoor pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh)
Workshop at the level!
In a short time, he has already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 male and 1 female).
Everything is fine.
Quality of work at height.
Special thanks to the master for his careful attitude and the quality of his work!
A great basketball school!
The son is 5 months old and he really likes it, he waits for every training with impatience.
An individual approach to children, interesting activities, a warm and friendly atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff will go, I order online myself.
Great location of the store.
Plus, there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good
Good AV store - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their helpfulness!
There are cafeterias with several tables.
I often visit - everything is fine!
Good pool!
I specifically about the "frog", our coach Anastasia Vitalyevna is very liked by the child and is professional!!
The locker rooms are clean, the water is warm, and there are hairdryers!
I love the croissant bakery, the service, the croissants, the breakfasts and the coffee are always top notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the cash register never made the coffee, until I reminded them, they made it, but it was impossible to drink, it smelled bad and left a taste of spoiled milk, I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, they replaced it.
Please be more careful, I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows are here!
Victoria perfectly adjusts, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which effectively removes all the fluff, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected according to the type of hair and skin, thanks to which the paint lasts a long time.
It's better not to do eyebrows!
Thank you very much for organizing the move of my mother!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very clearly, quickly, qualitatively.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my acquaintances!
Everything is at the highest level.
We have been treating teeth for the whole family at NovoDent for a long time.
Recently, I had my son's 8-year-old teeth treated, everything went perfectly, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You do not have to wait long, there are no queues because the reception is by appointment.
In my opinion, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I am not a shawarma lover, BUT when I want something unhealthy, only here and only here.
Tasty, fresh meat with a lot of filling.
And I just don't understand why, but it never flows out of me.
Often when you finish eating shawarma, you don't eat it anymore because there's a lot of sauce and water, in short, fufu... but not here.
Therefore, guys, you are the best🙂
Good teaching staff.
The cafeteria always serves fresh food.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held throughout the school year
Pleasant store, polite employees, not bad selection.
However, the big minus is that the goods, which are brought, are apparently destroyed right in the store.
Sometimes there is little space to pass between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are right on the floor, without pallets, but this is more of a remark to the organization, rather than to a specific store
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict magnificence, which is carefully looked after.
I received a double pleasure from the concert, largely due to the atmosphere of the House of Culture.
While we waited for the start in the foyer, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that it was really a way out into the light.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
I stumbled upon this online auto parts store completely by accident.
I called, gave the vincode, they said wait)
After 10 minutes they called back, offered several options.
Since the car is personal-work, he did not save and asked to order a good set of LUK clutch.
Another 5 minutes later they called back and said that there was good news for you.
If you take not the whole basket + disc + scraper, but take the LUK basket + disc kit and separately the LUK scraper, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
After taking the clutch, I went to the service.
When removing the gearbox, it turned out that a flywheel was still needed, and the faster, the better.
I already knew where to turn), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment over the phone (the first time I paid for it when I received it).
The next day the crankshaft was in my hands.
The car is happy with the new crankshaft and clutch, I am happy that everything came quickly, that they went to meet.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop
The New Year's party was a great success, but with nuances.
I booked a two-seater table, it turned out I was seated at a four-seater.
But it's not a problem.
It's just strange that they didn't warn us.
The kitchen is a four, the fish was a complete failure.
The host with competitions made at the school level, to be honest, is not very good.
BUT about the music everything is perfect.
The atmosphere was at its best.
Everything else seems like quibbling.
Thank you for the event
I leave my feedback with words of gratitude to all the staff of the maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
Only people who know and love their work work in this institution, doctors and nurses are great.
Both in the department of obstetrics and gynecology, and in the maternity ward, and in the postpartum department.
But I express special gratitude to Kotlyarova E.Yu., this is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., this is an obstetrician in the maternity ward, thank you very much for your help in the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
Wonderful store.
A wide range of balls, always fast order formation and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We visited the place on the recommendation.
The food is amazing, the entertainment is non-existent, the waiters are a bit cheeky, but we were in great company with children and celebrating an important event, they were friendly.
There was no fiery delivery from the plateau, the children waited.
You can safely go for good cuisine.
