Diego Cocca is the new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca is taking over from Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the position until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused unrest in the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs should encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) place the plant signs in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone.
The campaign "Geesthacht blüht auf" (Geesthacht is blooming) also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht is blooming" is an action of the Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from clubs, schools, kindergartens, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted in the ground since 2015. Goal: Large-scale flowering islands are to arise in the Geesthacht city area, on which insects can find food at any time. "With favorable weather conditions, the bees are already flying out in January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from the Geesthacht Nabu. He has beehives on his property himself.
So that this undertaking does not remain just an action of nature conservationists and the city's environmental department, but rather spreads far and wide into private gardens, explanatory plaques about the plants are set up again and again. There are about 50 signs so far. Passers-by should be able to find out this way what is currently blooming so beautifully. The hope is that amateur gardeners at home will deliberately replant.
In the first week of January, the wild hazel was already in season
More recent additions are shrubs such as Winter Sweet and Snowball in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been in the soil of the pots on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, and are just showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink. They have recently been marked with additional signs. "The Winter Sweet Shrub is a very bushy shrub and can grow up to two metres high and three metres wide," it says there, among other things, about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes, however, that it is not only the bedding plants that are now showing flowers. In the first week of January, the wild blackthorn had already started its season. It blossoms particularly abundantly on the Richtweg on the ascent, in the Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and in many nooks and crannies.
Ernestine is 102 years old: “Hiking keeps me young”
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of them if he looked down from heaven to Munich's Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there at 3 p.m. in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" for a lively step dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, sorry, young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native Munich (January 15, 1921) from Schwanthalerhöhe, Monday is the highlight of the week. "Dancing and stepping is my life, without it I can't imagine myself."
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also dancing with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thüringen) in 1926. She was a soubrette, which today would be called a musical performer, and worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I have spent my life dancing, acting and singing."
With her 79 years, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the circle of the stepp dancers. She says: "We just have fun with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: The tap dance was developed in the 19th century in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, which are more durable than the initially used wooden soles, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced during the dance, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is tap dance and the French claquettes. The Spanish flamenco could have influenced the tap dance. In this case, the tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a well audible tone during the dance.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the heart and soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family. We welcome people of all ages and sizes."
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Movement keeps me young," says the 102-year-old to BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy food and no alcohol."
Analog in the Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
As digitalisation progresses, many people are rediscovering the joys of the analogue world
The speed with which our everyday life has become digital has left us hardly any time to establish rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. In 1985, if you wanted to have a telephone conversation in Bautzen, you had three options. Either you were one of the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you belonged to those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could telephone the relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you looked for a telephone booth. The smell of the plastic receiver and the clicking of the small change in the vending machine are unforgettable. My biggest dream was to be able to see the face of the other person when making a call - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldavia) the President Maia Sandu has commissioned the former Minister of the Interior Dorin Recean with the formation of the government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. Until now, Recean was one of the president's advisors.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for their "enormous sacrifice".
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. The inflation rate is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 of the 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet is therefore not expected to be a problem.
However, pro-European politicians in Moldova have lost popularity in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023, Veitshöchheim will celebrate in style again. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities did not have to be asked twice.
Minister-President Markus Söder did not come as Moses, as suggested by his costume. He sees himself more as the tribal elder of Bavaria. By his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister for the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, chose the children's hero Chase from Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franconia came Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich with his wife Anja.
Completely detached: Minister for Science and Art, Markus Blume, is drawn into space.
The President of the State Parliament, Ilse Aigner, chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as a role model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's Health Minister Klaus Holetschek with his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder alias Building Minister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff at carnival: Bavaria's Minister of the Interior Joachim Herrmann, with his wife Gerswid.
At the Walz: Economic Minister Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to the trade with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, District Administrator of the Regensburg district, does the same.
The political opposition, of course, was also not to be missed.
Everything for Bavaria: Green party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
The SPD faction leader enjoys hiking: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
Royal got it from FDP faction leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he would certainly speak more. In Veitshöchheim, the chairman of the parliamentary group in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on his way as a pantomime.
If it doesn't work out with politics, he can still perform magic. Nuremberg's mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.
Fast as a bee on the move: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of the BR, Eva Majuntke, BR Director General Katja Wildermuth and BR Culture Programme Director Björn Wilhelm.
A small dig at the climate activists from the Franconian Tatort detective Sebastian Fleischer, played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The First Mayor of Veitshöchheim was of course also present. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in the World Championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and is closing in on his countryman Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even heavy fog did not prevent the long-term winner Bö from collecting his second gold at the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, it had already led to successful title defense with Norway's mixed relay team.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the hunting race. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, so that he can compensate for shooting errors to a certain extent in a frighteningly easy way.
With Doll, meanwhile, nothing was coming together again. After the veteran had given up all chances of a medal at the start with a penalty round in the mixed relay and had only taken sixth place, things did not go any better three days later. Three penalty rounds already in prone shooting and two more standing were a great disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
Six years ago, in Hochfilzen, he won surprisingly with a lead of 0.7 seconds, just barely ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career successes of Dolls, who so far has only once been on the podium this winter. The eighth place finisher from the Olympics in Beijing left without saying a word after his weak performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees made it to the 19th place, and the second World Cup debutant, David Zobel, finished in 35th place.
Biden receives Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
At a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the focus is on the value of democracy, with both looking back to their predecessors.
During a visit to his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, US President Joe Biden stressed the importance of maintaining democratic values.
“The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test,” said Biden on Friday in the White House in Washington. “We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength.” Looking at his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, Lula replied: “Brazil has isolated itself for four years.”
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed over Bolsonaro in a run-off election at the end of October. Lula took office on 1 January. The change of power was accompanied by serious riots. Bolsonaro’s supporters had stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court and the government headquarters in the capital city of Brasilia in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a dark reminder of the storming of the US Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump about two years ago, when they violently broke into the parliament in Washington.
Lula criticized Bolsonaro openly at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor had not given much thought to international relations. “His world began and ended with fake news, in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening”, said Lula. “That sounds familiar to me”, replied Biden – an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Short note about the press - Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? They showed the members of the Red Army Faction who were to be denounced and executed.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which already existed before Corona, public opinion was created against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say the bourgeois democracy, let's say the late capitalist society. (Here nothing about the really dangerous ones in pin-striped suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually behind Raudis in the S-Bahnen or masturbators in the park, publishes a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so nice, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there are probably more "Russian friends" in this world that Asia, Africa and Latin America that the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not what it's about, but: Ms. Wagenknecht is in 1st to 5th place (!), then follows Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my area who reads this paper anymore, if they do, it's high time they did. We've reached the well-known level where there's nothing left underneath.
And now, good dialectically, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all the people who are not yet completely dumbed down, i.e. peace-loving, pacifistic and anti-militaristic people. (And here no differentiation is needed anymore.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his partner Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL with the same wording: "I can confirm that my client has filed an application to dissolve his registered partnership with his family lawyer at the competent court. I will not comment on the details."
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth had been together for 35 years, and there had been rumors of a separation for about a year. According to various media reports, the fashion designer had already moved from their shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin after his participation in the jungle camp. In the RTL show, he also spoke about marriage problems.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, the ruins of which have been preserved, a memorial center was established in 1999. France's President Emmanuel Macron had awarded Hébras with the national order of merit a year ago. Hébras had fought for freedom and defended the values of France, Macron said. In addition, he had contributed to the German-French peace. The survivor had campaigned, among other things, for German-French youth encounters.
A bend for 14 houses: In Homeien, everyone knows everyone
LZ series Nordlippische Weiler: Not infrequently, three or four generations live under one roof in Homeien. Here, the residents find pure idyll. In the summer, up to 300 motorcycles per day race along the winding road between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even race back again.
Christian Sewing, CEO of Deutsche Bank, considers further interest rate hikes in the fight against the high inflation rate to be “absolutely” necessary. “The inflationary risks are still high. The costs for energy can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also give prices a temporary boost”, said Sewing to the “Welt am Sonntag”.
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the eurozone for the fifth time in a row and announced another increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The key interest rate in the eurozone is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive, which can dampen demand and thus counteract high rates of inflation. At the same time, higher loan interest rates can lead to postponed investments and thus weaker economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted eurozone countries such as Italy. “The consequences of sustained high inflation are far more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries,” said Sewing. “Of course, we have to keep this in mind, but high levels of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently.”
The ECB is aiming for medium-term price stability in the eurozone with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been a long way off for months. In January, the price increase weakened again, but consumer prices in the monetary area of the now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent above the level of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can afford less for a euro. Strongly increased energy prices, which significantly drive inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will “decline sooner or later”, warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). “I currently see this as the greatest danger for the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario.”
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany speed" called for by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) in infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and societal dialogue about it. And it will perhaps also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a regulatory framework will emerge, with which it will not necessarily have to go as fast as with the LNG terminals put into operation around the turn of the year - but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction time, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) had been opened. The aim was to close the gap in the gas supply to some extent due to the lack of Russian gas deliveries. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken of a new “Germany speed” on this occasion. In addition, the Federal Government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it comes down to it. But that should not automatically mean that we always act so categorically from now on and, for example, put a windmill in the neighbor's garden against his will," said Hartung. Therefore, there must still be a negotiation process about what is right and wrong as a society.
In the past, attempts have been made to use the classic rule book and it has not worked. "We should think again about whether our previous approach was the right one. Perhaps we have overdone it with the rule book and made it too complicated for ourselves".
In view of the many unresolved issues, such as the expansion of power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung. "As a consumer of this energy, I need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Trade union warns of the break-up of the Bayer Group
The Chemical Workers’ Union (IG BCE) has warned of a break-up of the company following an announcement of a change in leadership at Bayer. “From the perspective of employees, Bayer, with its three pillars, is perfectly positioned to meet the challenges of the future,” said Francesco Grioli, a member of the union’s executive board and a member of Bayer’s supervisory board, to the “Rheinische Post” (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the Consumer Health business with non-prescription drugs and the agricultural business. “The transformation of the industry can only be mastered with a corporate policy that is based on risk diversification and sustainability – and not on hedge fund activism”.
The background to this is the change at the top of the pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals group announced on Thursday. The controversial CEO Werner Baumann will be stepping down from his post later this summer. Taking over at the beginning of June will be Bill Anderson, the former CEO of Swiss rival Roche.
Baumann has been under fire for a long time. The 2018 acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for $63 billion is hanging over the manager's head. With the purchase, Bayer had expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the herbicide glyphosate. The Bayer share has been on a downward trend for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to grant discharge to the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann does not want to extend his contract, which was actually due to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors had put pressure on him. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital have also been involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for the company to be split up.
The very small fund with an unknown level of participation in Bayer is known for an aggressive approach. A spin-off “of the Consumer Health sector would be a possible way to increase the company’s value”, said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, to the “Rheinische Post”. He does not believe, however, that a spin-off of the much larger agricultural sector, Crop Science, is feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
Also on Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The unions are opposing the government's plans with massive protests on the streets. Hundreds of thousands of people want to demonstrate against the pension reform again on Saturday.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are once again expected to demonstrate nationwide on Saturday against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, the unions are mobilizing against the plans of the center-right government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, over a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted at protests. There has been a turbulent debate about the controversial reform in parliament for a week.
Already now, many people in France work longer than until the age of 62, if they have not paid in long enough for a pension free of deductions when they reach retirement age. In many demanding professions, people could hardly work any longer, according to the opponents of the reform. In addition, employees want to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not completely wear out their health at work.
Macron: Threatening deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, the employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order to keep the level of the pension stable, the population would have to work a little longer. The critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state should find other sources of income in order to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government wants to tighten not only the retirement age. The increase in the necessary contribution period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professions are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to around 1,200 euros.
The pension reform is considered to be one of the most important projects of President Macron. During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was abandoned, even then there were massive protests and strikes. Already several presidents before Macron tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protests and strikes were certain for all of them.
Since Macron’s camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced their support. Some of the deputies, however – even from Macron’s own party – still have reservations. And greater than the fear of a close vote at the moment is Macron’s concern about paralyzing strikes. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organizers to act responsibly, so that they would be peaceful and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather expected - a lot of sunshine in the highlands
A powerful high-pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that we can expect lots of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach am Main
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Although this high moves a little to the east in the course of the next week, it still determines the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite nasty and give the people in the lowlands gloomy high-level fog for days on end, while there is pure sunshine in the highlands of the Central Uplands".
In most regions, Sunday will start in a hazy-misty way. According to the DWD, it can also rain in the Erzgebirge and the Thüringer Wald up to Lower Bavaria. In the Alpine region, but also in the southwest and in parts of the west, the cloud cover will lift during the day and the sun will appear more frequently. In the rest of the country, it will remain heavily overcast or covered in a high-level fog. The temperatures will reach 4 to 9 degrees Celsius, around 10 degrees Celsius in the Rhine area.
"On Monday, the sun, which is gradually becoming stronger, will nibble away at the high-level fog again and can dissolve it more and more over the course of the day," says the meteorologist. Sunshine is expected throughout the day on the edge of the Alps, in the uplands of the Central Uplands and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia. Elsewhere, the sun has to fight its way through the high-level fog. The maximum temperatures are between 5 and 9 degrees, around 11 degrees are expected in the Lower Rhine region, and only around 3 degrees in the southeast, where it is always grey. A weak wind is blowing from different directions.
On Tuesday, in some low-lying areas, there may only be a slow clearing of fog or thick fog. Otherwise, after the fog clears, the weather will be sunny. In the highlands, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps, the sun is expected to shine all day, according to the forecast. Temperatures will rise to between 5 and 11 degrees Celsius, depending on the amount of sunshine.
Dominatorin grumbles: Again no World Championship medal for Goggia
The favourite Sofia Goggia, who was knocked out in the downhill of the Alpine Ski World Championships, was severely disappointed.
Méribel
"I am sad because I did not deliver the performance that I can," said the Italian on ZDF, after she had set up a goal and was eliminated. Nonetheless, the 30-year-old was able to prevent a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill racer in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six season races in this discipline. After winning gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won silver at the Olympic Winter Games 2022 in Beijing. Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, still has to wait for a World Championship medal in her favorite discipline. At her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago, she was absent due to injury.
"I actually thought I was doing well. It was about hundredths of a second," said Goggia after the surprising victory of Swiss skier Jasmine Flury in Méribel in France. "I am disappointed. I gave it my all. But that's life." Sometimes you believe things are guaranteed, she said about the medal that was expected by all experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not."
Missing girls in Berlin: Who has seen Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since 10 February.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at the S-Bahnhof Waidmannslust.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the public for help in the search for a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school together with other children in the direction of the Waidmannslust S-Bahnhof on 10 February 2023 at around 12:30. She was last seen there at the S-Bahnhof. The child has been a refugee in Berlin since April 2022 and has only very limited knowledge of the German language and the local area.

Selenskyj and ministers against Russia's participation in the Olympics
Kiev. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
At a joint telephone conference, it was agreed to draw up a statement in order to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sporting competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sport announced on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation had taken place on the initiative of Great Britain. It had been a very productive meeting, wrote the British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. “And I made the position of Great Britain very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus should not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this topic”.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. "While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," said Zelenskyy. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. In the end, a neutral flag is also stained with blood and cannot be worn because of the Russian war of aggression.
Ukraine threatens with a boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a party to the war, because the country makes military bases available to the Russian troops for attacks. Selenskyj called on the officials to fight for the protection of the Olympic principles and to prevent the admission of Russian female and male athletes to the competitions. The President also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has unfortunately lost its “honesty”.
The reason for the conference was the announcement by the IOC that it wanted to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes to participate.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sport, stated in response that it had also reaffirmed during the consultations that it would refuse to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to start in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sport to return to competition. Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's attempt to readmit Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way," a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior said in response to a dpa inquiry.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics must be kept separate.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is striving for a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly declare their commitment to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently stated that an exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violates the ban on discrimination.
Pointing the finger where it happens
"Hey, sexy butt!", whistling at the idiot in the tight sexy costume and shouting lewd comments: All of this falls under the term "Catcalling". Behind the term lies nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost? USA sees Moscow's tank stocks heavily depleted
Half of the vehicles lost? USA sees Moscow's tank stocks heavily depleted
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a considerable number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. The talk is of "half of the main stock".
According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or confiscated" by Ukraine, said Celeste Wallander, Secretary of State for International Security Issues in the US Department of Defense.
At an online event of the think tank Center for a New American Security, Wallander did not provide further details on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Great Britain has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger-2 battle tanks for March. Germany wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 battle tanks to Ukraine in a coalition with other states by April. The USA has also promised a battalion of 31 battle tanks of the Abrams type. However, their delivery is expected to take much longer.
Russia wants to catch up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev promised to build and modernize thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has been begging for planes, missiles, tanks," Medvedev said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that it is self-evident for us in this case to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology - including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that makes it possible to better align the economy with the needs of the army. As a result, individual industries can be required to supply the armed forces.
Turmoil over the filling of positions in the army
Because the post that the former director of the Army History Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future was not advertised. The personnel representative of the Academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the procedure.
An invitation to tender is not necessary because the appointment is for an unoccupied post, said the minister. "I do not want to comment on the speculations of a liberal personnel representative," she said. Ortner was replaced at the head of the HGM last year after 17 years. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was faced with serious accusations of mobbing. These accusations have been cleared up in Tanner's view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts the suitability of Ortner in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ is demanding that Tanner clarify the "unusual appointment process". The decision was tainted by the "appearance of nepotism", says SPÖ defence spokesperson Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in the corruption quagmire", said Douglas Hoyos, spokesperson for state defence. He announced a parliamentary inquiry into the matter.
Carnival: First fools go to their knees because of costs
Unlike the state capital, Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs for security, among other things, are difficult to manage in Wasungen, says carnival president Marcel Kißling. The funds alone for this make up about half of the calculated total costs for the parade.
In Brandenburg, no carnival parades will take place. The "Parade of the Merry People" in Cottbus, which is probably once again the largest in East Germany, will take place for the first time after the pandemic. No parades have been cancelled for the Swabian-Alemannic carnival either.
Despite the increased costs, Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade. "We're going ahead with our event," says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claußen. But even here, financial worries are being felt: If more sponsors aren't found, or if the existing ones don't contribute more, reserves will have to be tapped - "that's not possible every year." The current deficit: approximately 200,000 euros.
And inflation: With sweets, there is a price increase of up to 60 percent in some cases, says Elvira Reuther from the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. Due to luck in misfortune, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already certain that it will be more expensive for the parade. Twice as much personnel will be required for security as in 2020.
If you stand by the roadside during the carnival parade in the Rhineland on Shrove Monday, you might get fewer sweets than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some parade participants do not have as many sweets with them. Sweets or not, the crowds of visitors are likely to be large: "I believe that if it does not rain buckets on that day, then we can certainly expect an increased number of visitors," says Holger Kirsch, the carnival leader in Cologne. "This is due to the fact that two years ago there was no regular carnival parade. The parade cannot be replaced by anything."
The organizing committee in Cologne is not commenting in detail on the costs. However, the train is generally "deficitary", which is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and homemade vodka
The Ukrainians are not for nothing known as heavy drinkers. There is domestic beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then I discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't detect any major difference in taste. The same applies to vodka, which is widely available. They mainly distill it in the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see for yourself how little you can trust the Russians. It is said that as a tourist, you should be careful with it. But that only applies if you go to the massive sales. Then it is probably also watered down.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for the high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Food and drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or have a beer at the end of the day, Rostock and Warnemünde have great places for that. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or warming up before club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President sees favourite victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender will be greeted at the arena by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the awarding of medals in the World Championship sprint in Oberhof. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was impossible to tell from the VIP stand on Saturday whether the panes of glass at the shooting range had really fallen. "I had to get the results on my mobile phone," said Frank-Walter Steinmeier with a grin, and referred to the ever-recurring fog drifting into the stadium, which severely impaired the view of the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, and received numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by biathlon," he revealed, and praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The newly renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes also say so - with thanks to those who have been working here since the World Championships were awarded." In terms of sustainability, the location is now "a step ahead" of many others, and thus "secure for the next few years and even decades."
Once again, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö got away from the competition in a sporting way. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured the sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second world championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his brother Tarjei, who shot without errors (14.8 seconds behind) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory.
The local ski hunters could not get involved in the battle for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wicks triumph. Johannes Kühn, after a shooting error and with a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes, finished in eighth place as the best German. WM-debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and became twelfth (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the gray veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed entry on Wednesday, the Black Forest dweller this time left five targets standing and disappeared as the 55th, deeply disappointed and without comment, in the dressing room.
Bö went into the race with number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and manifested this status despite the complicated viewing conditions. However: In his last two standing shots, he had the luck of the skilled; they both landed on the edge of the discs and still fell. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year-older brother: "It is the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is hardly any doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. In contrast, the German hopes rest with Herrmann-Wick. "If you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in as tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one," Sport Director Felix Bitterling took his "locomotive" to task. The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 p.m. and 3:30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych displeased with "bee swarm" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on the referee ball.
Aggressive players or grumbling coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanlike conduct. Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model function.
German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative trends in the way players interact on the pitch. "I think there are new behaviours from the players, who surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old to the German Press Agency. "We discussed this in the winter break. We decided that we do not want to accept such unsporting behaviour. We will pay more attention to this in the future and will also sanction it."
Lastly, two coaches were also sent off. The Mainz coach, Bo Svensson, was shown the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. Christian Streich, the coach of Freiburg, was sent off with a yellow card for the league defeat in Dortmund. "The behaviour of the coaches also falls into the category of unsporting behaviour. We noticed that unsporting behaviour has also increased in this area, that the behaviour towards referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to punish such unsporting behaviour consistently," said Brych.
DFB referee chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a fundamentally good cooperation between coaches and referees. "Overall, the relationship fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The affected person must then live with that. That shouldn't be anything world-changing," said Fröhlich to the German Press Agency.
"From the emotionality, conflicts can arise in the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into a personal defamation, then one must also accept that the corresponding measures are taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In the recent cases, the participants cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if a rethinking process as a whole could be set in motion, so that such behavior is simply not tolerated," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sport Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible effects on a different level. "Of course, incidents from professional football always have an impact. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have reacted consistently to negative behavior," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combined Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro after a jump from the normal hill and the 10-kilometre long cross-country ski race, ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third place went to Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German Nordic combined team is not at full strength in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. They are preparing themselves with training in Oberstdorf for the World Championships, which will take place from 21 February to 5 March in the Slovenian Planica. "We have three world-class athletes at home. The team naturally feels that," said team coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven lightly injured after a collision on the A5
Seven people, including two children, were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on the A5 motorway near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis). According to a police statement, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a motorist hit a car from behind during a slight traffic jam and pushed it into two other cars. The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marl Sculpture Museum
Have brought the exhibition to life: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his wall painting.
On Sunday, 12 February, an unusual exhibition will come to an end in the Marl Sculpture Museum. There will be some extras for the finale.
The finissage of the exhibition "Wandgebunden" will take place on Sunday, 12 February, at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarters of the Marl Sculpture Museum in Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format wall paintings attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted over and the artworks will disappear. However, a catalogue will document the works created specifically for the Marl Museum. It will be presented by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag on 12 February.
For the Finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community. Using numerous image examples, she will present the special features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and ask about the connections to this art form in the Federal Republic, with a focus on NRW from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator. In 2013, she completed her doctoral thesis on the wall paintings of the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching architectural art as well as the history of art and institutions in post-war Germany. Most recently, she has been working with Sebastian Freytag on architectural art in North Rhine-Westphalia. After the lecture, the final guided tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists will be present.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have favored the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In the south of Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued after building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, around 33 people have been issued arrest warrants, reported the state news agency Anadolu on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in the collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the accused was reportedly arrested at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have attempted to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in pre-trial detention, according to Anadolu. Nine other people were reportedly arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 shook the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 in the afternoon. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Former East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow has died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the Left parliamentary group in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old died in the night to Saturday. Fraktionsvorsitzende Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left politician as a “deeply sincere socialist”.
“Hans Modrow passed away last night at the age of 95,” the left-wing faction in the German parliament announced on Saturday. The party is losing “a significant personality,” explained the faction leader Dietmar Bartsch and the former faction leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As prime minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the wall, on November 13, 1989, he became the chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for around 150 days. In the Volkskammer elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was succeeded as the last prime minister of the GDR until reunification by the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The Chairman of the Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the microblogging service Twitter as a “deeply sincere and combative socialist”. Bartsch added:
"Right up to his old age, he was an important advisor in our party, and his wisdom will be missed."
"The entire peaceful course of the creation of German unity was precisely a special merit of his. That will remain his political legacy," wrote Bartsch and Gysi in their obituary.
"His later work in the Volkskammer, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted in representing also that part of the former population of the GDR that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated".
After reunification, Modrow sat in the German Bundestag for the PDS from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state "quite critically." German unity was accomplished too quickly, the GDR was swallowed up too unconditionally, and it was condemned too one-sidedly as an "unlawful state," Modrow criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened in the night
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned Russian rocket attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev has to carry out repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian rocket attacks is forcing new repairs to the Ukrainian energy grid. However, Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, said the head of the energy supplier Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. The power supply situation is particularly bad in the Charkiv region. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Chmelnyzkyi nuclear power plant, and production had to be curtailed at the Riwne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the Russian attack with about 100 rockets and cruise missiles on Friday as terror. In a video message, however, he reported to his countrymen how much support Ukraine received on his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj does not want to leave the small town of Bachmut in the lurch
On February 24, war will have been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to Poland, an important supporter of Ukraine, shortly before the anniversary. The danger from Russian missile attacks, however, continued into the night before Saturday. In the capital Kiev, air raid alarms were sounded for the fifth time that day late on Friday evening. "An attack with drones is imminent," said the military administration of the Kiev region. Combat drones of Iranian design were also spotted and shot down over the regions of Mykolajiw and Odessa in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: The Federal Government has chosen consultants for the network company
Demands from, among others, the FDP and the Greens from the election campaign to split it off failed due to the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, the compromise of an infrastructure company was agreed upon, which, however, should be geared towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not need to generate profits and distribute them.
Repair backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government monitor this process. The backlog of repairs to the rail network is a major reason why Deutsche Bahn is currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has made it his mission to rectify this situation with the complete renovation of entire railway corridors. The investments required for this are currently estimated at 50 billion euros, but according to more recent calculations by Deutsche Bahn, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
Apparently, the external circumstances did not work in Herrmann-Wick's favour. She had slept badly, she told us after the race, was "totally agitated", her pulse had not returned to normal even when she entered the stadium. "A race like this", and at the home World Championships, "you can't describe it with words", she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the pounding schlager music with German flags, coaches and team members fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoying biathlon", that was what she had set out to do
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope outside of the relay teams. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter. In the overall World Cup, she is currently in fifth place. And even if the performance density among the women is significantly higher at the top than among the men, where Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians are currently dominating, Herrmann-Wick was not one of the favourites for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018. At that time, demonstrators who demanded the resignation of Ortega took refuge in churches. More than 350 people died in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often out of fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiring with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry demands more orders from the special fund
The first armaments projects have therefore already been cancelled, and further projects are threatened with the same fate, as the "Welt am Sonntag" reports. Which investments will actually be cancelled cannot be said at the moment. "There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this point in time," says a response from the federal government to a question from the member of parliament Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment sum is the rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which the Bundestag had decided in June 2022, has to bear the interest burden for the loans itself. If these rise, there is therefore less money available for the specific acquisitions for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the current high inflation reduces the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 1:40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from Kupferzell, wanted to turn left at the Kupferzell motorway entrance onto the motorway in the direction of Heilbronn. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver was driving on the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, as the police reported. During the turning maneuver of the BMW driver, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the accident site showed "green" for them. A check of the traffic light system revealed no problems. Further investigations will follow. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were all slightly injured in the accident. They had to be taken to a hospital. The two cars suffered a total of approximately 20,000 euros in damage.
Schlossplatz Stuttgart remembers the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many people in Stuttgart followed the call of the Ditib mosque community in Feuerbach on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake catastrophe in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
The earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria is preoccupying the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people gathered on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz to remember the victims and pray for them.
Many members of the congregation followed the call of the Firebacher Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the prayer of the imam seriously and in silence. In the prayer, the imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could also overcome this catastrophe. He asked, among other things, for health, protection from plagues and for respectful treatment of one another. The congregation also asked for assistance and strength "to bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands by the side of the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for the victims and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The prayers were also translated into German on the Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region is great. The donation campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in Glockenstraße over several days, which are to be brought to the earthquake regions by truck. Even there, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hiking with meat filling - Ebersberg
"After eating, you should rest or do a thousand steps".... The older generation knows the proverb, the younger generation simply puts it into practice. In any case, in the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unprecedented renaissance. Because who, thanks to home office, is not sitting in the middle of a stone desert, but rather only a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, now uses the lunch break either after the quick snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk in the fresh air. At least that's the impression you get around the Egglburger See, where between 12 and 2 pm not only dog owners are hanging out.
One reason could of course be that people in modern times, in the course of optimal use of time slots, can associate the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things. After all, why not use a short walk through nature to get news from the settlement from the neighbor who hasn't been seen for a long time? Or to meet a friend with whom one never manages to get to the cinema, not even to the Alte Kino? In this way, work and private life can also be combined - who says that the appointment with the tax consultant, lawyer or investment advisor can't take place outdoors? As long as there are no foreign ears in the vicinity, of course.
What you can also do very well is to acquire trinkets. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands next to a cheese plate on a table by the side of the road. Or potatoes and meat. It's just a shame if you haven't already thought about the purchase and made the appropriate arrangements beforehand. So an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and with regret in their voice: "Too bad, we forgot the money."
One can sympathize with the disappointment, even though one has a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. What one also lets the sympathetic casual acquaintance know. To which the man responds: "That's not true! You do have a bag with you!" And he points to the hood of the jacket, which one quickly put on before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an additional head covering unnecessary. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that one sets out on the return journey with a meat dish, and on this midday excursion, one not only comes back with a lamb loin, but also with a very practical idea. It is quite possible that on this day, a second walk will take place - after dinner. This time, it will actually be for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the Kreisstraße in the direction of Hailfingen and, for reasons that are still unclear, went off the road to the right in a left-hand bend, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a guide post, collided sideways with a tree and came to a stop a few meters away. The driver was trapped in his car as a result of the collision. The fire department freed him with heavy equipment. The rescue service took the seriously injured man to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of inability to drive, a blood sample was taken. According to the police report, the Audi was a total write-off with a value of 1,000 euros.
Donald Trump’s tax returns: A victory for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided: The financial authority must hand over the tax returns of the former president to parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in office as President of the USA
The Treasury Department must order the tax authority IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, it said in the Ministry's decision on Friday.
Contrary to political customs in the USA, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax returns public either as a candidate or later as president. He fought against their release all the way to the Supreme Court. A prosecutor's office in New York has now received the documents, but no details may be made public from them - unless there is a trial.
The release to Congress is probably more sensitive for Trump: There, the circle of those authorized to access the information is somewhat larger and, under certain conditions, individual details could be released during the course of the committee’s investigation. In addition, confidential information is always leaking out of Congress.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as president," Pelosi explained.
Cabaret in the Bastion: Life plays between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract from the many offers? Stay or leave? Either - or? As slaves of time, people today rush from one appointment to the next and sometimes push people and hamburgers in between. Lucy van Kuhl shows in her new program that the "in-between" state has something exciting.
In a humorous and thought-provoking way, Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about situations from life. In her sensitive chansons and snappy cabaret songs, she hits the nail on the head - and some things are also between the lines. The show starts on Saturday, February 18, at 8.30 p.m. in the Kirchheim club Bastion.
British serious criminal caught after a long flight in Thailand
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug dealer from Great Britain has been caught in Thailand. As the British National Crime Agency (NCA) announced on Saturday, the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police in a car workshop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the “Most Wanted” list of the criminals most wanted by the NCA.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group fled at the beginning of 2018 before the start of a trial in which he was sentenced to eleven years in prison in absentia for attempting to import amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Encounters at the church table
Bielefeld
What is put on the table remains a secret beforehand, because the people should primarily come to the Vesperkirche to meet others, not because something specific is on the menu. On this Sunday it starts, then the Neustadt Marienkirche will be the dining room for two weeks.
Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, according to his own statement, loves the Viennese sense of humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo, "Make Science Great Again", fits in well with this. Whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic skepticism about science is open to question. His humor, however, fits in very well in Vienna.
The English-language title, by the way, is also derived from Ebert's more recent life story. In 2019, he tried to make a name for himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year. But now he's back and he's telling his German-speaking audience not only about his experiences abroad, but he's also explaining what Wissenaft actually is and what it can do - and what it can't do. Of course, Corona comes up, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering skills.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many shy away from: What is really important? All of this with a huge wink, unpretentious and very ironic. And so you are not only well entertained, but can also learn something from it.
Please go for typing... it doesn't take long, it doesn't hurt and it can save many people's lives.
My phone rings with an unknown number. I pick it up. This woman is the honest finder of her wallet.
The Nordcon team writes further: "In contrast to our old location, we only have very few stairs.
MdB Pfeiffer describes climate protection as a replacement religion. May even be true, because I love this planet and its civilization more than any abstract God
Ten firefighters and two policemen were partly seriously injured in the explosion.
I can dismiss it all as harmless eccentricity. You don't do things like that to children.
It's good that for decades the city politics have acknowledged the advantages and never questioned them.
On Monday, May 15 at 6:00 p.m., the Solidary Church, the Peace Panel and the Evangelical City Academy invite you to a lecture and discussion event at the Evangelical College on the topic of "Peace and Security in the Time of Change?"
I really don't understand why they don't hold such events on Sundays, or in the city.
What is the #Railway actually doing to annoy customers and ruin its image even further!?
Brilliant how well #LuisaNeubauer puts it to the point. We need exactly such people. Thank you Luisa!
Microtransactions in Diablo IV: Blizzard names details and prices of monetization <URL> #DiabloIV #ActivisionBlizzard
After the political crisis and new elections in 2020, politicians of all colours are travelling to Germany together for the first time (!).
I am curious who I will meet and who I will get to know there;-)
Party colleague Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer eleven, just like the Ministry of Education under Anja Karliczek, she is also a CDU minister.
So this is really nothing new, this is the case with every electronic ticket. Check-in/check-out is a different house number.

1. General provisions
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle action from the viewpoint of a tank driver. The battles take place in a wide valley, which is completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley basin there are tuff pyramids and tuff blocks, which offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy fire.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving chain vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble rockets, which, during the extended game sequence, become increasingly difficult to hit. In addition, UFOs appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player's tank, but the player can achieve a high score by being hit by a UFO. The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction sequence, the game introduction sequence, the game sequence, the initialization input for maximum results, and the self-test sequence. The latter operating mode represents a special sequence for checking the operating elements and the computer function.
4. Course of the game
Gameplay is initiated when the push-button switch START is activated. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds can be heard. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, the game is over. The game begins with slow moving tanks that appear on the screen. The position of the enemy tanks or rockets can be determined by the player by paying attention to the displayed text in the upper left corner of the cockpit's information display. For example, the displayed text might read: ENEMY FROM THE RIGHT. Additionally, a point representing the enemy position appears on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound.
The upper, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player's field of vision on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he can be easily targeted on the screen. At the same time, the message OPPONENT IN FIRE AREA is displayed in the upper left corner of the display.
For a short time, UFOs appear on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless missiles that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the opponent or the player tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by the radar. The UFOs are intended to round out the battle and distract the player, since they normally appear at the same time as enemy tanks or rockets. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player tank and the opponent tank. A hit by the player earns 5,000 points. If the opponent is hit, the following points are earned: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a rocket, and 3,000 points for a supertank. A supertank moves and turns twice as fast as the player tank or a slow-moving opponent tank. Several possibilities give the setter the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4, or even 5 tanks for a game sequence. In addition, a bonus tank can be released after reaching predetermined point values, and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a further, more difficult game sequence. Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector for this setting option can be found in the illustration.
5. Initial input with maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum point total in the High Score Table, he or she may enter three (3) personal initials into the table at the end of the game. Instructions for doing so are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Note that when a self-test is initiated, the RESET button is pushed on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, or power is interrupted, the High Score Table is erased. Upon erasure (RESET), the ten (10) highest point totals with their initials are retained and re-entered on the screen to challenge additional players. Any point total over 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically enter dashes. Thereafter, the unit will revert to the Attraction game play. CONSTRUCTION DETAILS
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with video devices from ATARI, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI control lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing parts, which makes this unit more stable and ensures proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, always brings the control lever back into the center position. The micro switches are now attached with self-locking nuts for easier exchange. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y game circuit has been expanded to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the analog vector generator board and the auxiliary board. With the help of this switching technique, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a uniform and smooth image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply given by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash box with a larger coin acceptance capacity. Furthermore, a console is located in the device, which is intended as a podium for smaller players to make playing easier. At the same time, this console guarantees maximum device stability.
These new components, as well as all other major sub-assemblies of this unit, are shown in Figure 1. If any of these new parts are mentioned in this manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Equipment Inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should carry out a certain check to complete the quality control. In order to have the certainty that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V network yet. A. Examine the outside of the housing for damage. B. Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all cable harness plugs for a correct and firm connection.
NOTE: Never force a plug connection. The plugs are spring-loaded so that a correct connection is made. A 180-degree twisted plug connection will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the game PC board for correct and secure fit. (3) Check the manufacturing number of the device on the nameplate on the back of the device. Check that the stamped manufacturing number matches that of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, Auxiliary PC board, Control/Audio II PC board and the TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the manufacturing number is on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be given when you call your service dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, control console and TV monitor for correct assembly. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. With a glance through the player's viewing glass, check that the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange-circled opening in the cover. If the opening is not precisely centered, the cover, which is attached to the housing with adhesive tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before the device is connected to the mains supply, ensure that the voltage selector plug on the power supply unit 1 (see fig. 3) matches the local mains voltage. Check the colour of the cable on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Here are a number of tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games. Check your system configuration
Please take the time to check that your system meets the requirements listed on the packaging. You can use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool to get an overview of your system if you're not sure if your PC meets the requirements. Here's how to run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool: Click the Start button and choose the "Run" option. Type "dxdiag" into the text field. The DirectX Diagnostic Tool user interface will now appear. Here you can access all relevant system details, including information about your graphics and sound card. You can check whether graphics and sound are working correctly by clicking the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D, and DirectSound, among other things. Note: If you don't have advanced computer knowledge, we would advise against changing any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool. Before starting the game
Other programs may be using up system resources that the game needs to run smoothly. Not all of these programs are obvious that they are active, and many will start automatically when the system boots up. Such programs that are always active on your system are called "background applications." In some cases, they may be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. Therefore, we recommend that you close or deactivate such background applications before you start the game. Look for the program's icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and choose the appropriate option ("Deactivate," "Close," or similar). Once you have deactivated the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also close general background applications, as they sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to close all unnecessary background applications."
Before you install software, you need to make sure that your hard drive is working optimally. You should, therefore, make it a habit to clean up your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need for this are included with Windows: Use ScanDisk, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup to make sure everything runs smoothly. This will increase the chances that current games will run largely without problems on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, which means that other applications you use will also run faster and more stably. Consult the Windows Help files to learn more about the ScanDisk, Check Disk, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup tools. Using the Windows Help
1. Click the “Start” button and choose the “Help” (or “Help and Support”) option to call up the Windows Help. 2. Now click in the search field and enter the appropriate keyword, e. g. “ScanDisk” (Win 98/ME), “Check Disk” (Win 2000/XP), “Defragment” and “Disk Cleanup”. You will then receive instructions that explain how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First, try downloading the latest drivers from the website of the graphics card manufacturer. Here are the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS ON DRIVING ABILITY
The desire to develop video games was sparked in me by the emergence of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a multitude of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits. It represented for me an opportunity to explore new horizons. I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I struggled with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered - especially a new language, which was to be both narrative and visual. To be honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that video games only used a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities, because they were too much about "action" and forgot about one fundamental element of the human world of experience: feelings. Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true, emotion-conveying means of expression. Although this could of course have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that it is possible to create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting against abhorrent monsters in dark corridors and shooting boxes to get ammunition, but also has much more demanding and profound content. It is proof that one can tell a story and use the possibilities of the medium.
THE README FILE
There is a ReadMe file on the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM that contains the license agreement and updated information about the game. We recommend that you review this file so that you are aware of any changes that have been made since this manual was printed. To view the file, double-click on the Fahrenheit folder on your hard drive (usually C:\Programs\Atari\Fahrenheit). You can also access the ReadMe file by clicking on the Start button on the Windows® taskbar, selecting Programs, selecting Atari, selecting Fahrenheit, and finally selecting the ReadMe file.
SETUP AND INSTALLATION
1. Start Windows® 2000/XP. 2. Insert the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM into the DVD-ROM drive. 3. If the “AutoPlay” option is enabled, the title screen should appear. If “AutoPlay” is not enabled or the installation does not start automatically, click the Start button on the Windows® taskbar, and then click “Run.” Type D:\Setup, and then click “OK.” Note: If your DVD-ROM drive is assigned a letter other than “D,” use that letter instead. 4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation of the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM. 5. Once the installation is complete, click the Start button on the Windows® taskbar, and then click Programs/Atari/Fahrenheit/Fahrenheit to start the game. Note: The Fahrenheit DVD-ROM must be in the DVD-ROM drive for you to play the game.

Course of the game
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (with minimum credit 2) for 2 players. It is necessary to try to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The course of the game is set in such a way that a minimum prescribed area must be occupied before the next area (round) can be attacked. At the upper edge of the screen, the time-controlled SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. When there is an alarm, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, as long as you try to draw your territory, your marking sign gets into the death spiral, it will be destroyed, since you cannot cross your own path or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse is lit and your marking sign is destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At a slower drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is capable of self-testing, providing data, and demonstrating that circuits and controls are working properly. See "Service Program" for more information. The volume can be adjusted on the volume control (VOLUME) on the data/sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
For programming and testing, the 4 switches located in the device, the self-test button, and the LEDs on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. With this display, the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work is selected. With the help of the "Sub-Test" switch, the languages can be set. If the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" switch to switch to the next program display. Use display. With this display, the difficulty factor for the game can be determined. In addition, a "Maximum number of credits", which may be present before the start of the game, can be set. The text to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (appears green), the value desired for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch several times, the factory or basic setting can be reached, if the bottom line (RESET line) is green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (so called green lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can take place. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score Value x 10 000) is used to transfer the high score points to the next program display up to "High Score so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits that a player needs so that his own initials (names) and the hit points are entered on the screen. The "Maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, the game is ended.
"Threshold": height of the % number that has to be reached to switch to the next lap
"Time limit": Approval for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Difficulty level of the game
"Anziehton": no tone at "0" in standby mode
with "1" tone also with stationary operation (animated tone) "Table model": with "0" stationary device
with "1" table device
The credits per coin are set on the "Insert Coin Programming" display. High Score Program display (Highest score so far). The score points and initials of the player, including the next 10 score numbers, appear. The values are used to set the high score selected on the previous display (set to "back"). By pressing the "Up" button, the initials QIX Standard are set. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears. The "Total Evaluation". By pressing the "Up" button, it can be set to 0. The following values are recorded: Total Credit: The number of paid credits. The total number cannot be set to 0. If 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts over. The total number can only appear on 0 when the battery or the W1 connector is removed, with the device turned off. Left Coins: The number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Middle Coins: (not available) Right Coins: The number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Credits Paid: The number of credits paid for coins inserted. Credits Granted: The number of credits granted by the device. % Free Spins: Credits granted (Paid + Credits Granted per 100) Minutes Played: The number of minutes played. Minutes Won: The number of minutes won. Minutes Lost: The number of minutes lost.
High Score: The number of times a player has had enough high scores to displace other players from the high score list. Pressing the "Up" button resets the values to 0. Pressing the "Test" button brings up the next program display.
Loading slot programming/normal coin setting. This display can be used by the operator to select a standard coin setting or to program a different setting
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches, while the top digit lights up green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the default setting, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After a single press, the top setting digit is set to 0, which means that a custom setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his setting efforts by selecting a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that are not appropriate. Once the setting is made, any new setting to be made can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. In the event of an unwanted press, the default setting appears. The "Up" and "Down" switches can be used to increase or decrease the values. The "Test" switch ends the process. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") indicates how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an associated slot. Coin units - "credit" indicates the number of units required before a credit is issued. "Bonus" coin units indicates the number of units required before a bonus credit is issued. "Min.-coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. At the default setting, this value is set to 0. "Max.-coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a specified maximum amount of coins is reached. At the default setting, this value is set to 999.
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to the factory default settings. This condition indicates probable battery failure or malfunction.
ERROR CHECKING and SETTINGS
Start the testing method. Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LED's should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be inputted to the respective program display. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program is displayed. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the "Self-Test" button must be pressed twice so that the video test begins in the auto-test mode. With this program, the device will perform the hardware test continuously until it is turned off. If the display "Open Coin Door to Test" appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be inserted. With the J 19 plug pulled out, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM video test cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the unit stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is faulty, U10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decode plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the operational reliability of the memory, which is shared by two processors, by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the Gerät with the aforementioned display is held, a fault has been detected. If the Communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the fault may be due to a faulty wiring (RAM) or faults in the data board. In order to locate the fault, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. Failure means: faults in U 3, U 4 or associated power circuits.
Video board CMOS RAM
After values have been written into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the communication RAM. If the test has been passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device is holding the above display, an error is present. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predetermined patterns in the color RAM. These patterns will be checked for correctness when read back. LED Value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is a fault. Check U56, U57, and associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video Board (Display RAM). The Display RAM is tested by writing a pattern on each side. The results of these writes are compared to the original pattern. Any discrepancies cause the program to halt and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a Display RAM fails, diagnose the problem and replace the RAM. If this fault diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it indicates that the next test has begun (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and functional.
Unfortunately disappointing
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That is also the reason for star No. 1. The 2nd reason is that the right jacket arrived without recognizable seam defects. BUT I was probably too excited about this jacket, because the disappointment was all the greater. I had oriented myself on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it is supposed to fit so tightly and I did not want to struggle with an S or M in my upper body... In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and at the waist... I could swim in the rest. In addition, the lining material was already distributed all over the place when you opened the package. Simply a shame... It will be sent back: /
Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear it well from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears the 158 and the 36 fits her very well in this case and will probably still be worn next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I opted for the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the car jack and this is not optimal. Unfortunately, I misjudged and the support does not quite fit. But that is my fault. I then made a slight change so that it fits. The support looks very robust and you no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the entire surface. It worked without any problems. It does not slip anymore. I would buy it again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself I quite okay, but not under one year. Since the chewing surface is much too large for the small mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months old and he could not use it due to the size. Now at 12 months old we have looked for it again and he can use it. He has also not been able to bite anything with his already existing teeth. And if it was in the fridge, it calmed him down a lot.
Quality insufficient / Unfortunately decreasing
I allowed myself to be blinded by the sometimes exaggerated reviews. I would like to preface this by saying that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. A very large one (for storing equipment) and a rather small one for the most important, everyday things that you just happen to take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro is now finally too small for me and I need a replacement. During Prime Day, I bought this backpack for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews beforehand. When the backpack arrived yesterday, disappointment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, that cannot be said. But that it (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices.... People, that is simply not true! I had really hoped that it was so, but that cannot be the case at all. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro. The separations inside are of a completely different caliber, much more flimsy. Overall, the haptics of this backpack cannot be compared to those of my Lowepro. Also, the zippers for travel and the materials of the compartments for small items are not particularly high quality. Therefore, I have decided that the backpack will be returned. If I purchase equipment worth many thousands of EUR, then I unfortunately also have to spend the money on a decent backpack.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far, the electrical series by E. L. Todd had been my favorite, however, my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and I was really looking forward to the third part. In the part, Volt and Taylor's feelings are going on all the time and I found it unnecessary to be drawn out. Taylor has been daydreaming about Volt for so long, finally admits everything to himself and is then like a little child and withdraws?! At the same time, there were also inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt still tried to convince Taylor's ex and did not believe him when he said that Taylor would stand by him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor could not do without him and he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex-girlfriend. This would bring more tension into the story.
Man destroys everything, does not know how to appreciate anything and does not learn to do so! First of all: Sooo bad is the film now not, as many write. Of course, of course, the story is totally contrived, and always conceived according to the same pattern F. If you have seen the beginning, you know how the end is. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and does not know how to appreciate anything, and does not learn to do so! And that is exactly what the film wants to tell us! How often have I only thought at the film (and that although I know that it is only a film, and the animals come from the computer)! Oh my God, the poor animals, the film often makes me cry. Therefore, Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom is really well made. It is just a pity that man does not get the message behind the film, and that, although it is a mainstream film. We consistently destroy, the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and profit-seeking, and out of stupidity and arrogance! No empathy for the environment and the living beings: none. 4 stars, because the film is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been inside. Nevertheless, well made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some people expect a film like 8 Mile here. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be one. This film is above all "French". In addition, it is quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you let yourself be carried away by it and do not expect anything from it that it does not want to be.
Problematic
Taste like Quench from the 90s, so what about orange, but that doesn't matter either. 5 days every morning a pack: nothing has moved, but nothing at all. My waist circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! After that, diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has remained for 1 week. It should be noted that only 2 stars (unfortunately only noticed too late) were given for the smaller packaging size, but the full 5 for the larger one. That is very, very strange!
terrible smell and poor result! I dyed my blonde hair into a chocolate brown with an intensive dye in October, in February/March I used this hair dye remover. I used the product twice. The first time I immediately noticed that it stinks terribly! However, there was still not too bad a result, it came out as a kind of chestnut brown (a bit darker). Since I did not achieve my desired result, I used it, as in the instructions for unsatisfactory results, one more time. This time it was pure waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked like the first try. What was even worse, it still stunk weeks after the application. No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell did not go away.
Highly Recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a longer period of time and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a longer period of time due to my work, not enough exercise and an additional long-term illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only through healthy nutrition but also through the intake of vitamin D3 and K2. This works very well. I feel fitter and much better. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommended.
Function not entirely flawless!! After using the battery case for 3 months, I have discovered the following major defects which I find very annoying: 1) The case has problems connecting to the phone over time. This means that it no longer charges even though you have pressed the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. When you remove the phone from the case and put it back in, the problem is solved in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) Frequent removal and reinsertion of the phone into the case has caused the cover to wear out so much that it detaches from the case on its own, which is why I have almost lost it several times. These are not many major defects, but I think that a case with a battery should function flawlessly in its function, which is why I am very disappointed with the product, especially since I have only been using it for 3 months for the cost of 30€.
Too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews come about. In the end, it's actually just a glass cleaning cloth that you get as a gift from every optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is as good as with a kitchen towel and not better. I expected a lot more from these cloths. It's also really very thin. Since I've used it, I unfortunately can't exchange it anymore. I'm disappointed and can't recommend it from my side. The price for these cloths is far too high. More than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower, when my smaller free speaker, which I received as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I fell into the shower with it), gives bass like bass again, Bluetooth works great... The suction cup must of course be watered, otherwise it dissolves... it can reproduce tone very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the singing are almost painful in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just good enough to be audible. My old speaker did not reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were represented in the volume quite naturally. With the Onforu, this is unfortunately not really the case, which I find a bit annoying. Therefore, I have to take off one star. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
At a few places the color was splintered and if you just walked over it with your hand, the color also went away at some places. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want to have them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only exchange the damaged parts, but as if both pieces of furniture were damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon has taken care of everything for us and refunded us the money. A LOB to Amazon
Spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Delivered are individual parts which you have to stick together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which consists of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few templates were damaged. I did not complain about it, since I urgently needed this product. The glue supplied hardly holds, but sticks well - like chewing gum that does not harden. Already one day after sticking, almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden sticks. Since the glue does not dry out (at least it was still not dry five days after sticking), you have to be very careful that everything does not stick together. The templates are partially incomplete punched out. For one-time use and as a gag for a party ok, at a wedding I would, however, invest a little more money and go for a high-quality product.
I am not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closure + nice appearance + stable when assembled + shelf can be positioned as desired
- Doors slamming due to magnets (this can probably be compensated with rubber bumpers) - some dirty spots
- the supplied dowels are much too small and wobbly (I didn't have any others and I didn't have a trophy in the house, so I glued them in place with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf are a bit wobbly (I wrapped them in some paper and leveled them) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and if it didn't have such good measurements, I would give it fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. Also, I think it's a bit too expensive for what it is.
The coffee tastes good to me....but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also significantly more expensive). In this regard, I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run through evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) also means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer will change this and soon score full points.
Set the alarm for me
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound horrible, and extremely loud in addition. I also could not make them quieter. Probably a defect, supposedly this is possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I would immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock, because I thought it was already tomorrow. When it was actually time, it was suddenly too bright for me. I liked the colors and the color change, but unfortunately you cannot dim the colored light. I also liked that it has a battery, so that you do not have to re-enter the clock and the wake-up time in case of a power outage. But I went back because of the mentioned reasons.
Light super, processing insufficient
I replaced four light sources in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a fixture - instead, a circuit board is laughing at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. "6 pay - 4 receive" is not a good deal. Amazon would certainly have resolved this kindly and quickly, but I only discovered this after the return deadline. Therefore, I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these light sources - so far the only reason for two star deduction. The light itself is super. The rooms are now very bright and evenly illuminated. The light color is more in the direction of cold white. Perfect for hallway, office, workshop, laundry room, etc. For living rooms, I would personally go for warmer light. Definitely comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. Other lamps can also do this and maybe I will get intact specimens corresponding to the order. If my rating is helpful, I am happy about a positive rating. I try to answer questions quickly.
Tolle
I have received gestures and I would like to share my first look. Yes, positive. I have been thinking for a long time whether to order this set or not. ** The material is stable and it lies well in the hand. ** The utensils all have a hole at the handle to be able to hang them. ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with a coating. ** They are heat-resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. ** They also do not transfer heat and can therefore be touched directly. ** The dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone, but shortly after wiping and they are gone. Finally, I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-ware sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping just great. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked. We found that the part had already been installed. We had to note considerable scratches and scrapes on all mounting parts. The screw connections/hose connections were all damaged. Despite this, we installed the part in the washbasin (unfortunately). Only now did we see that there were also scratch marks / streaks on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part had probably already been delivered and sent back. We are keeping this faucet and installing it in the washbasin in the basement because it doesn't matter how it looks there. Our conclusion; we will never order such goods via Amazon again, but rather spend a little more at the hardware store where we get decent goods. We find it just sad that customers are being ripped off like this!
Product itself top, external sensor unfortunately already broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation went very easily, and the radio range is also very good, and there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device attractive. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems to be intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably broken, because it always displays completely astronomical values for the outside air humidity. This is very unfortunate, as the device was mounted outside in a protected place, and this is also the reason why I give this product only two stars.
Strong mower with weak catching basket
Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt is still merrily driving through the Republic with Hermes today, without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon with the triggering of a replacement delivery was as always excellent. The lawnmower arrived quickly and made a good impression. The motor is strong and it results in a beautiful cut. The noise level is not exactly impressively low, but okay. The big disadvantage is unfortunately the grass box. On the one hand it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and in between of fabric. If you just set it down briefly when it is only half full, it will of course be compressed and parts of the contents will fall out. Worse, however, is that the actually practical fill level indicator shows red when the grass box is only half full. That would not be so bad if the lawnmower did not then lose large parts of the cut grass. Emptying the grass box with a large lawn area whenever it is only half full is not the solution. Therefore, I have cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good lawnmower, which becomes unusable for me due to the unfortunate construction of the grass box.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The supplied detachable sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if needed. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to save battery life. For the following reasons, I give only 4 stars. - The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite clumsily. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses the connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not connect again by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to remove the batteries and put them back in after a short pause, then it connects again. This should actually work without removing the batteries. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be a bit louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not been able to level the hotbed properly to this day. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high in the back and the screw in the front right falls out, even though it is not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the carriage are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what to do, because it is impossible to print anything this way. For assembly: The assembly was quite problem-free, but one could only show how to lay the cables, because otherwise you have to lay them again and again, which is very exhausting. I have also already contacted the support, but after a week of waiting, I still have not received an answer. Returning is unfortunately no longer possible. I had expected a little more.
robust and precise, I am positively surprised
My old measuring slide has unfortunately given up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to be ordered. This one here gives a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included, so you can start right away. The packaging of the slide is simple, but it fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slide leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it full points and believe it will last at least as long as the old measuring slide. From me, there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and did not wear it for the time being, because it emits a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell has not gone away, even though it has been "aired" constantly. After it was no longer possible to return it, I got rid of it.
Ok for the price
The stars and balls on this necklace are a bit too big for me, so that it looks quite massive. The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice. However, the necklace as a whole is very simply processed, so that I have already ripped the closure open twice. So far, I have been able to repair it every time, but I think that won't last long. But for the low price, you can't really expect anything really high-quality.
Very nice piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't open, amazing! I have rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it even softer and more snugly fitting. Just one thing: if you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately rubbish! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was okay. Now to the function: It only connects after some fiddling.... if you stick to the instructions it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and put it back in did the transmitters finally connect. Unfortunately my joy about that didn't last long, because after only an hour the connection was gone again, and that even though the transmitters were next to the base station. The display of the three transmitters was also very different! All in all, not worth using for me! The thing went back! I would definitely advise against buying it, it only causes trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I already had this garden pump, unfortunately, after 3.5 years, the thread of the internal shaft had rusted away. I bought it again only because I urgently needed it because of the current drought and I knew that the connections of the suction line as well as the discharge line would fit. I hope that the shaft of the previous pump had a production error and that the new pump will last a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, which is why I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future, rather than just using a thin-walled cardboard box. I kept the pump anyway, because as described above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump's performance.
It could have been better thought out. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought that such an organizer would be more pleasant than running around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. At first, everything went quite well. However, the varnish quickly wore off and the screws had to be tightened again and again. It's nice that it also works with a penny, but only with a penny. I didn't find a suitable Phillips screwdriver that wouldn't immediately ruin the whole screw. Now to come to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: attaching the keys. It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths through the different parts, but once you've screwed it together, you need pliers to take it apart again. Attaching the keys themselves is simply a game of patience, balance and dexterity. Finally, the third time I assembled it, the screw broke in the thread and thus the whole thing became unusable. Conclusion: If at all, then only for all the necessary keys once and never again, but at the price, you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite match the stated dimensions
Easy-to-use zippers, the material looks robust and everything in featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will be able to judge the goods only after the first use. Before that, I can already say that the height is lower than stated. At the moment, I still can't really imagine packing everything there for a three-week vacation, for example. If necessary, the really big parts can go directly into the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, since two smaller bags/sachets were contained in the round cosmetic bag. Not of high quality, I wanted to mention that anyway. That the cosmetic bag has a different color tone and consists of a different material than the other bags does not bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that is okay.
So lala
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't work anymore. Battery? Changed. But it still doesn't work. So, I could have just thrown the money in the trash can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush to avoid damaging the needle. I could not hear any improvement in the sound with my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. The battery life is very long. The sound is definitely completely adequate. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and pleasant to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Purchase recommendation in this price class.
nice dress
Very nice dress, which is very wearable for a variety of occasions. The price-performance ratio is perfect, especially since I also got it in the flash sale. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended). I just wish the neckline wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could handle a bit more fabric (if you don't have quite as thin upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a nice dress for many occasions.
Stay away. It can't get any worse. I really and seriously did not expect such junk to be sold today. The drive is operated on a High End Asus ROG Strix Scar II Gaming Laptop. It is safe to assume that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, it is not possible to operate this drive without problems. DVD usually works, Blu-rays are recognized at most unreliably. The discs have to be inserted multiple times, then it makes whirring noises like you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After a few minutes, you can either restart the computer because it won't do anything anymore or the disc is finally recognized. However, under no circumstances should you press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the film or even just do something. This immediately leads to an unsolvable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you additionally buy PowerDVD or similar at a cost, the price of this drive doubles.
It does what it's supposed to do, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually eye wash, because only the port that points up is a USB port. The other plug is only for charging some devices and is therefore relatively useless. I did not know this when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I only needed a plain extension, I certainly would not have bought this unshapely lump with gold plugs. But apart from the appearance and my misjudgment, the extension fulfills its duty very reliably. And because of the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick does not just hang around in the area, as with a completely normal extension cord. So no real wrong purchase, but my euphoria is kept within narrow limits: -).
Small but oho! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) as well as connect a display. With IOS 12, you can now also push data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters that I also had to send back could not do this unfortunately. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Charging at the same time is no problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I need my PlayStation for: P. There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case, it does not fit with the adapter. Well, it still holds securely and has contact from there... All in all, it is a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, it is very small and made of a stable piece of aluminum. Price performance fits.
Lots of power
Top device. Has been running without problems for months. It is not exactly light or quiet, but it delivers a lot of power. I find the middle temperature setting (Tp setting) a bit too cool and am therefore always on level 2. It has also fallen onto the tiled floor several times and has survived it well. And I also like the simple design. Competitor products often look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but it does not make a cheap impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised. In live mode, the tracking is accurate to 0.5m. However, if the dog is in the house in offline mode, it sometimes jumps a few meters, but this is not disturbing. I would buy it again at any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. At the moment, it lasts about 1.5 hours. A solution that lasts 7-14 days would be great. There is an XL version, but unfortunately, it is too big for our taste. As long as the battery does not have to last that long and we have to change it every day, we also find it impractical. You should be busy with the dog, not with his collar:-). The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of rubbish
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the lifespan is getting shorter and shorter. Although my son only wears the shoes in PE, the soles are already falling apart after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. With the last pair, it was also the case that they did not last very long in normal use, but I thought that would be enough for PE. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The shoes are expensive rubbish and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. These here are unfortunately poorly processed at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but upon closer inspection, one can see that the edges are poorly processed and the heel strap sits quite loosely and will probably not last five years like my previous ones.
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read yet, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I am driving to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on a whim. The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump. Regarding the mattress: I tested it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) and noticed that there was some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that it doesn't appear again. After it was pumped up, a lying test was conducted immediately. It is easy to lie on and fits perfectly for the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace one's own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury. The mattress fits perfectly in my car. Previously, we removed the seats in the back. It fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the cigarette lighter of the car. However, the plug was defective (something at the soldering point). Since my boyfriend is handy, he was able to repair it and reassemble it. The good part worked outstandingly and pumped up the mattress in no time at all. Overall, I am very excited about the mattress. I am already looking forward to the hardness test at the festival. I hope that it does not lose air and lasts a long time. Also, that the mold does not appear again. After the test, I can already recommend it. If I have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10 €... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn through the cheap processing directly on day 1 through several doors. At the 21st door, there were no more doors at all and I had to more or less allow my son to also take out the remaining parts because they basically already came along. The parts often come out mixed, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to bring the parts together. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off during play. (Mostly the windshield. This is also very difficult to attach again.) In itself, I would not buy this calendar again and also not recommend it to anyone else. Maybe the manufacturers will reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and make it better. :\
a real drone
I am thrilled with the drone. My 7 year old daughter flies it. It flies very well indoors and the 5 minute flight time is usually more than enough. I didn't expect anything else with the price, but hair getting stuck in it and the drone breaking very quickly are not a problem. Falls from the ceiling onto the floor, whether it's tiles or carpet, are no problem. If you have any questions, the contact is nice.
Game ok but only playable with force to Steam. I did not see that it was not a game CD but only a code with which you can download the game. That would be okay so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play the game at all, which is an outrage. Since then, the computer is constantly hanging, which would not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the runtime of the battery
I was really looking forward to the watch. The design and look are great, messages etc. were displayed without any problems. The operation worked well.... and yet I am sending it back. The big catch: the battery and its running time. Charged in the evening, only on the shelf overnight and in the morning 11% less battery when not in use. If many messages came in during the day, the battery was already at the end at noon / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time anymore. Therefore not usable for me. Very unfortunate.
Luxurious case with limitations
You should definitely get a case for the sleazy Samsung Galaxy S10+. I recently liked cases that you can also put your credit card in. This is what the case offers here. If you put cards in all 3 compartments, it will be too much, then the lid stands a bit high. One is enough for me. The leather case gives a robust impression and seems to be well processed. It looks elegant. The phone is embedded around it, only the connections have cutouts. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. Even on the leather QI charging station from TORRO it does not work. Accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged if the case is off. Otherwise, it looks really cool and well processed!
high-quality case with bulletproof glass film
Robust case with a real bulletproof glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily put on. The material is pleasant in the hand and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some grip. It is not too bulky and fits firmly on the phone. Overall, a good purchase.
