4-word summary
4.1 Overview
The characters in this document are encoded as single-byte, double-byte, or quadruple-byte characters.
The single-byte part contains all 128 characters of 0x00~0x7F in GB/T 11383-1989.
4.3 The two-byte part
The double-byte part includes all graphic characters in GB/T 2312-1980, CJK unified characters in GB/T 13000, and some graphic characters.
The characters in the two-octet part are specified in Appendix A.
In particular, the graphic, code position and function of the symbolic character description shall conform to the provisions of Appendix B.
Note: GB/T 13000 is a unified code for Chinese characters used in China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and other countries and regions.
Chinese characters with unique abstract shapes are assigned a separate code position; Chinese characters with the same abstract shape but different origins are assigned a shared code position.
The encoded Chinese characters are called CJK Unified Ideographs, where CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea.
4.4 The four-character part
The four-byte part contains 66 CJK Unified Ideographs in GB/T 13000 (9FA6 to 9FEF, excluding the 8 characters from 9FB4 to 9FBB), CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension E, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension F, and characters of ethnic minority scripts already encoded in GB/T 13000.
The characters of the four-octet part are specified in Appendix C.
5 Overall structure
All hexadecimal values in the text are preceded by 0x, and all decimal values are not preceded by 0x.
All hexadecimal representations in this appendix are in base 16, and all other numeric representations are in base 10.
The single-byte part adopts the coding structure of GB/T 11383-1989, using 0x00~0x7F code positions.
The double-byte character set (DBCS) uses two eight-bit binary strings to represent one character. The first byte codes range from 0x81 to 0xFE, and the second byte codes range from 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE.
The four-octet part uses GB/T 11383-1989 unused 0x30 to 0x39 as the suffix for expanding the two-octet code, and the coding range is 0x81308130 to 0xFE39FE39.
The first character of a 4-byte character is encoded in the range of 0x81 to 0xFE; the second character is encoded in the range of 0x30 to 0x39; the third character is encoded in the range of 0x81 to 0xFE; and the fourth character is encoded in the range of 0x30 to 0x39. That is, 0x81308130 to 0x81308139; 0x81308230 to 0x81308239; 0x8130FEFE30 to 0x8130FE39; 0x81318130 to 0x81318139; “0URo23061393 0xFE39FE30 to 0xFE39FE39.

The contents of this page are taken from the full documentation of the GNU C Compiler, and are intended only to explain the meaning of the options.
Unless someone volunteers to maintain it, the EURo document is the authoritative document.
If you find any discrepancies between the pages of this manual and the software, please refer to the Info
If we find that the contents of this manual page are causing significant confusion and complaints because they are out of date, we will stop publishing it. There is no other option, such as updating the Info file while updating the man page, because other work maintaining Gnu cc does not leave us time to do this. The GNU project considers the man page to be an outdated product and should spend its time elsewhere.
For complete and up-to-date documentation, refer to the Info files `gee' or Using and Porting GNU CC (for version 2.0) (ft&/HAIZE#H GNU CC 2.0) manuals. Both are derived from the Texinfo source file gee. texinfo.
The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both require one or more of the four steps to process input files: preprocessing, Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The suffix of the source file identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix controls the default settings:
gcc treats the preprocessed file (.i) as a C file and sets the connection in C format,
g++ treats the preprocessed file (.i) as a C++ file and sets up the connection in C++ style.
The suffix of the source file indicates the type of language and post-processing:
.c C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.C C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
. CXX C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i preprocessed C file; compile, assemble
.ii preprocessed C++ files; compilation, assembly
.s assembly language source program; assembly
Compiling language source programs; preprocessing, compiling
.h preprocessor file; usually does not appear on the command line. Files with other suffixes are passed to the linker. Typically includes:
.0 Object file
.a Archive file
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the entire process), linking is always the last step.
During linking, all.e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and non-recognizable filenames (including specified.o H symbolic files and.a library files) are passed to the linker options (OPTIONS) in the order they appear on the command line
The options must be given separately: de ' is not the same as `-d -r '.
Most of the `-fname' and `-fno-name' (or `-Wname' and `-Wno-name') options are the reverse of each other.
Only formats that are not the default are listed here.
Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, with explanations in the following sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Specifies that the language of the input file is language (rather than the default selection derived from the file name).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next optional `-x' option .language
Close any explicit indication of the language, thus based on the file name after post-processing the file with the RE AS E ` -x' option).
If you only want to operate on a part of the four stages (preprocessing, compilation, assembly, linking), you can use the `-x' option (or file name suffix Ah) to tell GCC where to start, and `-c', `-s', or `-E' options to tell GCC where to end. Note that some combinations of options (e.g., `-x cpp-output -E') tell GCC to compile or assemble the source file, ETER. ERA ATI by default, GCC changes the source file name to `.o' and the `.ec' target file name. You can use the `-o' option to choose another name. GCC ignores any unrecognizable input after the `-ec' option.
Finished the target file.
The compilation stops when the translation is complete, and no assembly file is generated.
Work with pipes instead of temporary files at different stages of the compilation process, because those systems' assemblers can't read data from pipes; GNU's assembler doesn't have this problem, and the assembler accepts a "dialect" of C: it accepts C programs that conform to the ANSI standard.
This will close off some features in GNU Cc that are not compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as features such as unix and vax, which indicate the rarely used ANSI trigraph features, as well as disabling the use of ANSI trigraphs even though the standard libraries are available in the hosted environment, the main function returns an int value, a typical example is almost all programs except for the kernel. The corresponding freestanding environment does not have the standard libraries, and the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the kernel of the operating system. For details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website.
For function declarations with no parameters, such as `int foo();', C-style is used -- that is, no number or type of parameters is specified. (This applies only to C++.)
Normally, such a function foo in C++ means the parameter is empty.
The NCurses list has been pruned here in an attempt to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.
Details can be found in the NU c manual, which we have stripped of details so that people don't HERI when the content is out of date.
Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option has an additional effect, allowing this to be assigned.
It's the same as the `-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional C preprocessor.
In particular, the section above about preprocessors does not include the other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers Allows '$' characters in identifiers (C++ only).
You can specify the `-E'fno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to disable the use of the `$' character.
(GNU C++ allows the `$' character by default on some target systems, but not on all.)
-fenum-int-equiv Allows implicit conversions from ant type to enumeration type (MEF++).
Normally, GNU C++ allows conversions from enum to int, but not the other way around.
-fexternal-—templates generates smaller code for template declarations (template declarations only in C++), by generating a copy of each template function only where it is defined.
To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementation` (define) or `#pragma interface` (declare) in all files that use the template.
When you compile with `-fexternal-templates ', all template instantiations are external types. You must have the instances you need appear in the implementation files.
This can be achieved with a typedef that references each instance as needed.
Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-external-templates' is used at compile time, all template instances are explicitly set to be built-in.
All member functions (except the constructor function and the member operator mnew or delete) are considered to be virtual functions of the class in which they are declared.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will go through the internal v-table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch Allows the types of the second and third arguments of a conditional expression to mismatch.
The value of this kind of expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable allows you to assign a value to this (C++ only).
Merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into c++ makes the assignable `this' look out of place.
Therefore, by default, attempts to assign this inside a class member function are invalid.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this work by using the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.
Various machines have their own default char type, which may be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, when relying on symbolic data, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned char.
However, many programs are written to use only simple chars, and period streets are signed numbers (or unsigned numbers, depending on the target machine on which the program is written).
This option, and its inverse, make such a program work on the corresponding default value.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If no `signed' or `unsigned' modifier is explicitly declared, these options are used to define a signed or unsigned bit field, respectively.
By default, bit fields are signed because their underlying integer types, such as int, are signed; however, if the `-traditional' option is specified, bit fields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in writable data segments and does not do any special handling.
This is to maintain compatibility with some old programs; they consider changing the string constant to be a very bad idea, and the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive Summary
The Impact of COVID-19 on the Drug Market
Its impact could be similar to the economic crisis of 2008
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed health-care systems and brought them to the brink of collapse, and the restrictions imposed by governments have caused severe disruptions to the global economy.
The impact of the pandemic on the drug market is unclear and difficult to predict, but it could be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers, unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions, may be forced to find new routes and methods.
Patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may be hampered.
The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but we can still learn some lessons from past crises.
After the economic crisis of 2008, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances and switched to injecting drugs.
At the same time, Governments have cut their drug-related budgets.
If Governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way, interventions to prevent drug use and related risk behaviours, and detoxification and rehabilitation services, could be severely affected.
In addition, the priority given to interception operations and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Countries where significant quantities of drugs are smuggled through commercial flights are expected to be most directly affected by drug trafficking.
Messengers may carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in their backpacks or hidden in their personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. With restrictions on air passenger travel in place almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs is likely to be completely disrupted.
While international postal supply chains have also been disrupted, trafficking through the dark web and parcel post is likely to increase.
In the long run, the economic recession and related lockdown measures could disrupt the drug market.
With rising unemployment and a lack of opportunities, the poor and vulnerable are more likely to use drugs in a harmful way, become addicted and turn to illicit activities related to drugs, whether production or trafficking.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of the situation to provide services to vulnerable populations and recruit new members to grow their ranks.
As the government’s capacity to respond diminishes, these shifts are likely to take root quickly, becoming the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and Complexity
Market Growth
The population growth pattern partly explains why the market is expanding.
Drug abuse is on the increase worldwide, both in terms of overall figures and in terms of the proportion of drug abusers in the world population.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged between 15 and 64, while in 2018, it was estimated that there were 269 million drug users, accounting for 5.3% of this population.
In the past two decades, the growth of drug use in developing countries has far outpaced that in developed countries.
This reflects, to some extent, the differences in overall population growth during this period, 7% for developed countries and 28% for developing countries, but also the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group grew by 16% in developing countries, while it declined by 10% in developed countries.
1Urbanization is a driving factor in the current and future drug markets
In both developed and developing countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher in urban areas than in rural areas.
Part of the reason for the overall increase in drug use is the massive shift of people from rural to urban areas, with more than half of the world's population now living in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization is likely to be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, particularly in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.
Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but the burden of disease is greatest among the poorest people worldwide, and drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are even more firmly associated with the world's wealthier regions.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the socially affluent.
However, people with lower socio-economic status are more likely to develop addiction.
Data from a few countries suggest a link between hazardous drug use patterns and morbidity and low income.
These patterns seem to be less common among the more affluent social classes.
The economic constraints imposed by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as an increase in the unemployment rate, have traditionally been associated with an increase in drug use, while the pandemic has already forced millions of people worldwide out of work.
The COVID-19 pandemic could lead to further expansion of the drug market. The COVID-19 pandemic could lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in the cultivation of illicit crops, either because of a reduction in the ability of national authorities to control them or because, in the context of an economic crisis, more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illicit activities.
Restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a reduction in air and land-based transportation, which may have led to an increase in maritime trafficking, which is less likely to be intercepted at sea and has a higher volume than air or land-based smuggling.
There have been recent reports of cocaine being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The appearance of non-international controlled substances is stable, but new types of opioids with potential hazards are increasing, and the drug market is becoming more complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as marijuana, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of pharmaceuticals is also rapidly increasing.
There are about 500 new types of active substances in the domestic market of member countries every year.
At present, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid agonists and a small amount of opioids.
Although the total number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
Of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, only 2% were new psychoactive substances of the opioid type, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.
Many of the new psychoactive substances in the category of opioids are similar to fentanyl, and their pharmacological effects and hazards have been proven to cause overdose deaths in North America, and to a lesser extent in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is used as a cutting agent for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, and to manufacture counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
Some evidence suggests that injection of new psychoactive substances is also occurring in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many of the syringes contained new psychoactive substances.
2 The use of new psychoactive substances may become entrenched among vulnerable groups
New psychoactive substances of a single type have almost never formed a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported on the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.
Controls on precursor chemicals have forced drug manufacturers to innovate. Many of the chemicals used as precursors to manufacture amphetamine, methamphetamine and Ecstasy-type drugs have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and manufacturers have always been looking for substitutes that are not only less regulated, but also chemicals designed specifically to evade regulation, known as "tailor-made precursors."
Restrictive measures aimed at halting the spread of COVID-19 are likely to put further pressure on drug makers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia was reported to have driven up the price of methamphetamine in Mexico and the United States.
The market is constantly changing.
Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
Seizures of opiates by the authorities in the Russian Federation have fallen by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opiate use has dropped significantly.
But the market for performance-enhancing drugs seems to be thriving.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including ephedrine and a-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, are now widely available on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities reported a sharp rise in recent years in the number of clandestine laboratories producing a variety of illicit drugs, more than doubling in two years to 152 in 2018.
Methamphetamine markets grow in Afghanistan and Iraq
As far back as 2012, surveys of people in hospitals, prisons and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystal methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, in addition to "fenethylline" and ketamine.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with cannabis users indicating that cannabis was more difficult to obtain than "fentanyl" or methamphetamine.
Recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine laboratories, and INCB has expressed concern about the large-scale import of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors in methamphetamine laboratories.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacture appears to have started in 2014.
Since then, seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing.
However, the seizure volume in the first half of 2019 was 657 kg, a sharp increase compared with the previous year.
Large seizures of methamphetamine believed to originate in Afghanistan have been made in other countries, indicating a rapid rise in production in that country.
Policy changes and trends
Most jurisdictions that have legalized non-medical cannabis use have seen an increase in cannabis use
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical cannabis use.
In Colorado and Washington, the two U.S. states that legalized marijuana earliest, the number of adults using marijuana for non-medical purposes has increased, especially in the past month and every day or almost every day, which has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that cannabis use has increased in Uruguay since 2011, and almost doubled last month.
This indicates that the main reason for the increase is the regular and frequent use of cannabis.
Short-term data from Canada also shows that while the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, use also increased.
However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources.
Is the reason behind the sharp drop in global cannabis herb seizures the legalization of cannabis?
In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, as seizures in North America fell by 84% over the past decade.
By contrast, seizures in other parts of the world more than doubled over the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the marijuana market played a key role in the decline.
The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a deterrent effect. It is still difficult to evaluate the effect of the regulation of new psychoactive substances in China.
Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence of use of new psychoactive substances.
In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased following the adoption of domestic legislation.
Vulnerable populations face harms from both licit and illicit drug markets, and opioids used for pain management and palliative care are mainly available in high-income countries.
In 2018, more than 90% of all pharmaceutical opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
Approximately 50% in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
The population of these countries accounts for about 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries account for 88 per cent of the global population, but consume less than 10 per cent of pharmaceutical opioids.
Obstacles to access to opioid medications are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are more at risk of addiction, with around 35.6 million people suffering from addiction in 2018.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of, and exacerbate the consequences of, drug use. This has been confirmed by research in high-income countries, where individual socio-economic trajectories, not just their status at a point in time, are associated with the risk of drug use.
Substance use disorders also exacerbate socio-economic disadvantage, increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby perpetuating the cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic and migrant minorities, sexual and gender diverse groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and those living in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by or face barriers to accessing drug dependence treatment services.
According to the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death, harmful drug use has had a wider social impact over the past 10 years.
From 2007 to 2018, the global disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use increased by 17%.
The disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) caused by untreated chronic hepatitis C among injecting drug users were particularly high, at 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex, and it is difficult to establish a causal link between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited data from around the world suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
But in violent incidents, the role of alcohol seems to be greater than that of drugs.
While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases, this link can be partly attributed to multiple mediating factors, such as socio-economic disadvantage, and other types of adversity, such as individual risk, family environment and peer influences.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, can be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the existence and intensity of violence are more dependent on changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group and strengthen another.
Latest trends
Cannabis is the most commonly used substance, with opioids causing the most harm
It is estimated that 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug in the world.
By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the related hazards of opioid drugs have been ignored due to the small number of users.
Of the estimated 167,000 drug-related deaths in 2017, 66 per cent were caused by these substances, and 50 per cent of the estimated 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death attributable to drug use were caused by these substances.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, it is methadone that exacerbates the opioid crisis; in North America, it is fentanyl. The two regions have almost nothing in common in terms of economics, demographics, or patterns of drug use, but they are both struggling with the opioid crisis fueled by readily available and inexpensive substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to a surge in opioid overdose deaths over the past two decades.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.
Part of the reason that fentanyl causes overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl in the illicit drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of khat has grown significantly.
In the region, more and more patients with chronic diseases are receiving treatment with Qumado.
In 2017, the global interception of fentanyl increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.
But in 2018, after India passed a new law to regulate ketamine, global seizures fell to 32 tonnes.
The crises in both places were fueled by the manufacture of simple and inexpensive products, as well as a lack of international oversight of ketamine and many other Fentanyl-like substances or their precursors.
What exacerbates the crisis in both places is the availability of these substances on both the pharmaceutical and the illicit markets, making it even more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
Increasing use of performance-enhancing drugs
The area of stimulants is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are on the rise in their main markets.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is popular in North America and Western Europe.
Some 27 million people used amphetamine-type stimulants in 2009, with methamphetamine the most commonly used amphetamine-type stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
Based on the majority of indicators available, methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions over the past two decades.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist and sometimes substitute each other, with the use of one drug rising as the use of the other falls, and sometimes increasing and decreasing simultaneously to meet the demands of the same market.
COVID-19 increases risk for injecting drug users
It is estimated that about 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018, and about 10% of the global HIV infections were caused by injecting drugs.
More than 1 million injecting drug users are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million have hepatitis C.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died of drug overdose, half of whom died of liver disease caused by hepatitis B, and the hepatitis B of intravenous drug users is still largely untreated.
The shortage of opioids caused by COVID-19 restrictions could lead users to turn to more readily available substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injecting or injecting more frequently, more harmful patterns of use may emerge.

EU summit debates refugee policy, EU officials: every step of the reception process is a bottleneck - www.chinanews.com
EU summit bickers over refugee policy; EU officials: every step in the reception process is a bottleneck
According to a report by Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit on that day, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that EU leaders agreed to adopt stricter policies on illegal immigrants to make it easier to expel illegal immigrants.
The move was reportedly in response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, where the EU's core problem now is that the number of illegal immigrants who can ultimately be repatriated is small.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the commission to "immediately mobilize significant EU funds" to strengthen external borders with infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU and its member states have been bickering over issues such as the cost of the fence.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not cover the costs.
But diplomats from some member states said that if the EU could share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along its external borders, it would free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.
According to the European Euractiv website, EU officials admitted that every step in the process of accepting refugees was a bottleneck, and the limited capacity of acceptance and the overburdened immigration authorities of member states could not stop refugees from submitting "numerous" asylum applications in EU countries, and the refugee acceptance system of the EU was in a near-permanent crisis.
According to the European Commission, the Schengen countries in the EU received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half more than the previous year.
At the same time, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal border crossings last year.
Against this backdrop, the summit also agreed on a “principle” that EU countries can deport illegal immigrants back to their home countries based on the judgments of the courts of another member country.
In addition, according to the report, EU leaders also agreed to “increase the use of the concept of safe countries”, which will pave the way for the EU to establish a common list.

The United States upgrades the "chip war" and deals a heavy blow to the global semiconductor industry - www.chinanews.com
Recently, the US-China "chip war" has been escalating - first, the Netherlands and Japan, under pressure from the US, agreed to launch controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; later, foreign media reported that the US government is considering cutting off all links between US suppliers and Huawei, banning US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden government is also preparing to publish an executive order to limit US investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries... As early as the beginning of 2023, the US has launched a series of bad moves to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped its actions to suppress China's "chip" development. On the one hand, it has accurately suppressed the semiconductor production and supply chain in China, and on the other hand, it has constructed a "de-China" semiconductor industry chain alliance, aiming to completely "break away" from China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to establish a “technology alliance” with South Korea or a “semiconductor alliance” with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a “semiconductor industrial chain circle” through the “Quadrilateral Mechanism” and the “Indo-Pacific Economic Framework” of the United States, Japan, India and Australia, or to establish a “semiconductor industrial chain circle” through the “Quadrilateral Mechanism” and the “Indo-Pacific Economic Framework” of the United States, Japan, India and Australia, the United States aims to build a closed industrial and supply chain cycle dominated by the United States, so as to make up for its shortcomings in the field of semiconductor manufacturing and maintain its leading position in the global semiconductor industry.
However, the United States' flagrant "chip warfare" against China is also "hurting the enemy 1,000 times and hurting oneself 800 times."
Recently, the Panlin Group, a well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier in the United States, announced that it would lay off 1,300 full-time employees due to the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
Dutch ASML, a global leader in lithography machines, recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to a rise in the price of semiconductors.
According to analysis by the US media, many US companies, including EDA tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves, have been severely affected by the arbitrary suppression of the US government against the semiconductor and other industries in China.
The US so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has already formed a closely connected global semiconductor industry chain.
According to the estimation of professionals, based on the professional division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross the border of various countries more than 70 times, and the whole process takes 100 days.
Although the United States has a relatively strong semiconductor industry foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially in advanced process technologies, and is heavily dependent on the East Asian region.
Even if the United States tries to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the "small circle" regional development dominated by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor industry will be difficult to change.
The United States has carried out a strong “reconstruction” of the semiconductor industry chain of “de-China”, which has severely damaged the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the joint participation of all countries in the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively issuing the Innovation and Competition Act, the US Competition Act of 2022, and the Chips and Science Act, to use technological hegemony to consolidate its technological leading edge; to use “kindness and severity” to induce Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung, and other semiconductor manufacturing enterprises to set up factories in the United States, and to make every effort to ensure the global leadership of the United States in the field of semiconductors.
In the short term, the United States has indeed created trouble for China's semiconductor industry and related industry development, and has reaped real benefits.
However, in the long run, the United States' excessive suppression will push China's semiconductor industry to continuously break through, causing the United States to lose a huge Chinese market, which will ultimately greatly weaken the innovation willingness and innovation ability of US high-tech enterprises, and harm the development of the global semiconductor industry.

The first batch of personal pension wealth management products went on sale, with a minimum holding period of 360 days - www.chinanews.com
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products went on sale
7 products can be selected for home institutions, and the shortest holding period is only 360 days
Personal pension wealth management products have finally been launched.
On February 10, China Wealth Management Network released the first list of personal pension wealth management products, and 7 personal pension wealth management products of Bank of China Wealth Management, Agricultural Bank of China Wealth Management and China Postal Savings Wealth Management were officially launched.
At this point, the "shelves" of personal pension accounts have finally been filled with four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management, personal pension insurance, and personal pension mutual funds.
According to the introduction, the first batch of personal pension wealth management products are all publicly offered net asset value open-end products, including 5 newly issued products and 2 existing products. Except for one product that is a mixed type product, the other 6 products are fixed income type products.
The Beijing Youth Daily reporter found that 4 of the 5 new products were from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which were fixed-income products with the shortest holding period of 365 days, 540 days, 720 days and 1080 days respectively, and the corresponding performance benchmarks (annualized) were 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90% and 5.25% - 5.75% respectively.
The remaining new product is “Postal Savings Wealth Increase Huangqin Longjin Shortest Holding 1095 Days 1 ”, which is also a fixed-income product. It started collecting on February 10 and ended on February 19. The risk level is level 2.
Of the two surviving products, one is Agricultural Bank of China Wealth Management’s “Agricultural Bank of China Harmonious and Dynamic” 360-day Science and Technology Innovation RMB Wealth Management Product, which is of a mixed nature and has a risk level of three.
Another surviving product is “Postal Savings Wealth Prosperity Huangjinyi No. 1 with the Shortest Holding Period of 365 Days”, a fixed-income product that started collecting funds on December 30 last year and officially started operating on January 4 this year. Its cumulative net value on February 8 was 1.0011.
According to the Opinions on Promoting the Development of Individual Pension issued by the Office of the State Council, the financial products that individual pension fund accounts can invest in include bank wealth management products, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and publicly offered funds.
The launch of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marked the official launch of the purchase of wealth management products by personal pension investors through personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the Provisional Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Asset Management Companies.
The Measures stipulate that participants may purchase personal pension products such as personal pension savings, personal pension financial products, personal pension insurance products, and publicly offered personal pension fund products through their personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation jointly issued a notice, clarifying that the individual pension system would be implemented in 36 pilot cities and regions, including Beijing, Tianjin, and the Xiongan New Area in Hebei, as well as Jinzhong in Shanxi.
As of the end of 2022, the number of participants in individual pensions was 19.54 million, and the number of contributors was 6.13 million, with total contributions of 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, banks participating in the pilot only offered three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products, and public pension mutual funds.
Now that personal pension wealth management products have come together, how should investors choose?
According to experts from the product development department of ICBC Wealth Management, compared with other personal pension products, the pilot stage of pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products have three characteristics.
The first is solidity; the risk management mechanism is more complete, investment strategies and concepts are more solid, and independent third-party custody is implemented outside the parent bank.
Second, it is long-term. The duration of the pilot period for long-term care financial products is 5 years or more. In the future, personal pension financial products will be issued with a holding period of at least 1 year, and holding periods of 3 years or more will be encouraged.
Third, it is inclusive. The purchase threshold of products is low, and the starting point is generally 1 yuan, and some are as low as 0.01 yuan. The custody fees, management fees, and other fees of the products are more favorable.
Professionals pointed out that investors should choose according to the characteristics of the products and their own risk tolerance.
The characteristics of personal pension savings are long-term, high interest rates, and high safety, which are suitable for people with low risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on security, which are suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks and can accept stable returns; personal pension investment products and publicly offered fund products have no guarantee of principal and no guarantee of returns, have certain investment risks, but have higher expected returns, which are suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk tolerance.

The fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust - www.chinanews.com
Another large gym “blown up”?
Recently, the protection of the rights of members of a well-known fitness club, Zhongjian Fitness, has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally, and subsequently, rumors about the bankruptcy and disappearance of the institution caused members to panic, leading to the involvement of public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the agency came forward to respond, promising to work hard to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the storm subsided.
Part of the stores of some fitness institutions have operating problems and are temporarily closed. Consumers could calmly wait for the problems to be solved. Why is it that the first reaction of many members is that “something is wrong”?
There is a deep-seated problem of crisis of trust in the fitness club industry behind the advocacy for the rights of fitness club members.
Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt a prepaid model, and “making money from users who don’t come” is the underlying logic of its development.
By obtaining cash flow through the pre-sale of membership cards and opening new stores, it seems that the cycle can be repeated, but in reality, it is like a wolf eating a sheep, and it is impossible to form a stable profit model.
Negative news such as gyms going bankrupt has been reported frequently, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
In terms of market prospects, gyms are undoubtedly a good business with a “prosperous future”.
Although the fitness track has ups and downs, it has always been the focus of capital.
Numerous data show that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption and other areas is rising, and the market is recovering steadily.
Specifically in the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards, the concept of a healthy lifestyle has entered people's hearts, and the fitness industry has great potential for development.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some agencies are overly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption, have just come out of the crisis, and are blowing the horn of expanding the territory, putting all the financing funds into the construction of new stores.
It is undeniable that in recent years, many institutions have withdrawn due to the impact of the epidemic, and the industry has undergone a reshuffle. At this time, powerful enterprises choose to increase their acquisition strength and reorganize, which is undoubtedly a new opportunity.
However, in order for the fitness market to develop and enter into a virtuous cycle, and to embark on a prosperous path, the industry must change its traditional mode of operation and change its business strategy.
Only by persevering and re-establishing consumers' trust and sense of security can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared to grabbing market share with the opening of a new store, what the fitness industry currently needs most is to calm down and optimize services, and to stabilize users with high-quality development.
First of all, we need to rely on services to retain users.
Fitness centers belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to “user orientation”, and to focus on user needs and improve the quality of services.
Secondly, it relies on digital transformation to improve user experience.
For example, the currently popular Internet gym model, which realizes user pay-per-use and self-selected venues.
At the same time, body data and sports data can be effectively utilized, and social needs can also be met, realizing a complete service loop from online to offline.
With no private coaching and no huge annual fees, users’ concerns about gyms “running away” are reduced, and their trust in the gyms is enhanced.
In addition, it is necessary to actively explore a variety of business models.
Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from a single service to scenario consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption. Surrounding products such as sports supplements and fitness equipment required for exercise may become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.

Buy expensive, return the difference!
The real estate market in Nanjing reappears "price compensation" - www.chinanews.com
Jiangsu Evening News (reporter: Ma Zhupo) reported that in an interview on the 10th, reporters from Jiangsu Evening News/Zhi Niu News found that the “protection agreement” that had not been seen for more than 10 years had returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A real estate project in the Nanjing New Area claimed “difference compensation”. Before the handover, the discount of other real estate resources was greater than the discount before, and the developer was willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
“The conditions of the hedging agreement are not few.
The project, located in Jiangbei New Area, is called Poli Yanzi Xieyun Tai, and Sun, a visitor to the project, told reporters that he found a “statement” when he visited the project last weekend.
The pictures he sent to reporters showed that the developer of the project promised that if the buyer purchased the property between February 1 and February 28, the developer could change the property and refund the difference if the discount of other properties in the project was greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous buyer (limited to other unsold properties that belong to the same floor plan, the same building, the same unit, and the same property type).
Mr. Sun said that the property consultant said that this was actually a “price protection agreement”, which aimed to reassure buyers that they did not have to worry about the developer lowering the price for a promotion, “Now we are afraid that the price will be lowered after we have bought it, and we will have no time to go to the sales office to complain. If we don’t complain, we will really feel relieved”.
There are also many home buyers who believe that the "price guarantee agreement" is not low in terms of conditions, even though it is meant to reassure home buyers.
Ms. Zheng, who intends to buy a house for the first time in Jiangbei, said that the house with the price guarantee must be of the same type, in the same building and the same unit, and there are not many houses for buyers to choose from, so the “threshold” is quite high.
There are also buyers who believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not ruled out that additional concessions will be given at the time of sale, making it difficult for buyers to “stand up for their rights”.
It remains to be seen whether they will be able to keep the buyers.
Reporters inquired about the project on the Nanjing online real estate website and found that the project sold 252 units in two buildings in November last year, with floor areas of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, and 129 square meters, and the average selling price of fully furnished units was 39,843 yuan/square meter.
However, more than two months have passed, and online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the project is currently 157, accounting for 62.3%, including 128 units in building No. 8, with a total of 113 unsold units, and 44 unsold units among the 124 units in building No. 7; the total number of transactions in the project is only 33 units, accounting for only 13%.
Market insiders explained that the “protection agreement” had also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, Longtan Xiyuan, a building site on Huangshan Road in Hexi, launched a “price guarantee plan” to attract buyers. The specific content of the plan was “the company solemnly promises that if the discount range of the project is expanded within one year, the company will refund the difference to the old owners according to the difference”.
After that, in April 2011, nine projects in Nanjing also promised to compensate for the difference in price for a portion of their properties.
“The property market is warming up, and we need a ‘stimulant’ at this time.
"Shen, a senior operator in the real estate industry in Nanjing, said that the "guarantee agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of real estate companies.
He believes that developers are more in need of confidence now than home buyers, and the launch of the "price guarantee agreement" is actually to boost their confidence.
As for whether it is possible to retain home buyers, he said that it depends on the influence of multiple factors such as control policies and loan thresholds, and it is still to be observed at present.
Many data decline, Taiwan's economic performance at the beginning of the year is not good - www.chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11 (Reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yanyang) Export trade volume "five consecutive months of decline", Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) contracted for 7 consecutive months, Consumer Price Index (CPI) saw "three-digit"... Recently, the Taiwan authorities successively released the economic data of January 2023.
Experts analyzed that Taiwan's economic performance at the beginning of the year was not good, and the growth pressure was not small.
According to the Financial Affairs Department of the Taiwan authorities, Taiwan's exports amounted to US$31.51 billion in January this year, a year-on-year decrease of 21.2%, marking the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
The export volume of 11 major export commodities showed a decline compared with that of the same period last year.
Rubber and plastic products and optical instruments fell the most, with year-on-year declines of 37.6% and 35.7% respectively.
Exports of electronic components decreased by 20.1% year-on-year, the largest decline in 11 years.
Among them, the annual decline of integrated circuits was 18.3%, the largest decline in 14 years.
Cai Meina, head of the statistics department, said that this showed that the weak demand effect of the consumer electronics industry was spreading, and the electronics industry was entering a period of adjustment.
Statistics show that Taiwan's imports and exports fell in January, with outflows exceeding inflows by only US$2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The Financial Supervisory Department of the Taiwan authorities believes that global terminal demand has decreased, and the adjustment of the industry and the suppression of the willingness of manufacturers to purchase raw materials have led to a decline in exports, and it is difficult to see an improvement in the short term. Taiwan's exports in the first quarter of this year are expected to decline more than expected.
According to the China Economic Research Institute of Taiwan, the seasonally adjusted Taiwan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in January this year was 40.4%, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and contracted for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring indicator system, the PMI is 50% as the demarcation line, and the index is greater than 50%, which represents economic expansion, and vice versa for contraction.
Among the five components of the Taiwan PMI in January, new orders, production and employment contracted, supplier delivery time shortened, and inventory contracted.
All six industries returned to PMI contraction, and the industries were ranked in order of contraction speed as power and mechanical equipment industry (35.1%), electronic and optical industry (35.2%), chemical and biotechnology and medical industry (39.2%), basic raw material industry (42.4%), transportation equipment industry (42.6%) and food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the “Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics” of the Taiwan authorities announced that the year-on-year growth rate of CPI in Taiwan was 3.04% in January this year, breaking through 3% for the second time since July last year.
Among them, the price of vegetables soared by 28.25%, creating a new high in 17 months.
Cai Zhihong, a special commissioner of the Taiwan “Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics”, frankly admitted that the increase in vegetable prices exceeded expectations, excluding the factor of Chinese New Year. The average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year, and the inflation pressure still exists and is still at a high level.
Looking ahead to Taiwan's economy this year, experts are pessimistic, according to reports by domestic media such as United Daily News and Yahoo Finance.
Professor Wu Da Ren of the Economics Department of “Central University” in Taiwan analyzed that the decline in exports may cause export manufacturers to have problems with cash flow and increase the risk of debt default.
At the same time, a reduction in orders leads to a reduction in labor costs for manufacturers, which affects the labor market and household economics, which in turn affects consumption capacity.
Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Economic Research Institute, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States has not been resolved, demand continues to shrink, and it is estimated that the decline in Taiwan's exports will continue in the first half of the year.
As Taiwan's economy is supported by exports, the economic growth performance of the whole year will not be as good as that of last year due to the impact of low exports.
“An important engine of global recovery” - www.chinanews.com
“In the face of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Chinese economy has shown great resilience.
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.
"José Rios, a well-known Chinese affairs expert in Spain and honorary consultant of China Policy Watch, said in an interview with this newspaper that China's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further unleashed.
Liu said that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has dealt with them calmly with its outstanding economic governance experience and measures, which fully reflects its economic resilience and management level.
While China is unwavering in expanding its opening-up to the outside world, the internal driving force of economic development is continuously strengthened, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises develop in tandem.
Every year, the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are held in China, where representatives and delegates jointly discuss the country's development plans and hot-button issues related to people's livelihoods, broadly consolidating consensus, consolidating the people's hearts and minds, and consolidating wisdom, thus adding strength to China's development.
“Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term high-speed development and has now entered the stage of high-quality development.
The international community expects China's wisdom and China's plan, and expects China's development to bring new opportunities to the world.
“At present, China is making every effort to promote scientific and technological innovation, inject new impetus into economic and social development, and ‘financial input, talent cultivation, and policy incentives make China continue to be full of vitality in the new five-year plan’, ” Liu said.
In Rio's view, economic system reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has made use of the advantages of the market economy and the superiority of the socialist system, and has taken proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Around the strategic base of expanding domestic demand, strengthen financial support for the real economy, support the development of private enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing industries, adhere to innovative development, promote employment, improve the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meet the multi-layered and diverse consumption needs of the people, China will fully, accurately and comprehensively implement the new development concept, focus on promoting high-quality development, build a new development pattern, and bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative.
“The stabilization and recovery of the economy after the epidemic is the common goal of the international community.
China's economic development potential will continue to be unleashed, bringing more benefits to countries around the world and becoming an important engine for global recovery.
Liu said that he was looking forward to continuing to build the "One Belt, One Road" cooperation to play its important role in improving the infrastructure level of all countries, strengthening mutual connectivity in all fields, and unleashing greater momentum.

Price standardization and integration of oral implant medical services in Henan Province - www.chinanews.com
CCTV News: Dental implants are the ideal choice for many toothless patients, but the price of tens of thousands of yuan per tooth has always deterred many patients.
Since this year, with the accelerated landing of tooth implant collective procurement, tooth implant price reduction has also been put on the agenda in various places.
Starting from February 10, the price control target for a single conventional implant dental service in Henan Province is 4,300 yuan, and the total cost of a single conventional implant is no more than 97% of the control target.
Tooth implantation refers to a method of tooth restoration for missing teeth based on the bottom structure implanted in the bone tissue to support and fix the upper tooth restoration body.
Reporters learned from Zhengzhou University Affiliated Hospital No. 1 that, for example, a single conventional implant, from implantation to final repair, costs about 16,700 yuan.
Patient: He Ying: After the new policy, the doctor told me that for a case like mine, it would cost about 8,000 yuan or less than 10,000 yuan, which is basically half the price.
On the basis of the existing projects, Henan Province also integrated and determined 15 medical service price items of oral implantation, such as “implant insertion fee (per tooth)”, and unified the prices of public medical institutions under provincial administration and medical insurance payment categories, and canceled or adjusted 20 medical service price items, such as dental implant surgery.
Li Yunjie, Director of the Pharmaceutical Price and Tendering Procurement Department, Zhengzhou Bureau of Medical Insurance: The main beneficiaries are the four parties. One is medical insurance. The expenditure of medical insurance will be reduced. The pressure on hospitals will be reduced, and patients will increase appropriately. For suppliers, this is a market; for us, patients, it is the greatest benefit. The cost of implanting a tooth may be reduced by half or even more.

“New variables” are emerging in China’s e-commerce industry. How can you make “content is king” a reality?
- chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11 - The emergence of "new variables" in China's e-commerce industry, how to make "content the king" of selling?
China News Service Financial Reporter Xia Bin
“We entered the e-commerce market late, but from the very beginning, we realized that content was very important if we wanted to stand out from the millions of stores.
Fangfang, a “post-90s” girl from Guangdong, now operates a store selling nourishing ingredients on the TikTok e-commerce platform, allowing a brick-and-mortar store with more than 30 years of history to “bloom” online.
Opening the Douyin account of Fang Fang, a one-person food blogger, with old Hong Kong film tones and classic Cantonese songs, her exquisite videos are eye-opening.
Recently, at the TikTok e-commerce “Find Peers, Share Quality Content” special event, Fang Fang, as a representative of quality creators, attended the event and shared her experiences and insights on daily creation.
She said at the scene: "The carefully crafted video has attracted the attention of many netizens, and many people are interested in the ingredients in my family, and they want to cook with me, and the market has opened up at once.
”
Fangfang let more people fall in love with "the taste of Laoguang" through soup video, and a live broadcast sold up to 300,000 pieces of nourishing ingredients, saving the old store on the verge of bankruptcy in the family.
“No content, no e-commerce”, with the continuous development of short video and live broadcast e-commerce, people’s requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early days of live streaming sales, live streaming rooms often used low price discounts to attract users, and the price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, there have been phenomenal big Vs such as Liu Yihong and Dongfang Zhenzhu, as well as many non-mainstream celebrities and merchants who have emerged in vertical sub-fields. They have improved their long-term operating benefits by continuously creating high-quality content that is consistent with their brand image.
Haoyaxian, the operation manager of the KOL of the TikTok e-commerce, introduced that over the past year, 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through the TikTok e-commerce, and their content creation has increased by 252%, and the total transaction amount has more than doubled.
“Behind these numbers, we can feel a thriving and vibrant author ecosystem.
"Gao Yaxian said.
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the E-commerce Industry Content Ecosystem Health Index (ECHI) Report, which analyzed the importance of high-quality content in the current e-commerce industry from a data perspective, and assessed the content ecosystem of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China using the index.
According to the ranking of the health index of the content ecology in the e-commerce industry based on the above-mentioned report, TikTok e-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com ranked in the top five.
The report believes that the content ecology in the e-commerce industry is an integrated concept, which integrates e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (professional content production) and UGC (user-generated content) are the high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The content platform value is higher, and the consumption and promotion scenarios are richer, and the possibility of e-commerce insertion is higher, and the commercial value is stronger. The proportion of e-commerce content production and consumption in the public and private domains will gradually be integrated.
At the scene, Professor Yi Guoming, Dean of the School of Journalism and Communication, Beijing Normal University, made an analysis and interpretation of the Report.
He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from “consumer accessibility” to “consumer quality”, and high-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the “hard currency” of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the root and handle of the new stage of the development of e-commerce, and knowledge payment, professional knowledge, KOL (Key Opinion Leaders) and other PGC content have become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Kunming put forward two suggestions.
One is from the perspective of improving the content structure to promote the overall improvement of the health and quality of the e-commerce content ecology, build positive content creation and management standards, and achieve a healthy system index and dynamic balance of the e-commerce content ecology.
The other is to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external ecology.
“In the future, the e-commerce industry still needs more support in terms of data and artificial intelligence to form a prediction of the stability of future development; in addition, it needs to provide more standardized and healthy growth space for merchants, realize the value coordination of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and jointly create a healthy content ecology.

At the opening ceremony of the Seminar on Learning and Implementing the Thought of Xi Jinping on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era and the Spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China for New Members of the Central Committee, Alternate Members of the Central Committee, and Provincial and Departmental Leading Officials, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization construction, profoundly and systematically expounded a series of major relationships that need to be handled in practice, and provided a scientific methodology for vigorously promoting the modernization with Chinese characteristics.
The promotion of modernization with Chinese characteristics involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, ecological civilization, etc., and relates to the governance of the Party, the country, the military, domestic affairs, foreign affairs, diplomacy, national defense, etc. It requires both systematic planning and innovation, and continuous progress.
Top-level design requires profound insight into the trends of world development, an accurate grasp of the common aspirations of the people, in-depth exploration of the laws of economic and social development, and the formulation of a planning and policy system that reflects the times, grasps the laws, and is full of creativity, and that combines the near and the far, connects the top and the bottom, and is coordinated in content.
Advancing the modernization of China is an exploratory undertaking, and there are many unknown areas that need to be boldly explored in practice, so as to promote the development of the cause through reform and innovation, and under no circumstances should we be dogmatic and conservative.
Strategic issues are fundamental issues for a political party and a country.
In promoting the modernization of China in a Chinese way, we should enhance the forward-looking nature of the strategy, scientifically anticipate the future and lead the future; we should enhance the overall nature of the strategy, focus on solving major problems that are crucial to the prosperity and development of the Party and the country as a whole; and we should enhance the stability of the strategy, which means that once the strategy is formed, we should stick to it for a long time, persevere and make steady progress.
It is necessary to scientifically grasp the dialectical unity of strategy and tactics, organically combine the principle of strategy and the flexibility of tactics, be flexible and mobile, adapt to changes, make decisions on the spot, and grasp the strategic initiative in adapting to local conditions, responding to changes, and taking advantage of opportunities.
The Chinese nation is a nation of integrity and innovation.
It is necessary to handle the relationship between upholding the correct direction of socialism with Chinese characteristics and innovation. We should uphold the essence and soul of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and unwaveringly adhere to the fundamental requirements and major principles of socialism with Chinese characteristics, so as to ensure the correct direction of socialism with Chinese characteristics. At the same time, we should put innovation in a prominent position in the overall situation of national development, respond to the requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively adapt to changes and seek changes, and vigorously promote reform and innovation, so as to continuously create new impetus and new advantages for development, and fully unleash the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important basis for fairness, and fairness is a powerful guarantee for efficiency.
In advancing the modernization of China in our own way, we must both create higher efficiency than that of capitalism and more effectively safeguard social fairness, so as to better achieve a balance between efficiency and fairness, and promote and unify them.
We must handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness, and continuously make development for the people, development relying on the people, and development results shared by the people a reality, so that the fruits of modernization will benefit more and more people in a fairer and more equitable way.
To promote modernization in the Chinese way, we need to handle the relationship between vitality and order, so that society is both full of vitality and orderly.
We must integrate development and security, implement the overall national security concept, establish a national security system, enhance our ability to safeguard national security, and resolutely safeguard the security of the state's political power, system, ideology, and key areas.
It is necessary to give more consideration to security factors in development, enhance national security through development, use the results of development to consolidate the foundation of national security, and create a security environment that is conducive to economic and social development, so as to continuously stimulate the vitality of development, achieve high-quality development and high-level security, and achieve a healthy interaction between the two.
In advancing the modernization of China, we must uphold our own path, broaden our horizons, adhere to openness to the outside world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of China's modernization.
We must adhere to self-reliance and self-strengthening, put the development of the country and the nation at the starting point of our own strength, and firmly hold the destiny of our country's development and progress in our own hands.
We must continuously expand high-level opening-up to the outside world, participate deeply in the global industrial division of labor and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, expand the development space of China's modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future through mutually beneficial cooperation.
If you follow the path, you can go far.
Let us, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, follow the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era, grasp the laws and work hard, fully exert our enthusiasm, initiative and creativity, correctly handle a series of major issues, and strive to make new achievements in the new journey of building a socialist modern country in an all-round way, so as to open up a new realm of modernization with Chinese characteristics.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) The Biden administration will blacklist six Chinese entities suspected of participating in the spy balloon plan on Friday (February 10).
The U.S. Department of Commerce said that the five Chinese companies and one research institution helped modernize the Chinese military, especially in aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
Companies on the blacklist have a hard time exporting technology to the United States.
The list, known as the “entity list,” bars listed companies from purchasing technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they obtain special export licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nange Aerospace Science and Technology Co., Ltd., 48th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Longgang Aerospace Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yancheng Aerospace Science and Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhai Xiaohang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Yancheng Aerospace Science and Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Earlier, the White House said it was considering broader measures to "expose and address" China's larger-scale surveillance activities that threaten U.S. national security.
The balloon incident caused further tension between China and the United States, and U.S. Secretary of State Brinken canceled his visit to China.
After the US shot down the balloon on February 4, the Chinese government lodged a strong protest with the US embassy in China, criticizing the US for seriously undermining and damaging the efforts and process of stabilizing Sino-US relations.
Based on the debris evidence and information from the Chinese military's procurement platform, the US government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon was "directly related to the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and was an approved supplier of the Chinese military.
Miao Ning, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, said at a press conference on Friday that China had explained the situation and clarified its position on the accidental entry of a Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle into the airspace of the United States due to force majeure.
According to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she added that the relevant resolution of the US Congress was purely political manipulation and sensationalism.
China expresses its strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this.
U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelrod said: "Today's action demonstrates our shared commitment to identifying and disrupting China's use of espionage balloons that have violated the airspace of the United States and more than 40 countries.
”
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhai Xiang Aviation Technology Co. Ltd. said he was not aware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States and have not yet commented on this information.

(Deutsche Welle) Several days have passed since the earthquake in Turkey and parts of Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is fading. However, the rescue of a family of five on Saturday made the rescuers extremely happy.
According to the Associated Press, a family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days in the hard-hit town of Nourdai in Gaziantep province.
Rescuers first pulled out the mother and daughter from the rubble, and then found the father, but he insisted on rescuing his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, cheers erupted from the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued in harsh freezing conditions.
“What day is it today?
"—the boy trapped under the rubble for 129 hours asked the rescuers who brought him back to the ground.
A man in Kahramanmaras holds the cat he just rescued
The miraculous success of the rescue brought a glimmer of hope to the hopeless search and rescue work, but at the same time, the number of casualties continued to rise.
Currently, according to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has caused more than 20,000 deaths in Turkey, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated to be more than 3,500.
Although experts say that people can survive up to a week after being trapped in the rubble, hopes of finding more survivors are fading.
Rescuers are still using thermal imaging devices to search for signs of life beneath the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of rescue efforts began to shift towards helping the survivors who urgently needed assistance.
UN officials: Disaster in the region "unprecedented in a century"
Martin Griffiths, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said at a press conference in Turkey that the earthquake was the “worst disaster in a century” in the region.
He also praised Turkey's "extraordinary" response to the disaster.
He also told a Reuters reporter that he hoped that the rescue could be provided to the Syrian government and the areas controlled by the opposition, but also said that the matter was "not yet clear."
The United Nations has pledged to provide an additional $25 million in relief aid to people affected by the earthquake in Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced $25 million in funding for relief efforts in both Turkey and Syria.

Google's AI chatbot "answered the wrong question" and its parent company's stock price evaporated trillions of dollars
(Combined report on the 11th)
Google's new artificial intelligence chatbot Bard suffered a setback when it "got the answer wrong" in a promotional video, causing Alphabet, Google's parent company, to plunge as much as 8.9% on Wednesday, dropping below US$100 (RM476.50) for the first time and wiping out US$1.1 trillion (RM4.765 trillion) in market value, closing at US$94.57 on Friday.
The market is worried that Alphabet is lagging behind its competitor Microsoft.
According to a report by Reuters, Google earlier released a promotional video of AI chat robot Bard on social media. In the video, someone asked Bard: "Can you tell me about the new discoveries of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for my 9-year-old child?
In his response, Bard mentioned that the telescope had taken the first photo of an exoplanet.
However, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States, the first photo of an exoplanet was taken by the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory in 2004.
Reuters even reported under the title “Alphabet shares plunge after Bard’s incorrect answer”.
On the other hand, Google pointed out that Bard's response "emphasizes the importance of a rigorous testing process" and will combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's response "meets high standards based on quality, safety and authenticity."

The development of a health and wellness attraction in the Bay South area, which includes Gardens by the Bay and the Bay South Esplanade, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism and economy by encouraging visitors to spend more time and money in Singapore.
Chen Jianlou, Director of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in the next few years, health and wellness will become an important component of Singapore's tourism products.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, the Tourism Board has been promoting health and wellness programmes to the local community and international visitors over the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held the first Health and Wellness Festival, providing the public with more than 130 types of health activities and experiences.
Singapore will continue to offer new travel experiences for visitors.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children’s Museum, the Avatar Grove in Sentosa’s Gardens by the Bay, the St. John’s Central Beach Bazaar, the new “Explore New Horizons” exhibition at the Art Science Museum, and the new open-air theatre at the Night Safari, the Tourism Board will support the development and upgrading of attractions such as the Bird Paradise at Wildlife Reserves Singapore’s Jurong Bird Park to make Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will formulate relevant industry standards for the sustainable development of conferences, exhibitions and incentive tourism by the end of 2023, and focus on improving the problems of waste treatment and carbon emissions, so as to further optimize the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
According to the data, as of December 18, 2022, the passenger flow of Changi Airport has recovered strongly, with more than 150,000 passengers received daily, about 1 million passengers received weekly, accounting for about 75% of that before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the number of employees in the aviation industry has also recovered to about 90% of that before the pandemic.
According to the data, from January to October 2022, Singapore received 23.6 million tourists, accounting for 42% of the pre-epidemic period, and 170,000 flights took off and landed, accounting for 53% of the pre-epidemic period.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also driven the recovery of the accommodation, transportation, catering and shopping industries.
The Singapore government and the tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
According to a survey conducted by a Chinese travel platform, the safety index of Singapore ranks among the top three in the world, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is so popular among Chinese tourists.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, about 3.6 million Chinese tourists visited Singapore every year.
As China relaxes its border policies, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists will recover to 30% to 60% of that in 2019 this year.
Kok Suet-Dan pointed out that in the future, the Tourism Board will closely monitor the signals released by China regarding the policies for outbound travel, in order to cope with changes in the needs of tourists.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to new trends in outbound travel from China.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that the tourism industry will recover faster than expected, as long as the global economy does not experience a significant recession that affects public income, and as long as there are no new large-scale fatal epidemics.
Kim Jong-un and his daughter interacted closely, while his wife was neglected.
(Combined report on the 11th) On the evening of the 8th, North Korea held a military parade to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the army, and the daughter of leader Kim Jong-un, Kim Ju-ae, not only attended the parade, but also stood on the podium with her father.
The official media of North Korea released a video on the 9th, showing Kim Jong-un hugging his father, exchanging affectionate glances and whispers several times, gently holding her father's face with both hands, and even touching her father's chest. The interaction between the father and daughter was broadcasted to the whole country.
However, the first lady, Liu Shiwu, had to stand aside.
According to reports by the Korean “Chosun News” and others, on the 7th, Kim Jong-un and his wife, Ri Sol-ju, brought their daughter, Kim Ju-ae, to attend a banquet. In the official photo of the couple and their daughter, Kim Ju-ae not only sat in the C position in the middle of her parents, which is rare, but she also stood on the podium with Kim Jong-un at the military parade on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the army the next evening.
KCTV, the official media outlet of North Korea, later released footage of the parade, exposing more scenes of deep father-daughter love.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times from the podium, and their smiles never left their faces. They also whispered to each other in their ears. Kim Jong-un hugged his father's cheeks with both hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a bright smile.
Other CCTV footage also shows that Kim Jong-un's mistress was continuously touching her father's face while sitting on an indoor sofa with Kim Jong-un, and that she was touching Kim Jong-un's chest while walking with her father holding her hand.
The First Lady, Liu Shiwu, could only walk behind or sit on the side, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
According to South Korean media, Kim Jong-un has appeared in public five times since November 18, 2017, when the Hwasong-17 missile was test-fired for the first time, and his exposure rate has been increasing over the past three months.
The official media of North Korea referred to Kim Jong-un as the most beloved son, the distinguished son, etc., with the highest honorifics, and also broadcast footage of Kim Jong-un repeatedly shouting his pledge to die defending his bloodline while overlooking the parade from the stands.
These signs make the outside world doubt whether Kim Jong-un has been predetermined as the inheritor of the Kim regime, and the Washington Post analyzes that "this is a signal from Kim Jong-un to push his daughter, who is in middle school, to the position of the successor"; however, there is also an opinion that it is too early to make such a judgment, and there are still various possibilities in the case that Kim Jong-un has a son under his knee.
Chongyang Q&A︱How to view the unexpectedly high US non-farm employment data in January and the future trend - 经济观察网 － Professional financial news website
Q: How does Reignwood Investment view the January non-agricultural employment data in the United States, which greatly exceeded expectations, and the future trend?
A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor released the non-agricultural employment data for January 2023, with 51.7 thousand new non-agricultural jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 18.9 thousand; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; the hourly wage increased by 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, with a slight slowdown.
In terms of quantity, there are many one-time and technical factors affecting the data this time, such as teachers returning to work after strikes, revisions to the scope of the survey statistics, and updates to the seasonal adjustment factor. The data may be revised in the future (refer to the increase in non-farm payrolls from 504,000 to 364,000 in January 2022), and non-farm employment is not as strong as the data shows.
In terms of structure, the impact of layoffs on high-tech enterprises is still there, but the proportion is relatively low; the newly added employment in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care has rebounded significantly, and the data shows that the labor shortage in the service industry still exists.
In conjunction with the equally strong service sector PMI, the rebound in job vacancies and the labor gap data, and the strong consumption credit data, we judge that the US service sector has experienced rapid recovery after the extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that the supply-demand tension in the US employment market will be difficult to improve without a recession.
At present, the US labor market still has a supply gap of more than 5 million, and the labor participation rate is slow to rise, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 years old has approached the pre-epidemic high point.
In addition, strong consumer demand, driven by excess savings and strong consumer credit among US residents, will further delay the impact of austerity policies on the employment market.
The supply and demand of the US employment market will continue to be tight, which will be the bottom line of the US economy in 2023.
We are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth, given the ongoing fluctuations in inflation expectations and the upcoming end of interest rate hikes.
Prior to this data release, the US stock, bond and foreign exchange markets were too optimistic about the Fed's path of interest rate hikes.
With the continued improvement of inflation data, the Fed has been maintaining a balance between shortening the pace of interest rate hikes and sustaining market inflation expectations, but the market has ignored the Fed's hawkish expression and expects the Fed to stop raising interest rates earlier and cut interest rates twice at the end of the year.
In the context of tight labor market supply and demand and the unclear impact of contraction policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of extreme market expectations and the congestion of transactions will cause some harm to the market.
Despite this, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change in the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of various leading indicators of CPI, the US CPI data has turned to a period of rapid decline since October, and the stubbornness of wage growth will only provide a cushion for future inflation data. It is difficult to prove the current market expectations, and the market may enter a new round of competition after the next inflation data is released.
The founder of Suning, Zheng Yonggang, passed away due to sudden heart disease. He once led the transformation of China's first clothing stock - Economic Observer - a professional financial news website
On February 11, 2023, the WeChat public account of Xinhua News Agency (hereinafter referred to as "Xinhua News Agency") issued an announcement that Zhongsheng Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Zhongsheng Holdings") announced that Zhongsheng Enterprise's founder and chairman of the board of directors of Zhongsheng Holdings, Zheng Yongqiang, died of sudden heart disease on February 10, 2023, and was 65 years old.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the factory manager of a state-owned cotton spinning factory. After being transferred, Zheng Yonggang became the factory manager of Ningbo Yun港 Garment General Factory, the predecessor of Xinjiang Sunner Bois, in 1989.
In December 2022, at the 20th China Enterprise Leaders Annual Meeting and the 22nd China Enterprise Future Stars Annual Meeting, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the market share of the Suning brand was as high as 37%.
Suning Holdings Group was listed in 1996 (600884.SH) and became the first listed company in China's clothing industry.
At a time when the garment business was booming, Suning Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that “once the market is opened up, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and Suning Suit will not be able to monopolize the market for a long time, and it is unlikely to become the national suit for a long time”.
In 1999, Suning began to study the transformation of enterprises, and Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, “We came to Shanghai to find out what to transform into, and we specially invited a lot of experts and scholars, and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings and Taoyuan seminars.
Finally, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is big health with a future. "
After determining the strategic direction, SunSun began to look for cooperation. At that time, the carbon research institute of Anshan Thermal Power Institute was doing the national 863 project for Anshan Steel, and the scientific research funds were not enough, so SunSun and the carbon research institute of Anshan Thermal Power Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "intermediate carbon microspheres", engage in the research and development, production and sales of negative materials, and realize the commercial promotion of negative materials in the domestic market.
In 2001, Shenshan achieved the mass production of spherical graphite intercalation compound (SGIC), and began domestic substitution, replacing Japan to become the main supplier of spherical graphite intercalation compound in China.
It is the first lithium-ion battery negative material production enterprise in China, realizing the domestic production of lithium-ion battery negative materials.
With the rapid popularization of lithium batteries, Shanshan's lithium battery business began to develop gradually, and in 2007, the lithium battery material business was written into the main business of Shanshan; the proportion of revenue from the clothing business decreased year by year, and in 2013, the revenue of Shanshan's lithium battery material business completely surpassed that of the clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan successfully acquired the LG Chem polarizing film business and entered the LCD polarizing film market, and established Shansheng Optoelectronics, a polarizing film enterprise. The technology content in this field is relatively high, and Shanshan's main competitors are the world's top 500 companies such as Samsung in South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical in Japan, and JDI.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management, “Chinese private enterprises acquire some high-tech enterprises internationally, and the success rate is relatively low. Why do those acquisitions fail?
Because everyone will consider, I have spent so much money, I have to send people to manage it, this is a behavior that is usually done, ” however, Zheng Yonggang is different, on the day of the successful acquisition of SunSewell, Zheng Yonggang announced in front of SunSewell that SunSewell, as a large shareholder of SunSewell, decided to implement one enterprise two systems, except that Zheng Yonggang served as the chairman of the board, people of SunSewell Enterprise would not be sent to SunSewell, and the mode of authorized operation would be adopted, and the existing distribution system, enterprise culture, various management modes and so on would remain unchanged.
According to the negative electrode data released by ICC Xintong News in 2022, the negative electrode of Shanshan exceeded 200,000 tons in 2022, with a year-on-year increase of 100%, with a market share of 16%, and the negative electrode material of artificial graphite ranked first.
In terms of the polarizing film business, Yano Research statistics show that Sunkai Optoelectronics, a subsidiary of the company, accounted for 29% of the global market share in 2022, and it is expected that the market share will reach 32% in 2023, ranking first in the world continuously.
In the first three quarters of 2022, the revenue of SunSun Pharmaceutical was 15.841 billion yuan, and the net profit was 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, the stock price of SunSun Pharmaceutical was 19.24 yuan/share, and the total market value was 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, SunSun said on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's activated graphite production capacity will be about 100,000 tons, and the graphitization production capacity of the Mei County project is still increasing.
According to Wind, Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshui.
According to Tianyancha, Zheng Yonggang holds a total shareholding proportion of 40.1% in Shanshui Cultivation Holdings Limited.
The general manager of SunSun is Li Zhixia, born in 1968, and has served as the chairman of Dongguan SunSun Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo SunSun New Materials Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan SunSun Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and deputy general manager of Ningbo SunSun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
On February 10, 2020, SunSun stated on the investor interaction platform that there is no blood relationship between the senior management of the Company and the actual controllers of the Company.
“Fund E account” has arrived: the CSRC authorizes the development of the collection and inquiry of all funds in the name of investors - Economic Observation - 专业财经新闻网站 Economic Observation - 专业财经新闻网站
Reporter Chen Miao, Economic Observer: The channels for purchasing funds are complicated, which makes it difficult to collect account information?
Always forget the “petty cash”?
These problems of the common people are about to be solved.
On February 10, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) issued a notice stating that the “Fund E Account” APP was available for download from various mobile application stores and was open for public testing.
According to the introduction, “Fund E Account” provides a “one-stop” query service for public fund accounts and share information for individual investors, aiming to solve the pain points of forgetting accounts, complicated queries, etc. for the majority of small and medium-sized investors.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there were a total of 156 mutual fund managers in the country, managing fund assets of about 26 trillion yuan; there were 167 mutual fund share registration institutions and 411 mutual fund sales institutions.
The account system of each registered institution is independent, and there is no unified query channel in the industry.
Industry insiders said that at the end of 2021, China's fund investors exceeded 720 million, which means that half of the country's population invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to inquire about their purchases through different sales institutions, but through the “Fund E account”, they can inquire about their purchases through all sales channels, making it easy to keep track of their holdings.
What is the “Fund E Account” app?
According to the relevant documents, the “Fund E account” APP is a mobile application developed and constructed by China Securities for the mutual fund industry, which has been approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It can provide investors with one-stop inquiry on the off-market shareholding of mutual fund products.
Investors can conveniently and quickly grasp their holdings of off-exchange shares of publicly offered fund products of all fund managers they have purchased through all sales channels of the whole market through “Fund E Account”, which comprehensively improves the efficiency of inquiries.
Specifically, the information that investors can query through the "fund E account" includes: fund account information opened at all public fund managers, transaction account information opened at public fund sales institutions, and the situation of holding off-exchange shares of products such as publicly offered securities investment funds and collective asset management plans established and managed by securities companies, where the number of investors is not limited to 200.
Liu Yicheng, the person in charge of the business of Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told the reporter of Economic Observer that investors can know their holdings of all off-exchange public funds through the "Fund E Account" App, help them find their "forgotten assets", and more importantly, it helps customers to collect comprehensive account information of fund investment, help customers to grasp their investment situation more timely, accurately and comprehensively, and thus better optimize their fund portfolio and better plan their financial arrangements.
How to register and use?
Reporters noted that at present, the "Fund E account" APP has been uploaded to the app stores of Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, and vivo, but the APP is still in the public trial operation stage, and registration requires filling in an invitation code, which can be obtained by investors by contacting the fund management company holding the fund.
A customer service person from a large public fund in Shanghai provided a six-digit invitation code to the reporter of Economic Observer and told the reporter, "During the trial operation of the APP, China Clearing provided a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager, and investors can get them by calling us, and we will provide them.
After the trial run is over, the invitation code will no longer be required for open user registration.
”
The reporter registered the account and completed the inquiry by downloading and using the relevant documents of the “Fund E account” published on the official website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The whole process only took a few minutes and was mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real name authentication, bonding of the fund account, and public fund inquiry.
After completing the real-name authentication, click the “Assets” fund binding button, and all the fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms will be displayed in the binding option list (bindable account); after binding, you can see the total assets of the funds you have invested in at a glance, and you can also start using the query function.
It is noteworthy that the “Fund E account” only provides query services for investors and cannot be used for redemption and trading.
The data displayed in the “Fund E account” is generally three trading days prior to the date of the user’s query (T day).
For example, when you opened the “Fund E account” on February 10, the total assets, fund shares, and net asset values displayed on the asset page corresponded to three trading days before that date, i.e., February 7.

The United States, Japan, and the Philippines have reached a consensus on defense against the CCP
Asia – On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Both sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's infringement on the South China Sea and East China Sea. The leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement after the meeting, saying that they would sign a trilateral defense agreement with the United States to conduct substantive defense exchanges and oppose the hegemonic policy of the CCP.
According to Japanese media reports, Kishida wants to use this meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies to deal with the crisis in the Taiwan Strait.
Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun visited China in early January and signed a deal worth $20 billion.
But after that, Sino-Philippine relations not only did not improve, but rather deteriorated.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States, agreeing to open more bases to the US military to safeguard security in the South China Sea.
One of the new bases is located 300 kilometers from Taiwan, which is the closest location to China.
If there is a crisis in Taiwan, the US military may launch an operation from its base in the Philippines.
Japanese media believes that now Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and the Philippines have formed an axis with the United States, constructing the “anti-CCP arc line” in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
National Party Vice Chairman Xia Litian conveys Song Tao's message during his visit to China: welcome the Green Party to visit Taiwan under the 92 Consensus
The Vice Chairman of the Chinese Nationalist Party of Taiwan, Shih Li-yun, met with Song Tao, Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China, and Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, during his visit to China.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor of Guomindang's official institution, Guoguang Foundation, was interviewed by the Central News Agency of Taiwan yesterday evening. He gave a positive comment on Song Tao's words to Xi Lianyin, saying that China welcomed Green Party members to visit the mainland as long as they recognized the "92 Consensus" and opposed Taiwan independence.
The KMT side evaluated it as a new thing.
Xia Litian's meeting with Song Tao earlier in the day was not mentioned in that day's news.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan has been clarifying for days that it refuses to accept the "92 Consensus".
According to the Central News Agency today, Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang Shali Yin led a delegation to visit the mainland. During their stay in Beijing, they met with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Song Tao, the new Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and Yin Li, the Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee.
In their meeting, Xia Litian and Song Tao talked about the political foundation of the Guomindang and the Kuomintang, which is the "92 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, senior advisor of the Nationalist Party's National Government Fund, said in the meeting that the "92 Consensus" of the Nationalist Party is the original "92 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this was different from the previous meetings he participated in.
In recent video conferences with scholars on the mainland, as well as in this one, I did not hear any mention of the use of force or the “anti-secession law” by Taiwan scholars. Instead, there was a call for the resumption of exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the situation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait was tense, and the Chinese mainland hoped to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the CPC and the DPP, the other party is still willing to do a good job for the people of Taiwan, and the representative does not want the cross-strait relations to be ruined.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally gave instructions to Song Tao, saying, “You must implement the demands made by them (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen)”, and if it is not possible to solve the problem comprehensively, it should be handled on a case-by-case basis.
The report did not mention whether the KMT people mentioned the daily harassment of China's military aircraft and warships, the agricultural and fishery problems of Taiwan's few counties and cities, and whether the reporter of Central Daily News asked such questions during the interview.
Union Again Rallies Mass Demonstration Against the Retirement Reform Program of the Government
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions again launched a nationwide mobilization against the government's draft pension reform, calling on people to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action in the social movement against the draft reform of the government pension system.
The number of people who responded to the call for the rally may affect the next action plan of the trade union group.
This is the fourth time in a month that the eight major French trade unions have jointly launched a nationwide mobilization, and it is the first time that this protest activity has arranged a gathering on Saturday.
Given that Saturday is a day off for most French people, who do not need to choose between participating in a demonstration or a strike, trade unions are hoping that today's gathering will attract more people.
Transit, subway and Amtrak unions did not call for a work stoppage today, and the transit system should be running normally, allowing people to get to the rallies, while people in areas where schools start winter break can go on their planned vacations.
The unions hope that more than a million people will take part in the demonstration today, while the police expect between 600,000 and 800,000 people nationwide, with 90,000 to 120,000 in the city of Paris.
Since the start of the protests against the government's pension reform plan, the number of people taking to the streets has dwindled, although opinion polls show that most French people do not support the measure to raise the legal retirement age from 62 to 64.
The first strike demonstration on January 31 gathered 1.27 million to 2.5 million people nationwide.
The number of protesters on Tuesday (February 7) had dwindled to between 757,000 and 2 million nationwide.
The pension reform plan is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
Opposition parties, particularly those led by the radical left, have submitted countless amendment proposals, which have slowed down the deliberation process.
The debate between the two parties has also become increasingly intense and acrimonious.
A member of parliament from the radical left-wing party France Insoumise recently posted a picture on social media of himself stepping on a balloon with the image of the Minister of Labor, sparking protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly ultimately banned the member from parliamentary activities for 15 days as punishment for the behavior.
Although the reform plan has sparked the largest social movement in France in more than two decades, so far the government has made only minor adjustments to the draft and has not made any major concessions.
The trade union has already prepared to launch action again on Thursday next week, March 16, and on March 7, when the draft reform is sent to the Senate for discussion, the trade union also plans to organize a demonstration.
China encourages raising the birth rate to donate sperm to colleges and universities of high quality and high standards
The Human Sperm Bank in Yunnan Province, China, issued an advertisement on the 9th to solicit donations of sperm from college graduates or students, with a subsidy of 4,500 yuan for successful donations of 8 to 12 times.
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the message went viral on Sina Weibo on the same day and triggered follow-up initiatives in Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Beijing, among many other provinces and cities.
According to a report by the Free Times under the byline, China encourages university students to donate sperm.
Among universities and colleges across the country, Beijing has the highest sperm donation threshold. In addition to academic qualifications, donors must also be taller than 1.7 meters, have good facial features, no obvious hair loss, and no higher than 600 degrees of myopia.
According to the report, the sperm bank of Yunnan Province pointed out that the sperm donors could get a full set of male reproductive health examination worth 1,000 yuan, “especially semen and chromosome examination, which most people have never done before, and it is of great significance to know their reproductive status”.
The conditions for sperm donors include a height of 165 cm or above, a college degree or above, no color blindness or weak color vision, and no genetic diseases or infectious diseases.
According to Chinese Tianmu News, posters in the human sperm bank in Shaanxi Province carry the slogan “paid sperm donation is honorable” and call on young people to donate sperm, while encouraging netizens to forward the message and “spread love”.
The price in Shaanxi is higher than that in Yunnan, and eligible donors can receive RMB300 in cash each time, and donors who complete a certain number of donations can receive a subsidy of RMB5,000.
Currently, the highest known price is in Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5,150 yuan.
East Germany's last communist prime minister dies
The successors of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement that "last night Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.
Therefore, our party has lost an important leader.
”
On November 13, 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall, which separated East Berlin and West Berlin for 28 years, Modrow said he would help turn East Germany into a democratic country.
At the time, communist leaders were forced from power as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
After coming to power in the Soviet Union, Gorbachev called for change in the Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free election in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led to him no longer serving as Prime Minister.
Despite Modrow's reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and reunification that took place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to reform rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Morales was found guilty of electoral fraud in the municipal elections of May 1989, but he did not go to jail.
The allegations are said to be politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modrow continued to serve in the German parliament and was a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modi sees himself as a reformer and wants to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the old East Germany to return, but said that the achievements of East Germany should be recognized.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica in Poland) and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a sergeant in a youth fire brigade and, as the conflict drew to a close, became a member of the Nazi militia, the Volkssturm, which conscripted men aged 16 to 60 for the final struggle.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by the Soviet army and taken as a prisoner of war to the Soviet Union, where he took part in anti-fascist courses and became a committed communist.
In 1949, the year of the founding of East Germany, he returned home and found a job as a mechanic, while continuing to study social sciences and economics and earning a doctorate.
Modrow was a member of the Free German Youth movement, which almost all East German young people joined, and rose through the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) to become chairman of the Dresden district between 1973 and 1989.
He also served in the parliament of East Germany for more than 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany and held the highest state office.
Iran Commemorates Revolution Anniversary, President's TV Speech Shocks Hackers Supporting Protests
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official gathering on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted a televised speech by President Ebrahim Raisi.
The president's televised address was interrupted for about a minute on the internet by a group of anti-Iranian government hackers, whose name was "Edalat Ali (Ali Justice)."
There were also shouts of "Death to the Islamic Republic."
According to a report by Reuters today, hackers disrupted the coverage of the national television station on the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution.
Iran's official commemoration of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution faced its boldest challenge yet from young protesters demanding the hard-line government's ouster, but Raisi still called on "deceived youth" to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran's top leader.
Protests continue to sweep across Iran following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in custody of the country's morality police in September.
The deadly crackdown by Iran's security forces on protests is one of the strongest challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since the 1979 revolution overthrew 2,500 years of monarchy.
As part of a general amnesty to mark the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities on Friday released jailed dissident Farhad Meysami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelkhah, who had been on hunger strike to protest their detention.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a general amnesty that includes prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
According to human rights organization HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors.
Another 70 government security personnel were reportedly killed.
As many as 19,763 protesters were believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and state media have been calling for a vote at Saturday's gathering to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On the night of Friday, the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media showed fireworks as part of government-sponsored celebrations, with people shouting "Allahu Akbar!
(God is the greatest!)”
Nonetheless, many in the crowd could be heard shouting, "Down with the dictator!"
” and the “Death of the Islamic Republic” in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, state television broadcast live footage of official rallies across the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebrations, domestically produced anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine frigates, and other military equipment were showcased.
President Lesin’s speech was frequently interrupted by chants of “U.S.A., go to hell” — a signature chant at rallies in the state.
The crowd also shouted "Death to Israel."
Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals held in Iran, a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months, Reuters said.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on charges of national security.
They later placed her under house arrest, but she returned to prison in January.
Adelkhah denied the accusations.
Meszaros was released a week ago after supporters warned he was at risk of death due to his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of headscarves.
France's foreign ministry on Friday welcomed Adelkhah's release and called for her freedom to be restored "including, if she so wishes, allowing her to return to France."

Did the balloon incident wake up America?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal today, after the balloon incident, the United States is preparing to further tighten the export of technology to China.
Current and former security officials say the balloon incident underscores the national security threat posed by China and will generate more political support for strengthening U.S. technology protections.
The United States said that the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior official of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and now a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank New America Security Center.
“This is undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire and supporting the hardliners against China.”
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday that "we will also consider taking broader action to expose and address the larger scope of China's surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security, as well as to our allies and partners.
U.S. officials say they have briefed the governments of more than 30 countries on the balloon incidents, underscoring the importance of international coordination in confronting the Chinese threat.
Emily Benson, a senior research fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly established Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party in the U.S. House of Representatives may also put pressure on the United States to take more severe measures to slow down China's development.
She said lawmakers would feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which could in turn force the White House to adopt a tougher policy.
The Wall Street Journal said that many people who advocate stricter export controls are also promoting the expansion of the scope of controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government is also developing a foreign investment review plan to examine whether U.S. investments overseas pose potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls to move more quickly on the plan.
Syria-Turkey earthquake disaster relief work continues day and night
Rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working tirelessly in the rubble of thousands of buildings destroyed by the powerful earthquake that hit Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescuing survivors buried under debris.
In the frigid temperatures, they often call for quiet as they strain to hear any signs of life from the crumbling pile of concrete.
According to a report by Reuters today, two more women were rescued from the ruins of the earthquake after surviving for several days.
However, the number of deaths caused by the earthquake rose to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey was 20,665 people, and the death toll in Syria exceeded 3,500 people.
The 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck on Monday was followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, and is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and coming close to the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similar strong earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Two women were trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake to hit the region in two decades, the Turkish authorities said on Saturday, as rescuers pulled the women from the rubble of a collapsed building in Turkey.
The other injured man, 55-year-old Masallah Cicek, was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, Turkey's largest southeastern city.
In the frigid temperatures, rescuers often pleaded for quiet as they strained to hear any signs of life amid the rubble.
In the Samandag district of Turkey, rescuers crouched under concrete slabs, whispering "Inshallah" -- "God willing" -- as they carefully reached into the rubble to pull out a 10-day-old newborn.
He opened his eyes and the baby, Yagiz Ulas, was wrapped in a blanket and taken to the field hospital.
Video footage showed that paramedics also took away his mother, who was dizzy and pale-faced on a stretcher, but conscious.
Fuat Oktay, Turkey's deputy prime minister, told reporters overnight that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, with a total of 31,000 rescuers deployed in the affected areas.
He said that around 80,000 people were receiving treatment in hospitals, while 1.05 million were homeless due to the earthquake and were crammed into makeshift shelters.
With many lacking food in the cold winter conditions, the public is increasingly questioning the leaders' response to the disaster.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife, Asma, visited a hospital in Aleppo, according to Syrian state media, reportedly the first time he has visited a disaster area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said it was running out of stocks in northwestern Syria, which is controlled by rebels, as the war situation complicated rescue work.
On Friday, Mr. Erdogan visited Adiyaman province in Turkey, where he acknowledged that the government's response had not been as fast as it should have been.
Opponents have seized on the issue to attack Erdoğan, who is seeking re-election in a vote on May 14 that is likely to be postponed because of the disaster.
Reuters said that the anger over the delay in providing aid and starting the rescue work could affect the election.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge to Erdoğan's 20-year rule.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called "negative campaigning for political gain."
The leader of Turkey's main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, criticized the government's response.
Critics said, "The earthquake was big, but what is more serious than the earthquake is the lack of coordination, lack of planning and incompetence.

Vietnam News Agency Hanoi – According to the report by the special envoy of Vietnam News Agency, during the visit to Brunei, on the morning of February 11, Nguyen Tan Dung, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD, abbreviated as “Brunei University”).
The University of Brunei Darussalam is the largest tertiary education and scientific research centre in Brunei and is ranked third among universities in the region.
The University of Brunei Darussalam is one of the symbols of Vietnam-Brunei cooperation in education and training.
In July 2013, the University of Brunei Darussalam officially established a cooperative relationship with Vietnam's FPT University, mainly in the field of English training.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, German, Japanese and Korean, the University of Brunei Darussalam has also included Vietnamese in its curriculum.
When visiting the University of Brunei Darussalam, the Prime Minister of Vietnam Nguyen Tan Dung and his wife had an exchange with students in the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh is delighted that more and more foreigners are interested in learning Vietnamese, thereby making a positive contribution to promoting Vietnamese cultural characteristics and local customs to the world.
The Prime Minister of the Government, Pham Minh Chinh, expressed his belief and hope that the team of Vietnamese language teachers at the University of Brunei Darussalam will become stronger and stronger; the students in the Vietnamese language class will become more and more interested in the Vietnamese language, strive to learn it, and be able to use fluent Vietnamese soon, and become messengers of friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei Darussalam.
Taking this opportunity, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also communicated with Vietnamese students studying English at FPT-UBD Global Center in Rach Gia City via video to learn about their study, especially during the pandemic.
According to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, the cooperation between Vietnam's FPT University and the University of Brunei Darussalam, especially the FPT-UBD Global Center, is a vivid symbol of the cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei in education.
At the same time, I hope that the students of the center will make greater progress in their studies and make positive contributions to the friendly and cooperative relations between Vietnam and the two countries.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly appreciated the outcomes of education cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei, including the cooperation between FPT University and Brunei University, and the initiative of Brunei University to include Vietnamese language in the curriculum, during his talks with the Minister of Education of Brunei and leaders of Brunei University.
Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha hopes that the University of Brunei Darussalam will continue to pay attention to ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expand the scale of Vietnamese language classes.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung also highly appreciated the positive results of cooperation between the two countries on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding on Educational Cooperation signed in April 2014; he suggested that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs, such as the Global Discovery Programme and the Discovery Year.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly appreciated the establishment of the first branch of the University of Brunei Darussalam in Vietnam; believes that the university has an increasingly strong scale of development in the region and the world; and further expand cooperation relations with Vietnamese higher education institutions.
On this occasion, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and his wife planted a commemorative tree in the campus of the University of Brunei Darussalam and left a message in the commemorative book.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha wished that the University of Brunei Darussalam would continue to develop and contribute more and more power to the education cause of Brunei, and develop deeper and broader cooperation with educational and training institutions in Vietnam.

What was the "object" shot down over Alaska?
Confusing and full of guesses.
On Friday afternoon (February 10), the US military again used the most advanced stealth fighter F-22 of the United States to shoot down an unidentified object flying in the sky of Alaska, USA.
The crash site is 10 miles from the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that the US military has shot down an airborne object.
On Saturday, a Chinese spy balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina in US airspace after drifting across the country for several days.
The Pentagon said the second object, which entered U.S. airspace for the first time on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), about the size of a small car, much smaller than the previous Chinese spy balloon.
The Pentagon also believes that there is no indication that the object is maneuverable.
John Carlin, strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council at the White House, said on Friday that while it was not clear what the object flying at high altitude looked like, it posed a "reasonable threat" to the safety of civilian aircraft.
Kobe said that the object was different from the spy balloon found in the United States, as it did not have a "payload" hanging from it.
Kobe said, "We call it an 'object' because that's the best description we have at the moment."
President Biden listened to advice from the Pentagon before ordering the object to be shot down, and he made the decision "with great care," Cobie added.
The official description of the object in the United States can be roughly summarized as follows: it is the size of a small car, has no joystick, no suspension system, and flies at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.
But this information still does not answer fundamental questions, such as what the object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is carrying out.
Many online analyses and speculations suggest that it could be another Chinese balloon.
It may have come from China, like the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, performing some sort of mission in different locations.
Some also linked the "object" in Alaska with "unidentified flying objects" (UFOs).
A report by U.S. News & World Report quoted former U.S. Congressman Peter Meijer, who tweeted on Friday, “I really hope this ‘unidentified flying object’ is a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO.”
"The irony of lumping alien spacecraft in with weather balloons is surprising, but it's not worth sparking an intergalactic conflict over," Meijer said.
Mejia tweeted shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said that it was not just Mejia who suspected the object was a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett criticized the government's cover-up of intelligence last month, demanding that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) publish a report on "unidentified flying objects."
Amazon's customer service attitude is hard to believe
I don't think anyone's watching this, but I'll say it anyway.
When we bought it, it was a zip-up hoodie, and it ended up being a short-sleeved one for me.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer service. At that time, it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock, and I requested to exchange the goods. The customer service said they would solve it, and then I immediately saw that the name of the goods had been changed to short-sleeved, and the link I bought had been taken off the shelf.
The customer service then informed me that I could either keep the goods and receive a certain amount of compensation, or return the goods.
Is that how Amazon operates?
It's really hard to believe. It's not my problem that the clothes were sent wrong. As a consumer, I want to get what I paid for, and I didn't make any outrageous demands. Amazon changed the name and said it was out of stock.
This is my first long review, I hope this is not my last one.
Sleeves that are incomprehensible
It is said to be made of cowhide, and it is indeed quite hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks on it, and it is not clear whether it is real leather or not. Besides, the sleeves of this coat are really incomprehensible. The sleeves of a jacket are usually longer than a dress, but usually only 1-2 cm, and this coat is as long as 5 cm. The arms should naturally hang down at the position of the mouth of the tiger on the palm, but the sleeves of this coat cover the fingers.
It's easy to buy clothes, and it's easy to return them.
But when will the money be refunded?
The workmanship of the clothes is good, but because the size is too small, I have to return the clothes, but after returning the clothes, it has been more than a week, and I have not received the refund yet?
And you have to contact the dishonest FedEx yourself, which is the worst shopping experience since I bought items from Amazon!
However, the store was good and actively cooperated in urging the courier to refund the money in time. However, the work of Full Peak Courier was really angry, and it took about half a month to refund the money. This kind of partner wants to pull Amazon's legs. The work efficiency is poor, and there is no service awareness!
More suitable for young people
Killing in 99 seconds.
The workmanship, color, and feel of the sweatpants are all good, they are soft/thin enough, and they don't smell of kerosene.
Unfortunately, the model belongs to the slim type, which is more suitable for young people.
3XL, flat waist circumference 2 feet 5 inches, maximum stretch size 4 feet, 1.79/80 kilograms, the waist is a little tight.
There doesn't seem to be a drawstring at the waist, and it's a bit difficult to loosen the waistband.
Besides, it's uncomfortable to wear something so tight-fitting.
It's good. The color isn't very bright.
I just bought it and it went up by more than 200 yuan. What’s going on?
The first time Amazon used the cooperative delivery company, the first delivery was not at home; later, they proactively arranged two delivery times with the delivery person, but the delivery person still did not deliver the package; later, they directly refunded the package, and this unscrupulous delivery person did not have any integrity; I strongly recommend that you do not use the bad delivery company again.
This time, they also gave me a refund for a T-shirt and raised the price by more than 100 yuan.
Amazon should not sell its own products like this
Buy the product at a special price, the price is not low, and the comments are also very good.
When I received the product, I was stunned. The surface of the commodity was damaged in a large area, and there were damages in many other places. It was not a substandard product, but an old one. I will upload a picture later.
I applied for a refund, and the person from the factory said that it was caused by transportation after seeing the picture, isn't that nonsense?
How could there be wear and tear inside a commodity?
There are only two possibilities: either the goods are substandard or I deliberately damaged the goods and then returned them.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I have not damaged the goods, but according to my shopping record on Amazon, I think such goods should not appear in Amazon's self-owned goods, customers choose Amazon's self-owned goods is to trust, customer win, we win, the customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory, I hope everyone can work together to improve, thank you.
I have used this product for less than a year, and there are two E2, I don't know how to deal with it?
I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but two sets of red E2 appeared on the right side of the receiver in March 2016. It should be a problem with the transmitting module, right? This is not consistent with what was said on the Amazon website that the transmitting module can work for 7 years. I also can't find after-sales service on the Amazon website. What should I do?
Alright.
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn't feel new.
The label on the box was torn, and the label on the body was broken.
And it always goes blank.
It was better after the change.
The exchange is pretty fast, it's a bit blurry at night, and the field of view isn't very wide, but it's good enough for everyday use.
The disadvantage is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and the other is that I bought a phone on Amazon before.
There will be a sticker on the packaging to prevent the packaging from being opened, which was not the case this time; there was a sticker similar to the one for sticking on the warranty card when I bought the phone, which was not the case this time.
I don't know if it's cheaper, so I'm confused.
Wait for the supplier to respond
There was no label on the packaging, so I called the supplier directly and said that it was a genuine product with no label. If you have any doubts, you can send it to Johnson & Johnson for verification using the scraps on the edges and corners. Leave your license plate number and phone number, and I promise to send you a text message to inform you that I have entered your information into the warranty card on the Johnson & Johnson website. Have you received the text message yet?
I received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's self-produced goods are also very reassuring.
The mechanic who changed the oil said that the oil was clear and that it was good oil.
Because it was the second purchase.
So I am still very confident.
The courier is fast, the package is not picky, and the sound of the engine has decreased significantly after using this oil.
It is good value for money, and it is difficult to find synthetic engine oil for less than 200.
Support Star Crown, support winning cards, and effectively protect the car.
Japanese Amazon caused serious damage to the interests of buyers due to customer service problems (shipping a 8cm hairy caterpillar as a 8c hairy caterpillar) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)
Admitted the mistake, but kept shifting the blame, and always emphasized that the goods belonged to the third party and could not bind the third party.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
I originally purchased the page size options of 7c, 8, and 9c. At that time, I felt that this was a trap. I called the Chinese customer service of JD.com and clearly informed them that 8 was 8c. However, after the goods were returned to China, I found that there were only 8cm. I feel that this is a trap deliberately set up to cheat Chinese people (according to the after-sales service of Amazon). Now, this option is no longer available when viewing the page.
Chinese customer service: I am sorry for causing you losses; we offer you two options:
1. If you return the item, the buyer will bear all the shipping fees.
2. If you do not return the item, we will compensate you with 1,000 yen.
(I’ll do the math, the shoes are more than 4,000 yen, equivalent to 200rmb, choose 1, I don’t have shoes, the loss is 200 yuan.
Choose 2, I have shoes, and finally compensated me 2000 yen, and the final loss is 150rmb Customer service: We have recorded it, we will deal with it seriously, the next day returned the letter, saying that I do not accept the mediation of Chinese customer service, and then it was over.
I proposed: when the purchase page is 7c, 8, 9c, which is an option that is misleading, the Chinese customer service helped me say that the commonly used code in Japan is not like this, such as 140, but have you gone to other mosquito pages to see?
There are some cases where there are both JIS codes and non-JIS codes mixed together.
Besides, why did you put the 8cm in the middle between 7c and 9c, which is the smallest size, what’s the point of putting it there.
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know if you want to send it back to your country, so we won't reimburse your shipping fee.
I don’t understand this logic again; I am Japanese, and I still need Chinese customer service; Chinese who live in Japan don’t need Chinese customer service; tourists who come to Japan don’t need Chinese customer service; international long-distance calls are expensive, so the question is, who needs to call the Chinese customer service of Amazon Global Sourcing; it’s just like me, a Japanese buyer of Amazon Global Sourcing.
Aren't Amazon's Chinese customer service representatives just convenient for those of us who do overseas shopping?
I was not very satisfied with this purchase.
This is the second time I have purchased BABYLUCK diapers from Amazon. I bought a box when my baby was 2 months old. I chose the diapers made of imported paper from Europe. I was quite satisfied with my first purchase experience. My baby used one diaper throughout the night. It is true that it can satisfy 12 hours without changing diapers.
However, when I bought L-brand diapers this time, there were two packages in one box, and when I opened it, I found that the paper was relatively soft, and there was a clear difference between it and the imported Pampers; it was still okay, and there were no signs of leaks or rashes.
However, when the second pack of diapers was used, red rashes immediately appeared on the inner side of the baby's thighs, and they have not faded away until now.
I suspected the two bags in one box, and the quality was not the same.
I won't buy it again in the future!
Wish to pay attention to the transportation protection of the parcel
This is the worst packaging and transportation I have ever seen after so many years of online shopping. There is absolutely no protective measure, such as cushioning foam, buffer layer materials, and so on.
Just one crushed box.
And the soft rubber box packaging inside, the card box was crushed and deformed.
I hope it is genuine and the quality is guaranteed. I won't dare to buy things from Amazon in the future.
I would rather pay more than half the price at home, with a guarantee.
Moreover, the packaging of commodity products is a problem, and I saw that people commented on it in 2016, and it still looks the same now, 19 years later.
This shows that Amazon does not care about service feedback at all, which is far different from JD and Tmall in China.
Beautiful, but a bit disappointing
I really like the color of the whole cup, which is orange-red. Although my family is a man's family, I still think that orange-red and yellow are eye-catching.
It's smaller than I imagined, but it's still acceptable since it's meant to be taken out of the house.
I took it home last night and tried it out. After opening the bottle cap, the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the straw is positioned vertically, my son always has to hold the bump on the cap while drinking, so I think this part could be improved.
It seems that the straw cups of other brands are tilted so that the straws are inclined, which is reasonable. Children's things really care about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and large capacity
I like that it is lightweight and has a large opening, but the two separate compartments seem a bit excessive to me, and I don’t know what to put in them.
When I finished shopping, I found that there was another one of a different brand that was very similar for less than 200 yuan.
Counterfeit goods. Fake goods are particularly bad.
Amazon sells counterfeit goods, and I have been fooled.
The customer service said I couldn't return it because I had used it, and I didn't know it was fake.
Because of trust, I am sad, after all, it is a makeup remover, so go to a real store and buy it, please.
Because it was a flash sale, I didn't read the comments, and I have already submitted the e-commerce platform to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce; let's fight for our rights together.
Broken?
Fake goods?
In short, a tragedy.
I chose the one with fine pores when using the second sheet, but there was a strange smell as soon as I opened it. I thought it was normal because I had never used this product before. When I put it on my face, I couldn't stand it at all. It had a strong smell that couldn't be described, and I coughed as soon as I inhaled the smell. My eyes also hurt, and tears flowed out. I immediately took it off and washed my face.
I didn't believe it, so I opened another bottle of the same brand, which didn't have such a strong smell, and I'm using it now.
It reminded me of the smell of bad hair dye in a salon.
It's hard to imagine that Amazon's own-brand skincare products will have to be avoided from now on?
Scoundrels.
At the time of purchase, the activity page said that when you spend 99 yuan, you will get the “Three-Body Universe” for free. When I received the goods, there was no such gift, and when I called customer service, I was told to show them the screenshot of the activity at that time. The problem is that whoever buys things saves webpage screenshots, and you need customers to help you provide them. Buyers, please be careful next time and save evidence.
Feel it later
The first time I bought something on Amazon, I felt a few things, let's talk about the feeling of using up the commodity first, the first one is really painless, and there is no stimulating taste; overall, it's pretty good; it takes about 8 minutes to wipe off, and there will be a small amount of sweat debris on it; if you don't look closely, you won't be able to see it; so overall, it's pretty good; as for the rest, I will continue to observe and use it to see if it's good.
In any case, I think this stuff is really good.
I placed the second order on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th, which took a total of 15 days or half a month, and the delivery staff of Amazon were also very nice.
Thirdly, don’t believe in Amazon’s Black Friday. Just place an order on Friday, and it will be cheaper by nearly 12 yuan after 2 days. That is, I bought it for more than 170 yuan (including shipping fee and so on), and there is a feeling that they will raise the price if they hold an activity.
The customer service said that the price fluctuated, and I paid attention to it for more than 10 days, and the price was just like this, and the fluctuation was not big.
Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, with granules, and absolutely refundable!
The toothpaste with grains in it is refreshing, and your teeth feel smooth after using it. Compared to some other toothpastes, this one is much better. It says it’s imported, but many of the products don’t have Chinese labels, so I don’t know where they’re sourced from.
In the future, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to second-hand things again.
I have a suggestion. Sometimes the reviews are not posted on the Amazon app. I hope the app can be improved, and it will get better and better!
Over the years, Excellent has become worse and worse, and there is no quality of service to speak of!
Garbage Excellent does not care about customer needs, and the special delivery time for placing an order is from 19:00 to 22:00.
Because there is an elderly person at home who is unable to get out of bed after surgery, delivery can only be made in the evening.
As a result, it was directly delivered at 12 o'clock noon, and there was no telephone notification in advance.
If the delivery time is at the discretion of your courier, why do you have to pretend to have a schedule for customers to choose from?
If your own logistics can't guarantee the service, then don't be an e-commerce retailer!
An elderly man with three wounds on his body had to get out of bed to open the door to receive the parcel, and he had to find some spare change to pay for it!
There was a phone number on the order!
No one even called to give an explanation!
The so-called complaint customer service of Excellent Network is a group of people from outside who pretend to be there and placate your complaint and then give you a so-called response.
There will be no change or compensation!
I had encountered similar problems with the delivery time before, so I just put up with it, but this time I couldn't put up with it, it was too much!
The pre-sale of the new book was delivered, but the front and back covers were the wrong way round, so it was obviously a quality problem, so I sent the book to the customer with my eyes closed?
No one will contact you if you leave a comment or a bad review.
Over the years, Excellent has become worse and worse, and there is no quality of service to speak of!
I won't spend another penny on Excellence.
The picture quality is really unacceptable
As the title of “Ancient Map Collection”, this book is really hard to accept in terms of the selection of pictures, layout, and printing, and some pictures even have mosaic, which is blurred to the point of being unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small illustration, it should be worthy of the voluminous pre-modern Chinese literature left by our ancestors in the catalogue!
(And many of the images can be obtained from relevant industry resources in clear original documents.) What is the difference between compiling books with such images and not using images?
I feel sorry for this kind of learning spirit.
There is no comment on the text; each family has its own interpretation.
Overall 2 stars.
When I was in Grade 2, I only read this book because I was bored, and I didn't think I would get addicted to this kind of book since I wasn't interested in web novels in the past.
Then... he fell into a hole.
In terms of the plot, the whole book is quite light-hearted; when Ye Zhu was still in the online game, even though there were intrigues among the guilds, they were not at all heavy-handed because they were often killed by Ye Shen Dog.
As for the part of the game, it wrote a little bit of bitterness about the alternation of old and new changes of the times (probably because I am too sentimental).
I spent a lot of time studying this book in my second year of high school, but I just couldn't put it down.
The full-time description of characters and emotional lines is amazing, and some characters only appear occasionally, but they will leave a deep impression on people. Characters such as Ye Zhuang Huang Xiaotian Su Moqiong, who are described in detail, have a large number of fans, and characters who are not in the writing center, such as Jiang Bo Tianchu Yu Xiang, are also very popular. In a light novel about e-sports, it is hard to find a character that is extremely disliked. This is the success of full-time in character description.
In terms of the love line, the full-timers don’t have the problem of three thousand beauties in the harem, either beautiful or rotten, which is a common complaint about web novels; all the characters in the novel have one thing in common, which is that they like Honor of Kings, and most of them want a fair victory.
There are small conspiracies, but nothing big, and everyone seems so simple and adorable.
That may also be why there are no unlikable roles for full-timers.
The full-time IP is very large, and it is also due to this.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of web literature, Full-Time is a good book.
He will really give people some blood and a little bit of inspiration.
I became a full-time animator in April this year.
I’ve wanted to buy this set of books for a long time, but I never had enough money to buy them all at once, and then when I wanted to buy them, I found that there were too many counterfeits on TB, and in fact, the latest version of Full-time was just released. I really like the cover, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I just bought a set of them on Amazon.
Next, let's briefly talk about the goods.
● The fourth book is not shrink-wrapped, but the book is new.
●The seventeenth plastic-wrapped book was sealed, but it was opened, and the quality of the book felt strange and was not hard like the others.
● Same as the 23rd and 17th, but harder than the 17th, but very old.
● It seems that the publishers of a few books are different, such as the 23rd and 17th are the same publisher, and the others are different.
● Overall, I am satisfied. It is a big box with 24 books, which is very satisfying.
The Lonely Little Lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as The Lost City of Z, but there was a lot of text!
After reading it three times, I finally read the book to my little friends, a little lion that knows how to shoot, and a little lion that loves to eat fruit juice and candy.
When I saw the scene of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable, and modern urban people can't accept the arrangement of being eaten by animals.
In the end, the little lion, who had succeeded in human society, had lost himself; he was no longer entirely a lion, nor entirely human.
Finally, only the silhouette of the little lion is left, and I don't know where he went.
It is possible that the image of the little lion will remain in the memory of the grown-up little friends for many years to come, and will be recalled by chance one day, perhaps touching or inspiring her.
A very affordable collection of works
1, I didn’t know TASCHEN before, but I bought a lot of their books recently because they are so powerful, both in their choice of subjects and in their production.
There have been three versions of this work, the largest of which is almost 50 cm long and 34 cm wide, just like the Michelangelo Complete Works; the medium-sized version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest and comes with a book box.
I think it is still acceptable. Firstly, the price is cheap, and it is divided into two volumes of more than 700 pages, which is good for browsing; secondly, it is different from the complete works of Michelangelo. The paintings occupy the main body, and the black and white manuscripts of Da Vinci occupy most of it. For readers with limited budget and non-art majors, this version is the best in terms of cost performance for appreciating the paintings and manuscripts.
2. The explanations for the paintings are great, with analysis of composition, drafts, and historical context (such as the Last Supper), but I don't know if it's a printing or book size issue, some parts of the shadows are too deep, and I can't see the details, which is a bit regrettable.
3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, the content of Da Vinci's manuscripts is much richer.
The former is already a genius, and the latter is too broad and too high to be described as a genius.
If you only looked at the paintings, you could only understand half of Da Vinci. After watching the manuscript, I was completely at a loss for words.
Garbage, whoever buys it will regret it!
Never give a bad review, this is really rubbish, I wasted money on it, it's crazy, give me a reason!
1. Do not walk, suddenly become January 1, and the time is reset to zero.
2. Poor quality straps, none of which are silicone, causing allergic reactions and blisters on the wrist.
3. Often can not connect to the phone.
4. Battery life is only five days.
5. Sleep detection is not displayed, and the time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Other.
Logistics is too slow
Showed on October 16th, but the result was received on October 21st, and it was a bad review!
The delivery is too bad. I thought it would be slow to buy things on Amazon, but I didn't expect it to be so slow!
Overall Satisfaction
At the beginning, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was fine, and there was an inflatable bag inside. The camera was consistent with the three codes, and I could also register it on the official website. The shutter speed was 0, and I could only wait for the time to test the others.
The shipping speed is also pretty fast. Here, I want to complain about the delivery guy. Valuable items were left in the lobby, and he was so fast that I couldn’t open the package in front of him. I was speechless.
The seller thought of the customer before shipping:)
The merchants are more responsible, and they specially call to ask about the screen size of the camera used, which is really thoughtful for customers.
Shipping speed is also fast.
The diamond film sticker is also quite suitable and useful.
Battery is not fully charged
The machine is really good, I want to ask how come the first time I charged it, it was not fully charged, and the charging indicator light was always red
Currently, there is no official feedback channel for Amazon, so you can only give feedback in the product reviews.
1. On March 29, the book was purchased for 31 yuan through pre-purchase, and it was shown that the book would be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book could not be previewed on the Amazon official website (because it had not been published yet);
2. On March 31, the book was pushed to the device, and the content was blank, with only “please look forward to it”, while the electronic version of the book was reduced to 18 yuan on Amazon;
3. Over the past two days, I have repeatedly tried to delete the blank book downloaded on the device and synchronize it again, but I still cannot get the electronic version of The Nature of Business, which contains the actual content, but I can preview the book on the official website of Amazon.
I have a few thoughts at the moment.
1. The issue of price is not the most important one. The key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books with actual content now, instead of always being “please wait” when downloading.
2. You won’t be able to buy the pre-purchased book later; after all, if you skip the book, you’ll have to download a book with empty content, and the process seems very complicated;
3. I hope Amazon will provide a normal channel to feedback such problems. When there are doubts about downloading or using e-books, there should be a place to feedback (work order, online customer service, etc. You can refer to how Microsoft official store does it).
Not Recommended Reading
I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to come across it. I'll write a review based on my memory.
Rather than a collection of short stories, this book is a collection of fragments of life about love.
The tone of the book is extremely plain, like plain water, and the choice of words and phrases is perfect for the pursuit of simplicity, and the plot is as quiet and plain as a street in the afternoon of a summer day.
Each short story is a fragment of time from an ordinary life, without a beginning or an end.
They were eventually collected and published under the title What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.
I think that this collection of short stories, as well as its title, is a kind of performance art. The author wants to express that love is not only the joys and sorrows on the stage, but also the cliches in urban legends. Love is not only the glue that binds people together, but also the fact that love should not be represented by the above, and love is also the mundane life, the monotonous day after day, as well as the helplessness in life, the escape from reality, and the confusion about the future.
As you read this book, you may remember the quarrelling couples around you, the boring marriages of people you know, and the unsatisfactory relationships.
This is the reason why I do not recommend reading it; from the aesthetic point of view, the writing style and plot of the book are tasteless, unless your life is full of storms or sweet like living in a candy castle; otherwise, you will feel bored and indifferent when reading it.
And in terms of depth of thought, the everyday plot doesn't offer anything new or expand anyone's mind or vision (unlike Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the brief segments don't explore any issues, such as what kind of mistake led to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't matter whether you read it or not.
The author's ideas are more expressed through techniques and forms rather than story plots, which is also the reason for the poor reading experience of this book.
It is suitable for rough reading and cannot be read in detail.
The logic of the book is good, but the content is not rich enough.
It explained what many sales theories are and why, but it was weak in terms of how to do it; it only pointed out the direction but did not provide specific practices.
Also, the book feels like it was cobbled together.
For example, there are both domestic and foreign examples; there are both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and people who are not well-known.
I don't know if it's a story compiled as an example, and if some cases experienced by the authors would be more convincing.
The term "customer" is used interchangeably with "client".
The title is still the customer, but in the main text it becomes the customer.
There were also typos, missing punctuation, and numbering errors in the e-books.
All in all, this book is a good choice as an introduction to the theory, but it is not suitable for people who are already engaged in sales and want to improve their sales level.
Quickly understand the introduction book of Internet finance
This book is very shallow, and can be said to be just an introductory course. It can help you quickly understand the overall picture of Internet finance, but if you want to understand it in-depth, you still have to dig it out by yourself.
The book was written earlier, and the later Alipay and WeChat subsidy war to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned, and now the proportion of third-party payments is probably not as small as the proportion mentioned in the book.
Nowadays, many people take their mobile phones with them when they go out to eat, and merchants have abandoned UnionPay due to the high bank transaction volume.
However, I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least several years of financial observation experience and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, which is why the content is so simple and easy to understand.
It's easy to write loftily, but it's difficult to write in a way that is easy to understand.
I appreciate you, and I want you to know it!
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they are given enough attention and appreciation in their work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, after the basic survival needs of human beings are satisfied, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs—the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them “love you in their hearts but can’t express it”, even if they have love, gratitude and appreciation, they will keep it to themselves and won’t say it out loud.
In this book, the author describes five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, acts of service, quality time, tangible gifts, and physical touch.
I think what’s important is not what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use these five languages of appreciation from the bottom of your heart, anytime, anywhere, to appreciate and be grateful to the people around you, whether they are family members, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the more intimate people are, the more they need appreciation and gratitude, so that our lives can become more beautiful.
Learn to appreciate, and enterprises can also retain talents to a certain extent and reduce the turnover rate.
Thanks to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and the world.
Due to reasons such as the cultural background of the East and the West, there will be differences between languages, and if you have the opportunity to see the original version of the author, I believe you will gain more.
Thanks again to the authors, translators, and editors for their hard work!
Suspected counterfeit goods, please Amazon strictly review
The quality is terrible, the packaging is dilapidated, there is no weight, and it is not even better than the products on the roadside stalls; there is no net weight, there is no bar code, and the packaging of ten bags is dilapidated; it is completely not the feature of qualified products; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, and I have applied for a refund; it is completely a quality problem; it is recommended that the merchant wake up and refuse inferior goods; supplement: I also bought holographic stamps, 23 yuan / 10 books in the supermarket, and added a few pictures for comparison to further verify the poor quality of this product; in order to give consumers a more clear reference, avoid economic losses and further unhappiness!
Once again, we hope that Amazon can be scrupulous and keep a close eye on the source of the products.
Products are hastily made, and there is a gap between expectations and reality
Advantages:
1. Big brand, cheap price.
Advantage 2: The motor and blade are both guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are OK to use, but they are not as good as I expected.
Disadvantages:
1. Charging has no indicator light. This is the most basic thing. You have saved on the power indicator. I estimate that customers who buy a product for 300 yuan are a waste and have no respect in the eyes of Panasonic.
2. Strong odor. Even if you only charge it for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong odor of burning plastic.
I tried the office for one day, and the whole room smelled like plastic.
Compared with the Philips PHILIPS of the same price that I have used before, although it has one more blade, the Samsung product is really not up to the consumers’ expectations in terms of quality.
Small package
When I received the parcel, I saw that the e-commerce version was written on it, and I knew that I had been cheated again. It was much smaller than the one I bought at the supermarket. It should be size M. The packaging was different from the picture on the product introduction. It was the new version, I guess.
The three stars are blaming themselves for being careless and not looking at the specifications of the commodity; when you sell the M-sized e-commerce version to me, I have no complaints; what do you mean by “the wrong version”?
The tricks of e-commerce are too deep, so I still go to the supermarket when I have time.
The sauce is purple.
I don't like the taste.
Kids don't like the taste of toothpaste, and they always say it's spicy. Maybe there's a better word to describe it, but for now, that's the only word in the kid's vocabulary.
I bought it when I was organizing the event, and it was very cheap, so I'm sorry to give it a bad review; it's four stars, but I won't be buying it again.
It's genuine and well packaged.
The packaging is complete, with an inflatable bag inside, and there are no online reviews except for the appearance of a single product.
The outer packaging of the bottle also had a plastic film, just like the one described in the picture, and the delivery was very fast, arriving the day after I ordered it.
It's genuine, but it's out of stock, and I don't know when it will be back in stock.
A terrible shopping experience
I placed an order on Black Friday, but it took a long time to receive it. After checking, the parcel had been signed for, but none of my colleagues had signed for it. I immediately contacted the courier company, but they said that they could only initiate an inquiry after the recipient signed for it. I contacted Amazon customer service, and I had to wait for more than ten days. Finally, I found out that the courier had been wrongly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of exchanges, I finally picked up the courier, but the outer package had been opened, and the goods were still intact, but I don't know if they had been used. In short, it was a bad experience.
Wrong picture
I thought I could receive earphones like the one in Picture 1, but I received earphones like the one in Picture 2. It doesn't matter that the pictures are inconsistent. What does it mean that the left and right earphones have different volumes?
Although the names are the same, we still hope that everyone can pay attention, and we also hope that the person in charge of Amazon will replace the correct picture in a timely manner. Thank you very much.
The operating system is generally good.
After using it for a while, the overall picture is still good, and I don't feel any difference; however, this system makes me feel confused, the boot time is obviously slow, and I can't set it up well; the software that comes with it doesn't need to be commented on; the response speed is even worse; it's not on the same level as my colleague's.
According to the comments, the design is very humanized, but I couldn't find where it is humanized; the location of the remote control's commonly used up, down, left, and right buttons and the back button is really not commendable.
So, let's be a TV, and add a TV box and so on.
The price drop is too much.
The price drop is too much, from 100 yuan to 99 yuan now!
I accumulated a lot of unrated orders on Amazon, so I unified them with a copy of a comment.
If I use this sentence to evaluate, it means that this product is at least 85 points.
For the inferior products, I would never be lazy to copy and paste the reviews, so that other consumers can refer to them when purchasing, and merchants can improve the quality of their products as a result.
Cheap good wires, that's enough if you don't get a fever!
This is a very cheap line, but it should meet the HDMI certification standard. I personally compared it with the inferior products in Akihabara in China (the price is twice as expensive), and the line is thick and soft. The transmission of 7 meters has no noise, and in the future, I will choose Besee for low-priced lines!
The east and west are okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites
After placing the order, I found out that I made a mistake, but the order cannot be canceled, and the webpage for contacting online customer service always shows an error link and cannot be contacted.
After I received the package, the delivery person called me and I said I didn’t want it anymore, but I couldn’t cancel the order, so the delivery person took it back and asked me to sign for it, and then I could apply for a refund.
It was only when I applied for a refund that I was informed that food items cannot be returned once they have been signed for, and I couldn't call Amazon customer service, which said the same thing, that food items cannot be returned once they have been signed for.
I have bought non-refundable items in Jingdong and Suning before, including milk and diapers, and I contacted customer service and they refunded me, and Jingdong’s diapers smell too much when opened, and I contacted customer service and they still refunded me, but it’s not the same with Amazon.
Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it?
Tell me either I pick it up myself, or let the delivery person buy it, it is not easy for the delivery person, why should I let the delivery person spend money to buy something that I did not buy myself?
Okay, I won't back out either. I'll take it myself, but I have to give your service one point.
I advise you not to waste your money.
First, I was full of expectations when I bought it, and I thought that the Dali brand should not be bad at all, and after receiving it, I felt that the packaging was still good, the size was not bad, but there was one box that was basically soft, which could not be seen from the appearance, and you could feel it; when I put it in my mouth, there was no taste at all, it was tasteless and tasteless, and when I bit it open, the fruit peel was dark yellow, which meant it was bad, and the good and bad ones were sold together; only about one third of them could be eaten, and I advised you not to buy it, and it was not cheap, and the quality was too bad!
After this experience, I will never buy fruit from an e-commerce platform again!
Where is the product anti-counterfeiting mark?
The corner of the bottom of the bottle is deeply concave, which should be caused by a strong impact; from the outer packaging bag, the degree of devastation is heartbreaking; after all, the packaging of this kind of food is too simple, and it belongs to International Purchase; have you seen any obvious anti-counterfeiting identification marks; it is very easy to open the bottle; the most important thing is that the layer of honey inside the lid is directly blown out; there is almost no adhesion; is this the case with foreign products?
I was born in China, so I don't quite understand.
It should be genuine, right?
There was also a reminder sent on the 21st, and I received it on the 14th. This is the first time I have made an overseas purchase here, and I just wanted to write down my doubts. Maybe this is all normal?
Pick-up service needs improvement
I bought a total of 5 vouchers, and when I withdrew them, I made an appointment for the first time to withdraw 3 vouchers, but only 2 were sent, and after communicating with many people, it was confirmed that they were lost, and they promised to send them again; the second time I made an appointment, it just happened to be a holiday, and neither the website nor WeChat reminded me that I needed to make an appointment on a working day, which caused unnecessary panic, and I suggest that it should be improved in the future.
Good shopping
Praise for the east and west!
I still believe in Amazon's self-produced products, and now it's very convenient to shop overseas. The delivery time from abroad is only a few days longer than that of domestic delivery. I have to say that Amazon's ability to clear customs for overseas purchases in China is still very strong. It's much faster than going through transshipment, so now I buy a lot of things on Amazon Overseas.
I hope that the quality and price of domestic commodities can be better, many things are made in China, but it is cheaper to buy them back after going out, I hope it can be improved.
Garbage
When you see a package like this, do you think it's garbage on the side of the road?
A plastic packaging that is easy to break, comes from so-called Germany in a plastic bag, is this kind of packaging responsible?
I think this kind of packaging is the same as garbage packaging. When I bought this product, the packaging was very simple, and there were no measures to prevent it from being damaged. It was just a simple plastic bag packaging. When I received it, the package was completely deformed, and the items inside were also damaged.
If I had just run into one of these, I would have bought a few of them, contacted Amazon customer service, and they would have said that I could return them, but I would have to pay the shipping fee up front, and then the shipping fee would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.
I asked, if I pay the shipping fee with cash, will you give me a gift card, which means I have to buy your gift card myself, and I also have to mail the product to your warehouse in Germany, which is like buying a product and being punished for it!
But I always say to the customer service that who is responsible for this kind of problem, and the customer service doesn't dare to say that it is their responsibility even for a half sentence, and they don't dare to take responsibility even for a half sentence, so what kind of after-sales service do they have? One sentence: I give up! But I estimate that Amazon won't give me a chance to publish this review, and they will directly delete it!
Quality is good 5 stars, logistics is bad
1, the quality is good, it is a bargain, the price is reasonable, and it is worth it.
2, solid, enough material, firm welding point, good surface treatment, good color.
3, logistics is a hard problem, the order placed on the 3rd arrived on the 11th.
4, If Amazon had not marked the estimated delivery time as February 7, I might have been satisfied.
5. However, if the expected delivery time is marked, it is equivalent to a commitment to the user, and it is difficult for the user to accept when the commitment cannot be fulfilled.
6, if you do not have the confidence to make a commitment, please do not make a commitment.
7, in fact, I am very concerned about the commitment made by merchants.
8, so I got a low score.
The gold wire will turn black.
The effect is there, but whether it is obvious or not depends on the individual, or the psychological effect.
There is one thing that is not so good, which is the gold wire. Originally, it was designed to look good, but in fact, the gold wire will fade, and if you touch it a few times on the car, there will be some gold powder on your hand and on the car.
I hope the product can be improved.
There is no decoration effect on this square one, so don't put gold wire on it, and it is troublesome to drop it on the car and make the car dirty.
East and west are good, speed is good, divided into 2 packages and different packaging
The speed is quite fast in 8 days, but there are 2 parcels in 2 parcels, and the packaging is different, obviously one is more shock-resistant than the other, with thick cardboard and a layer of plastic, and the outer packaging is easy to take apart, like a domestic delivery box, with a few buffer airbags, and it feels a bit superficial.
Yalan mattress is really good.
The mattress is 34 cm thick, so you don’t need to sleep directly on the mattress.
The quality is good, whether it is the front or the back, it is very soft, sleeping is very comfortable, and I fall asleep very quickly when I lie on it.
After receiving the mattress, there were some stains on it due to violent transportation by the courier. Yalan customer service was responsible and efficient in contacting me to solve the problem.
Not self-produced goods, Amazon is shameless
The page is clearly labeled self-owned, but in fact, it is delivered by the supplier, and the after-sales service is provided by the supplier, and if there is a problem, you need to contact the supplier yourself.
If you want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been transmitted to the supplier and cannot be canceled; if you want to return or exchange the goods, you have successfully applied for return or exchange on Amazon, sorry, no one can help you, and you need to contact the supplier yourself to return the goods.
This is Nima's self-produced commodity.
The commodity is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not bear the after-sales service; the customer service said “I will contact the supplier for you”; it even claimed that it was self-owned, which is too shameless; it is naked-faced and naked-faced fraud against consumers!
Frustrating experience
Previously, I bought a filter cartridge for online shopping from another store, and the filtering effect was good, and I didn't have limescale for another two days after the 28 days were over.
Because the quality of things purchased on Amazon has always been good, this time I thought I would buy it here. I bought the filter for the first time on Amazon, and it didn't feel good. Not only did it start to have water stains early on, but the filter lasted until day 28, and there were suspended small black carbon powder. I didn't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. It was very frustrating.
Not as good as I imagined.
Compared with the plugboards I have used in the past, the external workmanship is general, and I hope the internal workmanship is good if I don't disassemble it; whether each independent unit is electrified is lack of display from the convenience of use.
The packaging was damaged, and I would have to wait to test the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is severely damaged, and the packaging box inside seems to be new, but the manual does not seem to be new, and it was renovated in September. It is a stockpile. I hope it will not be bad when it arrives. Please explain to me why several customers mentioned that the packaging was damaged, but you were not affected. Thank you!
Pretty good overall, a few minor issues
The first time I bought a water filter, after reading a few reviews, I felt that LAICA's cost performance was relatively high, so I chose this one. After receiving the goods, I installed the filter cartridge according to the instructions, tried it out, and felt that it was generally good, but when pouring water, it seemed that the original water would mix with the treated water from the mouth of the kettle (the seal of the original water tank was not very tight).
Be sure to wait until all the water is filtered out before pouring it!
Image is incomplete
The picture did not capture the details of the side, and the details of the side did not match the style of the main body, and there was a big difference, which was one; this bead was made in Thailand and did not indicate the place of origin, which was two; it did not indicate the material, which was three; when I bought it in the UK, each item had its own box, but here there was only a simple plastic bag, and there was no product mark on the bead, so how could I judge whether it was genuine or fake.
Be careful what you buy, especially if it comes from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service is terrible.
I placed an order two days ago, and when I received it today, I found that the price had been reduced by 40 yuan. After spending a lot of time looking for customer service, the customer service said that they could not refund the price difference and that I could place a new order and return the product.
This kind of customer experience and service is really different from Taobao and Tmall.
Alright, for a beginner, it's a good place to start
The appearance is good, and it is not comparable to the top quality Jade Buddha. I saw the price in the shopping mall before; it was several hundred yuan. This is the first time I have played with Jade Buddha, and it is okay.
It's good value for money.
It was really good, I sent it to my girlfriend, but it was a little unpleasant when I was not in Canada at noon, and the courier company directly put the parcel in the deposit box and did not send me a verification text message to pick up the parcel, so I had to go there twice.
However, the baby is really good.
Worth buying
The little monkey is cute, and the Amazon discount is really big; Zhoushengsheng’s official website ships directly, and I placed an order last night, and I received it today afternoon, which is really fast.
The postman is also responsible.
Great!
A customer's confession
1 I received this substandard product, and Amazon customer service told me not to worry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then in the middle you contact the customer service staff, they will tell you that this problem will be handled by a specialist, and he will inform you of the result.
You can never get in touch with this commissioner on your own initiative, you do not know her work number, and there is no direct dial telephone, that is, you cannot get in touch with her, only she can get in touch with you.
Tragically, after nearly 3 days, the agent contacted me, but I left my phone and didn't receive the agent's call.
I waited for 2 hours and didn't receive the call from the specialist, so I contacted Amazon customer service and emailed the customer service to call me back.
4Almost 3 days have passed, and I still don't know what Amazon will do with this defective coffee maker I received!
5 There is no problem with the products of Amazon in the United States; this kind of shopping method is good for overseas purchases, but the service of Buy America is far worse.
6 For me, I can only continue to wait...
Bottom is uneven
Because the review said it was good, and everyone was looking forward to this pot, and when I got it, I liked it very much, it was very light, but when I opened it, I found a problem, the bottom of the pot was not flat, it was protruded in the middle, and recessed around it, and the oil ran to the surrounding area, and I specially bought a big fatty meat to open the pot, and a lot of oil could not be covered in the central area, damn, I could not open the pot at all, and I guess this structure could not be used for normal cooking.
I don't know if I'm just unlucky, but I just got a pot with an uneven bottom. Fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return policy, so I decided to return it.
I wiped the pot clean and put it away, having wasted half a day.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes
This is a product with a very simple design style.
The shape of the cube, the designer made the top slightly curved.
It should have been a very smooth line.
Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.
Because there are two parts at the top, the front is the control panel and the back is the water tank cover.
The curvature of the top cover and the curvature of the control panel were not consistent, resulting in a height difference of up to 2 mm after assembly.
Although it looks like a very small gap.
But it can be said to have destroyed the entire design.
I feel sorry for the product designer.
It seems that Midea's product managers are not capable of creating such a standard product.
(Of course, the feedback to the after-sales lady cannot be too high, but when I heard the after-sales say that all the individuals of this product are like this, and it is not only the one I bought that has problems, her disbelief and the sense of responsibility for the truth made me realize that I cannot ask too much for beauty.) 2019-7-7 The pump failed and the water flow was small. It has been repaired for the second time, and it was broken again two weeks after the first repair.
It's a bargain after the discount, Amazon's fake discount is heartbreaking
You can buy it a week after the baby is born, and it has excellent insulation.
You can't feel any heat on the outside of the pot, which means it won't burn you and also effectively prevents heat from escaping.
The air-conditioned room still maintained a high temperature after a whole night.
Amazon said the 320th anniversary was a big discount, but later found that everyone had 249, 289, and 299. I felt cheated for a moment, but when I went to the supermarket, I found that it was still cheaper than various brands at the same price, so I can bring it with me when I go out in the future.
Vitamix 6300
I have been waiting for a long time, and I saw that Meiya 6300 was discounted, and Xinya Overseas Purchase was the same price, so I bought it quickly.
I placed an order on September 2nd, and it was expected to arrive on September 21st. However, it arrived on September 12th, which was about 10 days in advance. The speed is really fast!
The packaging is small, and the original packaging of Vitamix is used directly, and Amazon is not afraid that it will be broken when it is shipped across the ocean!
The machine looks new, and the accessories are complete. The only problem is that the cup shakes a lot when it is placed on the base. I am even afraid that the cup will fly out when I turn it on!
I asked a friend who had 5200, and he said it didn't feel as loose as mine.
The accompanying recipes are all in English, which is quite tiring, and I couldn’t find a Chinese version online, what a hassle!
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer, and it should arrive in 3 days, so I will play around with it then!
It's too small, there's no umbrella cover, and the material is mediocre.
It's not an XL at all!
The second Totes, 1. There is no umbrella cover 2. The material of the umbrella handle is general 3. It is written as Large, but it is actually a convenient umbrella for one person, and two people will probably find it uncomfortable.
On the contrary, the one I bought from Meiya can be used by three people without any pressure.
I don't feel so good.
First of all, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms when you press on it with your fingers; secondly, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS scratches on the front of the box when it is laid flat; thirdly, the place where the handle is located is emphasized by a piece of cloth inside the box; and so on; there are many things that I am not satisfied with, such as the fact that the latch is not very smooth.
PS: The wheels feel pretty good.
You can also
Pros: This double-shoulder bag is quite refined and looks durable.
Disadvantages: the QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what are you doing?), the 15.6-inch notebook cannot be put in (is it possible to make it a little longer?), the double shoulder bag can be locked, but no lock is provided for the buyer, which is not service-oriented.
Pretty good overall, not sure if it's genuine leather
The overall feeling is okay, I don't know if it's genuine leather, so I can't judge it.
It can hold A4-sized documents, up to 80 pages thick, but it can't hold box-shaped objects that are too thick or too hard (it can't be deformed).
The package is soft, and the inner bag is divided in a humanized way, which is pretty good.
It's just that there's a small pebble at the bottom of the one I got, so I don't know if it's because I'm not a good person?
I was too lazy to go through the hassle of exchanging it back and forth, so I put up with it.
Overall, it's a four-star hotel, and it's worth it.
ForRoyal Global Hit Camera Strap DSLR Strap
This strap is designed to be more scientific, hanging on both shoulders, practical, and the camera is fixed and protected in front of the chest with soft materials, unlike other quick-shooters that use screws to fix the bottom of the camera to hurt the camera, and it is also very convenient to take off the camera.
Garbage after-sales
I bought a guitar a month and a half ago, and it’s missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me a customer service phone number. After multiple communications, the part still hasn’t arrived. What kind of efficiency is this?!
It is estimated that it will be more troublesome to repair after there is a problem, and I hope that friends who are good at after-sales service will take a detour; it is too troublesome!
Small flaws, nice sound
The headstock has a defect, it lacks a corner, it feels like a substandard product, and there are no gifts, but at this price it is already good, and the sound of the guitar is also good.
Alright, the first receipt.
It has been used for a long time, and it is generally good except that the bass cannot come out.
It's just that the workmanship is not as perfect as I imagined.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem with the product, and all the lights were flashing, so I couldn't use it.
I asked for an exchange, but it took three days for the goods to arrive in Shanghai, and they still haven't been delivered.
I couldn't get through to the delivery person.
The courier company said that they only had that contact information.
Amazon can't find where to complain.
I didn't ask for it, and in the case of a delayed delivery, I received a message saying that the delivery would be delayed for no apparent reason, as per my request.
Then it goes on to say something about transfers.
It was a terrible shopping experience, and I began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
I don't think I'll get it today either.
The adhesive is too weak, and it is not waterproof.
Although the Bluetooth connection is convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not coated; and the label adhesion is poor, it is not suitable for cable labeling at all, and it is very easy to fall off, so friends who buy it to organize cables need to pay attention.
The pen is okay, but the package is too simple, just a cardboard box, with no protective measures, and the box that holds the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent glue, and the glue is still on the box when you tear it off.
The 600 yuan item was treated like this, and it was a disappointing shopping experience.
However, the pen is not a problem.
I hope there will be more improvements on the packaging in the future!
In terms of quality, it is not as good as 925-25 when it comes to writing.
First, let me praise the excellent service of TNT every day, air freight, super fast, and the service attitude is also very good!
I've been using the 925-25 for a long time, it's great, and I just received the 925-85. The quality of the pen is great, and the design is beautiful. I gave it four stars because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, and there is a bit of wobbling when adjusting the length of the lead inside the cap. In my opinion, the 925-25 is more comfortable to use.
So I became an Amazon loyalist.
I bought it at a super-discounted price, but my child doesn't like it.
It had been opened, so I tried to apply for a refund, and they even came to pick it up for free.
That's amazing.
We do not encourage returns, but this is the only service of its kind in China.
It is hoped that it will not be abused.
In the future, I will buy books here.
Earphone distortion and noise
These headphones are really trash, I don't know if it's my ears or if these headphones really aren't as good as they used to be.
I bought a blue one two years ago on JD.com. The sound quality is good, there is no noise, and the bass is also good. I used it for more than two years and it broke. I plan to buy another one (urbeats). After all, it feels good.
I looked at one that was purple and it looked nice, but when I opened it today, it didn’t sound right. It was both loud and soft at the same time.
At first, I thought it was because of the sound effect of the song, so I didn't think much about it. After listening to it for half a day, I found that the problem was very serious. Not only was it out of tune, but the low-frequency effect was not as good as before, and there were some noises. Is it just me who bought this purple one that has this phenomenon? Or is the manufacturing technology of the headphones really not good now?
Quite a bad review, I'm disappointed.
I have to return it tomorrow.
PS looks good
This AV amplifier is complicated to set up, has a rough exterior, and generates a lot of heat.
Wait a while before commenting on the sound!
I just got the German version of the DN1080 on August 14. It looks poorly made.
1. Front panel, all knobs are made of plastic.
2. The back panel audio input jack and the speaker output terminals are of poor quality. Any 1000-2000 CD integrated amplifier is much better than this one.
3. The top cover is quite thin, and the transformer side is also concave, so I had to open the box and use my hands to restore it, and the top cover and front panel became loose.
4. The center of gravity of the whole machine is biased towards the transformer end, and it is awkward to move.
It feels like a SONY entry-level machine, just the workmanship, made in Malaysia.
I feel that Sony is much better at outsourcing production to China.
5. The machine is very hot, and when watching a movie in two channels for about 2 hours, the top cover is about 40-50 ℃ when touched by hand; I don’t know if the transformer is too large and generates a lot of heat.
Nowadays, most people use switching power supplies, and this idiot transformer probably weighs 4 kg.
Sony should have used a passive cooling fan inside the machine, but after opening the box, I only saw large aluminum heat sinks on the pipes.

I haven't opened it yet.
The battery is in use.
I'd like to dissect it and see what's inside.
Later, I thought that if I was disappointed when I opened it, it would be a waste of money; if I was satisfied when I opened it, it would be difficult to put it back in the box, and I wouldn’t enjoy using it.
Okay, even if Sony uses good batteries.
As for the detailed explanation of electricity, ordinary people will feel dizzy when they look at it.
I’m okay. I used to work in a mobile phone factory, so I’m half a battery engineer, except that I don’t understand circuits. I can handle it.
Delighted
I really had no idea what I was buying until I opened the package and felt it was genuine!
Finally, when I touched the earphone wire, I felt it was very flexible, and the quality was so good that I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ Music.
I was shocked, the sound quality was 3D surround!
I asked in a physical communication store, it is about 30 yuan, but it is not a famous brand, it is a random brand, so it is said that although this famous brand is 27 yuan, it is absolutely cost-effective and worth owning!
The worst online shopping experience
After placing an order on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped, but I still did not receive the goods until October 12.
I queried the status of my Amazon order, but the seller didn't provide a tracking number, so I couldn't find out where my order was.
So I sent an email to the seller to ask if he could provide the tracking number, but he didn’t reply for two days.
In desperation, I called the Amazon customer service, and the customer service told me the seller’s mobile phone number. I called the seller again, and after a few attempts, the call was connected, and I was informed that the parcel was lost, and I could have a new one sent to me immediately.
Although I was very angry, I didn't say much to the seller because I needed the computer urgently. I just asked him to send it to me as soon as possible.
As a result, I called the next day to ask if the shipment had been sent.
The seller said it hasn't arrived yet, and it won't arrive until this afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, and the seller said it would definitely be shipped, and it would be shipped after 5 or 6 o'clock in the afternoon, but when I called back at 7 o'clock in the evening, no one answered the phone.
On the third day morning, I called again and asked if the goods had been dispatched.
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said he didn't send it, and told me to order it from someone else if I was in a hurry, and that it would be sent in the afternoon if I could wait.
I can’t do that; I’ll have to wait a long time to order from someone else.
I can only ask the seller to send it as soon as possible.
After countless phone follow-ups, I finally received the computer on October 16.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because I bought it for someone else, so I'll add a comment later.
I bought it half a year ago and have only used it a few times. Now it has been damaged. Can I ask if it can be repaired?
Because there is a desktop computer, I haven't used it much since I bought it.
I only take it out of my suitcase when I'm on a business trip.
Recently, when I plugged in the power supply, it did not charge, and I had to use my left and right hands to support the charging port and the charging cable for a few seconds before it started charging.
I suspect that the interface contact is not good, and I don't know if it can be repaired now?
It is strongly recommended that Amazon stop using EMS!
The product is five stars, the logistics is one star, and the average is three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon wants to send EMS, which is unreliable in the industry; well, a computer is an expensive item after all!
The order after purchase showed that it was expected to be delivered on the 20th, so my family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four or five days to send from Xiamen to Fuzhou?
On the 22nd morning, I checked the logistics and it finally arrived in Fuzhou. I was going to receive it happily, but in the evening, without receiving any phone call or text message, I checked the logistics and found that it had been signed for at noon, and it even showed that I had signed for it myself!
I was shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Is this computer really mine?
I seriously doubt if life is worth living!
I finally ran to the pick-up point and brought the computer back.
The specific reason is simple, because the courier guy mixed up the two order numbers, and fortunately the package was not lost, so it's okay.
I strongly recommend Amazon not to use EMS, and I will never buy from Amazon again if Amazon uses EMS in the future.
The goods are not bad
First of all, I bought it a few days ago and found that it was reduced in price, and I left a bad comment. The product is still not bad, and it is cost-effective. The CPU and graphics card are enough to cope with mainstream online games and a considerable number of large single-player games. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a little dim (a common problem of IPS screen), the sound quality is not good, and the hard disk is not good (it is recommended to spend some money to add a solid-state hard disk). I took the hardware to the after-sales service center for testing yesterday, and there was no problem at all. The pre-installed Windows 8.1 is not good to use, and it is recommended to upgrade to 10. The seller sent the goods very quickly, and the answers to all my inquiries were also very quick. The invoice arrived the day after I received the computer, which is good. It is a pity that there are no gifts.
(By the way, if you want to buy keyboard skins, don’t go to taobao.com and buy from a store called E Cool Digital Center. The delivery is slow, the quality is poor, and if there is a problem with the product, they won’t refund or replace it. The boss even swears a lot. I’m exposing them.)
Goods and services are good, but the platform is still bureaucratic
The quality of the hard drive is very good, the price-performance ratio is absolutely high, it is cheaper than buying it in Hong Kong, and if you are not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate logistics, I absolutely recommend purchasing it.
But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same as it was a few years ago when I swore that I would never use it again. You can never find out the actual logistics status. The information will always be delivered in a few weeks, and you can never complain. That’s how bureaucratic it is!
The goods have been received for several days, and the logistics information is that you will receive the goods 10 days later!
Logistics is not selfish
It came like this, not only was the packaging crushed, but the electronics packaging was open, and I don’t know if it was tampered with.
FYI
I haven't tried it yet, but I always trust Philips, and I hope the battery life is longer than other brands.
I looked it up online, and it seems to be a common problem with water ingress, and it is not covered by the warranty.
Damn it!
Wrap it in plastic wrap and continue to use it. I don't know how long it will last.
Bought from someone who had taken it apart
The tax of more than 100 yuan for a machine costing more than 300 yuan is indeed quite high, and I feel more at ease now that it is more than 600 yuan.
The condition of the adhesive tape when I received it was not right, it looked like it had been opened, so I took a photo first, and sure enough, it opened when I tore it, and when I opened it, the paper board inside was also damaged, I was worried that it was returned by someone else, so I tried it out on my husband first before the anniversary, but the machine didn’t turn on at all, luckily there was no garbage in the blade, or I would have to return it from a long distance!
It is not known whether it is good to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term; as in the previous review, the things sent out when there is a shortage are not reliable!
Experience level is slightly above average
It's pretty much top-of-the-line electric toothbrushes, with lots of different brushing modes, but few people change modes every day.
I used it for half a year without any problems. I brushed it every day and charged it once every 1.5 weeks.
The brush head accessory is also cheap on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use. Except for changing the color, other problems that seem to be compatible are the cause of the overseas version?
Those who want to learn the Great Law.
Very good value for money
I have used it 3-4 times.
1. The packaging is in good condition.
2. It is very simple to use and easy to clean.
3. You can do your own hairdressing and save money.
Overall, a very successful purchase.
Fake Goods
The last time I bought two packs, it turned out that there were two different versions, and the words in the lower left corner of the packaging were green, but one of them was not, and the words were white, and the cat got diarrhea after eating it.
I’m not sure if Amazon’s inventory is fake, or if it was dropped by an employee when it was shipped.
I will buy it again, and if it is still a fake, I will hold you accountable.
It's a crossbar!
The picture on Amazon is a hyphen, but the one you sent me is a horizontal line. Isn't that cheating?
Not bad.
Kitty likes to eat, that's the point.
It really works.
Tight, narrow, ankle cuffs, heel cuffs.
Not recommended.
1.UN is clarks most comfortable series, but this one is too bad.
Addition: Today, I compared the previous UN series shoe insoles (I kept the insoles when I threw away the shoes), and the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it is just fake soft.
2. My back of the foot is not high, and the playing part is about 3 cm forward from the highest part of the back of the foot.
3. I bought three pairs of Clarks overseas, but only one pair fits.
I was so scared that I deleted all the songs in my playlist.
Try rockport again, if it doesn't work, you can only go to ecco's physical store.
Second-rate, poor quality control
First of all, it is worth mentioning that Prime International Shopping Ups is very powerful, and I received the parcel on the 31st after placing the order on the 6th.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the texture is good.
The shoe size is slightly larger, 25 feet long 10.5 wide 7.5W, a little loose when worn, but I usually like to wear slightly loose shoes, and I put in a pair of insoles just right.
Secondly, I really can't praise the shoe designer; one shoe sole has a damaged adhesive, and the other shoe surface has various scratches and pinholes, and the adhesive strip is misaligned at the connection between the shoe surface and the shoe sole, which is blatantly second-rate!
I regret it a little!
You can buy Arthur's for 280 yuan, which is a pretty good deal for this price; of course, there are even lower prices if you look at the comments.
Now let’s talk about the shoes. Pros: the shoes are light, running in them is comfortable, and they fit well and won’t fall apart.
The appearance is high, but the shortcomings are also obvious: I usually wear 40 shoes, and I bought 40.5 this time, and when I put it on, there was about an index finger gap at the front of the shoe, but this does not affect anything.
These shoes are very “narrow”, although there is still a gap in front, but it feels tight.
One more thing, the shoes are probably not breathable, and I feel like my feet are hot.
Plantar fasciitis
First, the shoes are well made and worth the price.
My feet are pretty standard, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, I’ve bought a few pairs of Amazon’s Yamei, and they’ve never been uncomfortable, but these I bought according to the comments, size uk7, after wearing them, I found that they were too long because they were a size too big, but because the insole was too thick, it was still very uncomfortable to wear, and because the hiking shoes were very hard, it was very uncomfortable to wear.
If your feet are not particularly thin, I do not recommend buying this one.
If you insist on buying it, you can solve the problem by changing the insoles, but the original insoles look very high-end, which is a pity.
It was a perfect shopping experience!
Very satisfied, I love it very much, there is no doubt that Amazon Global Sourcing is genuine, the quality is very good, the price is reasonable, it is safe to buy, the after-sales service is thoughtful, the customer service attitude is very friendly and kind, the problem is solved patiently and efficiently, the after-sale worry is perfectly solved, the logistics delivery is very convenient and reliable, the delivery man is very thoughtful for customers, he will remind customers to take the goods from the delivery box in time, thank you Amazon for providing such a comfortable shopping experience for customers.
In short, our whole family loves shopping on Amazon Global shopping!
Absolutely bad review!
It is really ridiculous for this agency and Amazon.
In the future, be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon.
Although it has been a long time, I still have to come and complain.
I bought it at a discount during the winter, for less than 200 yuan, and I haven’t used it at home for a few months.
When it was time to use it in the spring, I found that it couldn't connect to the watch, and the manuals of both devices said that they supported each other. Later, I found out that it was a problem with the heart rate strap, because I couldn't connect it to other devices.
I called Amazon and asked them to contact the agency, and the agency asked me to send the device to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
Almost half a month later, the items were sent back to me in their original packaging, including the original shipping box!
No replies and acknowledgments, and no test reports!
At least tell me if it's good or bad!
When I called to ask, they said it was fine to send it back that way, which was good.
But I still can't connect, and the agency replies: It's not their problem.
I'm unlucky, I don't want to be bothered by you for a 200 yuan item.
There was a serious mismatch between supply and demand.
It's very much a case of supply not meeting demand.
The headband material is good.
Much better than Nike.
It is also breathable.
It's just the hat in front.
Very fine.
Are you trying to be funny?!
It doesn't completely block out the sun.
I didn't return it because the headband worked well.
Wear it on your head and it won't block the sun.
But it is different from other headband styles.
Save it for later.
The quality of the goods is good, Amazon lacks a sense of contract, and the delivery person is good.
I require delivery on Saturdays and Sundays!
Amazon's rules do not allow deliveries on Saturdays or Sundays.
I was so annoyed that I drove 200 kilometers from the countryside to pick it up!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery person was very active and enthusiastic.
Give it a thumbs up!
Commodity, I tried it simply, and it is not bad.
But I haven't bought similar products before, so I can't compare the prices!
Size Logistics
The workmanship is good, but the logistics are too slow. In the past, the shoes were all delivered by DHL. This time, Apex is... I have bought a lot of UA in China, and the prices are not low. I feel that the quality is higher than NIKE and ADIDAS?
They are all the same, so I shopped overseas.
Size: I am 176CM tall, weigh 68KG, my shoulders are 180CM, I bought M, the hem is slightly long, other than that, it fits me just right, I see that there are recommendations for S, are you so slim that you prefer S, or do you prefer a looser fit? I think the hoodie would be better if it were a little looser.
Just the right size
Chest circumference 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, I consulted the customer service before purchasing and was told that I should buy XL. After reading the comments, I decided to buy L, and the size was just right when I received the package. I almost got cheated.
The price of Double 11 is much higher than that of Black 5.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The problem with Z affordable goods is troublesome!
Ordered on the 18th, received the goods on the 25th, the speed from Guangzhou to Beijing for snails!
I bought Z affordable goods, and the description said there were scratches, but when I received the goods, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
The kid didn’t want to return the item, thinking it wasn’t a big deal, but the accessory was a small part, and the kid’s grandpa couldn’t find it in any of the hardware stores nearby!
Finally, Grandpa glued it on!
It seems that I can't buy Z affordable products in the future!
Toy processing quality is not good
Most of the screw holes were not aligned, and it was difficult to screw them in, indicating poor processing quality. It was not clear how long it would last, but since it was a promise made to the child, it could not be returned.
Other reviews said it was easy to install, so is there something wrong with the one I bought?
Pretty average.
Am I just unlucky?
The packaging is old and unusable; the workmanship is poor; there is only one type of music, which is only 8 seconds long and then repeats; the action is just nodding your head and walking forward on your own, with no changes.
Not worth the price.
If you need it urgently, you can't return it.
The toys are of good quality, but I have to complain about the packaging
I received the courier yesterday, which was bought from Amazon and labeled as EMS delivery. It was finally delivered by the courier of Tmall. How many bends did it take? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall still good?
As for the packaging, it is wrapped in several layers of cling film, and there is no packaging plastic bubble paper inside. When you open it, all the parts are placed in an empty box. Fortunately, the quality of the toy is good, and there are no broken parts. However, it is much larger than I imagined, because it is not battery-powered, and it often derails when pushed by hand, and it feels like the gap between the rails is too large, and the design is unreasonable.
Good quality, fun
It's a lot of fun, the component precision is high, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is almost the same as Lego, and the price is very favorable when doing activities.
The process of assembling was fun, and my 5-year-old son came to play with me. It was great.
He was laughing so hard that he will probably continue to buy toys of this brand in the future.
The laptop is new, and the shopping from overseas is good
I watched it for Christmas, and it was 150 yuan more expensive than the one I bought before; however, the current delivery is a bit slow.
The car is pretty good, all of them are new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then, if you connect the spirit orbs, you will receive a fantasy.
It's fun to play, and it's more portable than the PS4.
I've already bought Zelda, so I'll try it again after I've played it.
Producing bad products, selling bad products, and as a result, providing bad service. I bought six watches for my kids, and one of the digital displays was incomplete, and the time on all six watches was inconsistent, ranging from 10 to 15 hours apart.
I contacted the manufacturer and asked if there was a verification time when the watch was put into the warehouse. They replied that “there was”. Since there was, why was there such a big difference in time? It must be that the watch was not accurate. In simple terms, it was a counterfeit product. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to hear it, but it was obvious that there was a problem with the quality (the digital display was not complete). All of these problems were taken out to sell, and they were obviously junk.
I contacted the seller, and the seller said a lot of reasons, and also complained that I shouldn’t have bought their product in the first place, a product like this, a seller like this, and after-sales service like this, who would dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future.
In short, I recommend that you do not buy anything from this seller, and even if you buy it, it will be rubbish.
Amazon Shipping Problems
After receiving the goods and inspection, it was found that:
1. The outer packaging is severely damaged.
2. The instruction booklet has severe wrinkles.
3, the clock does not go, the desk lamp charging is not used, and the time cannot be adjusted.
4, contact Amazon customer service separately, and you can only send it to the United States at your own expense, and the shipping fee will be reimbursed later.
5, the reason for 2 points is that the customer service is also good.
I can only say it's tolerable.
Time is not very accurate, about one second per day, and it has been almost two and a half months since I started using it.
I used to use a piece of Iron City before, and I think it won't be slower than a few seconds in a year or two.
The millennium calendar function is pretty good, but the stopwatch function is a bit useless, and you will accidentally enter the stopwatch mode from time to time.
Solar-powered watch
Advantages: Solar charging, no need to worry about battery replacement, world time, multiple alarms and reminders at the hour.
Disadvantages: Mirror is easy to be scratched and dusty.
Value for money: The domestic price is generally between 220 and 300 yuan, and the overseas price is more than 180 yuan when it arrives (it takes about a week).
Very satisfied with the watch.
It is definitely genuine. I checked it at the specialty store, and the appearance of the watch is beautiful, the workmanship is exquisite, the material is sufficient, and it is also an imported mechanical movement. Therefore, it has a certain weight. It is not comparable to the so-called mechanical watches of three or four hundred. This is genuine.
The timing of the watch is very accurate, and the error is completely within the acceptable range. The packaging of the watch comes with a jewelry appraisal certificate. The 12 on the dial is real diamond, which is perfect for me to wear, and it looks great as a gift.
The Bentley table is really good.
The worst shopping experience ever
On the evening of September 23, my wife dropped her phone, and I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon Malaysia. It was in stock, but it was not self-sold and there was no markup (I was secretly happy), and because it was not self-sold, the delivery was slow, and the system showed that the goods were expected to be delivered no later than September 27.
My wife, who didn’t have a mobile phone, died of misery. Early in the morning at around 6:30 the next day, she asked me to think of a solution. Later, when I went to JD.com, I saw that there were 256G products in stock that could be delivered on the same day, so I immediately ordered another one.
After buying the new one, I immediately thought of cancelling the Amazon order.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to pick up the parcel in the morning, so I called customer service at around 7:00 a.m. to cancel the order, and the customer service representative replied that the order had been canceled and that I should wait for a text message to confirm the cancellation.
Okay, I'll wait patiently, and when I checked my phone at noon, the order was still in the unshipped status, so I immediately contacted customer service to request that the order be canceled as soon as possible, and the customer service representative replied that the operation was OK.
When I checked my phone at 3:00 p.m., the order was still there, so I had no choice but to contact customer service again and clearly inform them that I had called three times, please cancel the order and inform the seller not to ship it!
The customer service contacted the seller at my request and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and that I would have to wait until the seller was familiar with the system before the cancellation of the order could be processed.
However, I was clearly told by the seller that he knew about it and that he would definitely not ship it, so please rest assured.
When I checked the order status on Monday, I found that it had already been shipped, and I was speechless.
Unable to contact the seller directly, I had to call customer service again.
The following processing is simply ridiculous; basically, I say one step, and the customer service representative follows up with one operation.
So far, the order is still in the status of refusal of delivery, and we are preparing to send it again!
Wouldn't Amazon proactively follow up?
The seller's company received the money anyway, so it didn't matter.
In conclusion, I will never prepay money for large items in the future. This is too troublesome.
It looks beautiful.
I've been eyeing this camera for a long time, but I didn't buy it because of some other reasons besides the price. This time, I bought it because it was eligible for free shipping.
After buying it, there were no other problems, but when I tried to connect the software, I couldn't connect it at all. My router is a TP router. After searching online, I found that many people had this problem. I spent more than two hours changing the settings of the router, and finally, I used 360WIFI as a medium to solve the problem. In the meantime, I called Xiaomi customer service, and they didn't have any solutions to this problem. They directly told me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.
Another point worth noting is that I saw users' comments on the Internet saying that the minimum storage card supported by this camera is 8G, and smaller storage capacity cannot be recognized, so please pay attention to this.
It feels good to use, and the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is poor, and the machine has a certain degree of heating, and if it is turned on all the time, it feels that this degree of heating is a bit hard to accept.
In view of the above, there are many shortcomings in this product, and I hope you will be careful when you buy it.
I gave it 3 stars because I bought this with my first love in life, and we dated for almost 3 years before he left me last year.
The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because I bought this with my first love in life, and now I don't know how far I can use it, or maybe I threw it away!
We interacted for 3 years, and she left me last year. Whenever I think of her, I feel heartbroken and want to leave this world. The first woman in my life, who brought me shadows and heartache for a lifetime, and I still haven't been able to get over it.
When I bought this phone, I thought of two things at the time, and we could bear it together, but now it is unbearable, and maybe life is like this; there are some people you never want to meet in your life, and there are some things you never want to know, but what can you do?
Every time I see a Samsung phone, I think of her, and the pain that comes with it; I have never been willing to spend more than 2,000 yuan on a phone, but when I bought it for her, I did not hesitate; no matter how good a person is, if she changes her mind, all the promises and vows in the world will come to nothing.
High-quality products among domestic brands
Huawei is a premium product among Made in China products.
Low-key bosses and enterprises rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business trend of relying on advertising to improve brand awareness!
Enterprises without strength will never be able to do so, and will not dare to do so!
It is precisely because of this that I chose Huawei.
I bought it more than half a year ago, and it has been working well for me. It is very good.
The reason I didn't give it a perfect score is because there was one time when I was using offline navigation with it, and there was a positioning issue. I couldn't figure out why, but other times it worked fine.
What's more, it's easy to input your destination online, and after searching, it will automatically design a route for you. When you leave the Wi-Fi area, its offline navigation function is very useful. You don't need to use your traffic, and it directly communicates with the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation, which is great!
Sony is great.
Sony's low-end machine still has a strong sense of design, and the price is cheap, the screen is big, the battery life is great, and it is very suitable for the elderly to use.
Although a long time has passed, the machine is still in good condition.
However, since my Z2 has been delegated, this phone has also fulfilled its mission.
