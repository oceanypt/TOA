The July issue is traditionally delivered during the Moscow Film Festival, and it is, of course, very sad: to read strips when the soul breaks on Shabrol.
Nevertheless, we will report on the Moscow International Film Festival next time (for the time being, I will only complain that this year the organizers have finally consolidated the inexplicable idea that the happy owners of purchased tickets are much more important for the festival than the accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world is guilty of), and in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and at the “Kinotavr”.
The cover of the July issue is decorated with another nice face - the main character of the film "Predators" produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine try not to miss the story about Christopher Nolan's "Beginning" (the man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman..."), the most - without fools - expected film of the summer.
And also this time we publish the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here you definitely do not need to advertise anything, and hedgehog is clear that the author of "Suspicion" and "Wires" - it's our Tatiana Aleshicheva, Boris Glazerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurei, Nikolay Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Seraphima Skibuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasil Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina London-tsareushnitsa Evelyn Salt, despite the brilliant track record, suspected of spying on behalf of the Russians and decided in what would
Driven into a corner, she will paint herself in the usual black and will go in search of the truth.
Another action film with Angelina Jolie as a fatal fight-babe promises to further strengthen the position of the actress in the action genre.
She will arrange one accident after another, run on the walls a-la "The Matrix" and like children to scatter strong men in the same strict suits.
This is how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, my dear, who blew up and repaired the world with "The Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis to him was the most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman - the most stylish and flawless embodiment of evil.
And at the same time, everything together turned out to be not a boring blockbuster of the American type about the salvation of humanity, but the cutest living carnival.
What Besson did 13 years between "Element..." and "Adele..." do not want to remember.
He, to say the least, did not sit idle, but all this script-production hustle and rare, exhausted directorial performances will be forgotten.
But "Adele..." - hardly.
When you watch this film, it seems that 13 years before us was not our Besson, but some kind of double.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drank wine in a café across the street and composed a story about a charming adventurer.
Torecount the plot (even ingeneral terms), warming up expectations, inthis case ismore erroneous than usual.
Here all the incredible drive is that behind every turn or line you are waiting for surprises.
And all as one pleasant.
Either a girl or a vision
Adele's Extraordinary Adventures
The most sinister adventure film of the decade to hint that "Adele's Extraordinary Adventures" will begin as "Amelie", throw towards the "Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy" and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of comics by Jacques Tardi about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin had only appeared in three films before Adele.
She became famous for her role in The Girl from Monaco, for which she was nominated for a César Award.
The director does not run after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging to evaluate the special effects, decorations or tricks, but enthrals behind him, like an old-fashioned novelist, exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the edge of the world: "Forward, my reader, great things await us!"
At the same time, Besson deals with genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, unceremoniously and amusingly, like a boy who has watched old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating banalities, not denying oneself cynicism and not shy of risk
DIRECTOR Luc Besson
CAST: Louise Bourgoin, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Bel, Gilles Lellouche
Plot: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city has been terrified by an ancient monster brought to life by an old medium.
The fossil creature is pursued by the police, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Natural History Museum and a journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has to deal not so much with the beast itself as with the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
ISSUED 22 JULY
"Adele..." is the case when the parody becomes the peak of the genre itself and is able to radically change it, directing it on a new path.
This was the case with Sergio Leone’s spaghetti westerns, Quentin Tarantino’s gangster thrillers, the aforementioned “Indiana Jones” (which was both praised and ridiculed), and, finally, “The Fifth Element”.
Besson's style in this film consists of verbal trickery, acting clownery and plot equilibrium (circus terms are quite appropriate - the union of two arts here is organic and stronger than ever).
A few words should be said about Adele herself.
It embodies the undeservedly forgotten type of an adventurer, who takes not so much the exploitation of sexuality, as pure courage and bravery.
In the cinema to such girls, as a rule, attach some duty macho or hairy romantic
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to Face with History
There is only a shy and comic sigh, which only swirls under his feet (useful only prove to be his knowledge in zoology).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and, it seemed, completely faded, Luc Besson showed an unexpected creative malice, reminding that the border between the preferences of bored visitors of megamalls and high-browed regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for joyful madmen.
Playing in an adventure film without grief, fear and reproach
THE DEATH ROOM
Hermetic horror with a claim to psychology and political context in 2002 horror debut Jonathan Liebesman was taunted by critics, but liked the public and earned well at the box office, and the main thing - caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
Thus, the young director found himself in a factory forging new horrors in the old ways: Bay set himself the goal to remake all the horror classics and entrusted Liebesman with a prequel to "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
The critics were outraged again, but the audience again liked it - Liebesman worked in the spirit of the "new scary", emphasizing the excessive physiological violence.
In general, on its example, you can see how the whole genre is in convulsions, trying to invent new ways of influencing the saturated audience: the naturalistic blood of the splinters merges with the catchers of the slasher.
The plot resembles the "Saw" franchise, but without liters of blood.
Among the prototypes is the debut film of Vincenzo Natali "The Cube". The film was made by Michael Bay.
So in "Death Room" Liebesman was forced to go another way: stupid slaughter or monotonous run from a maniac, he preferred the smarter option - almost without the famous bloodshed, but with psychological game and mysteries.
The evil doctors here play cat-and-mouse with the subjects.
And three men in a locked room are trying to develop a strategy of survival: to unite as a team or shoot each other?
To play by the rules and obey orders from the outside?
Or try to break your cage at all costs?
Not only are they tested, but also a young ambitious employee of the special services, who is tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who has been involved in wild experiments.
Plot: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and each is given a pile of papers with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white robe enters the room, presents himself as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A game of survival begins, closely watched by government agents behind the glass.
Too thoughtful for a horror film, but not enough for an outright arthouse
She can have a social conversation and throw a fire extinguisher at someone's face, but she can't pass a skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is cautious and unyielding in her sympathies.
She is vulnerable to her father’s courtly way of life and candidly watches him, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven’s The Showgirls, diving into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young lover from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not at all the generational difference or the choice of profession, it is, one way or another, already predetermined, but the unsuccessful attempts of the girl to refute the obvious thought that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
Lazy melodramatic Mger Mkrtchan together with Pavel Bardin shot a comedy with Ivan Urgant "Three and a snowflake".
Daddy of an adult daughter in the genre of comedy convincingly portrayed Depardieu
The small plot loops around the love adventures of the heroes, who all the time discuss psychology, and themselves, apparently by witty director's find, emphasize the language of gaze and gesture.
The secondary plot twists (the girl mutilated in a car crash, whom Alexey wants to marry, the athlete-alkash played by Sergey Gorobchenko), unfortunately, are traced only punctually.
Especially pity the line about the business of buying and selling football players, as well as left behind the scenes.
Plot: Most in the world agent selling football stars worry about the fate of his minor daughter Nastya.
The heartbroken father himself changes his wives like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must necessarily marry a guy "with a rod".
What a disappointment for a businessman, when Nastya in the struggle for independence and in defiance of her father chooses his peer and business partner.
On the other hand, with the potential slogan for the film audience, the author hit the nail on the head: “Don’t look for a problem where there is none.”
Their similarity simply can not help but amaze.
In both films there are squads of tough guys, soldiers of luck, forced to avenge those who set them up, and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
The heroes ride almost the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - and there and there explodes something stuffed with dollar bills, and on the set descends a whirlwind of dollars.
Even the villains, dressed in expensive costumes, are not easy to distinguish from each other (played in both cases by Patricks - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was as Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvan White used to make a film about dance battles, "Brotherhood of Dance."
Chris Evans has recently been asked to play a hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvan White was inspired by a comic series that ran in the 1970s and was re-launched in the 2000s, and Joe Carnahan by a comedy series from the 1980s.
It is just amazing how they, without colluding, brought different material to an absolutely identical crushing denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action movies, evoking in memory a lot of pictures with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out to be in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you have to choose between these two films, then "Losers" look a little nicer and clearly victorious in terms of ROI (after all, the budget is three and a half times less).
At least there's Zoe Saldana, who looks great with a bazooka.
CAST: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
Plot: During an operation in the Bolivian jungles, a group of mothers commandos working for the CIA are betrayed by their own superiors: the helicopter with the children they were trying to save is blown up, and the soldiers themselves are considered dead from that second.
But they're alive, and they're determined to take revenge at all costs on the dull-voiced villain who set it all up.
All this is nice, but, frankly, to spend an hour and a half of your life on a painting of White is worth it, only if you have no options more interesting.
Made of recycled materials, pseudo-edible bomb
A Simple Story of a Romanian Convict Fugitive
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, having only these data, it is possible to vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the painting, and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, the film promises to be acutelysocial.
It will certainly be realistic, and tough.
High probability of participation of non-professional actors.
There will also be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film (yes, poverty does not know nationality, but Romanian poverty, as our festival winners prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, not knowing the year of release, you can easily take what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the countries of the Warsaw Pact, which in the early 80s read a lecture on Bresson
The film received the Grand Prize of the Jury at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The screenplay is based on a play by Andreea Valean, whose work is in particular demand among the Romanian “new wave” directors.
Cinematographer Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All this is also true for Florin Serban's debut work, and - understand us correctly - it is not a reproach, but a recommendation: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development when its representatives' faith in
its work has not yet been shaken.
And this moment must be caught: only thanks to this faith it is possible to endure the one-and-a-half-hour spectacle of the Romanian juvenile colony and to surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pistereanu (whose story, despite the gulf separating the two cultures, can easily be
convert into exploitation a-la 70-ies, with a cowboy who decided to walk from the prison, from where he is about to get out, to the nearest saloon).
STARRING: George Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
Plot: After serving four years in prison, 18-year-old Silviu (Pistereanu) is about to be released, but unexpectedly discovers that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From that moment, the young man &apos; s behaviour becomes inadequate.
An affair with social worker Anna further encourages the boy to desperate acts, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the painting.
What a nonsense!
If you want to watch, watch.
Not a bad debut, giving little hope that Romanian arthouse will grow into a decent genre
A cartoon about the joys of evil and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-author Renault is made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, inter alia, for all the "Ice Ages", "Horton" and "Robots".
"Ugly I" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to watch in ZO, especially if you like when different objects from time to time try to jump out of the screen into the hall), decently written, and, most importantly, there is not a single low-level joke, because of which on "Ice Ages" had to shyly squeeze into the chair and cover the children's ears with their hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the sense of proportion of the authors, but the blatant asexuality of the main character, which in turn is dictated by the unwillingness to touch the subject of paedophilia in any way.
The "adult" part here, in addition to the main conflict of single parenthood, is responsible for a rather harsh black humour (which, we would like to think, we owe to director Koffin).
In general, this is a very nice movie - so much that at some point it turns out to be even too perfect and correct.
You can feel the painstaking work of a cohesive team of marketers who thought out every detail to make the film appeal to all categories of citizens.
Not that we want to see children's cartoon heroes eaten by cannibals or killed by a nuclear explosion.
Plot: Nose villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of space travel over the years transformed into the idea to steal the moon, to carry out the grand plan and eliminate the young competitor is forced to resort to the help of children.
In an advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans - Margo in glasses, Edith in a hat and Agnes, whose killer degree of dexterity is comparable only to the cat from "Shrek".
As it usually happens, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is drawn with Christopher Meledandri - they are both bald, snotty and prone to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Siegel.
In the final, Gru dances Travolta's part
To the abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of the desert rolls a cart, from which come out three pairs of good tits.
That's right.
In themselves, the bearers of this gift are not so important.
The camera is firmly focused on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs immediately communicate good news - the whole film is held in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things in female beauty and casting conducted such that what is happening on the screen is of secondary importance.
And there's a lot of fun going on.
"Brokersha", "killersha" and "strip-dancer" dig in the sand, showered with water (don't ask why), carry some purga and periodically quite fiercely fight.
The creators think that a naughty chick with generous shapes, washed in mud, with a broken nose and shiny white teeth - it's cool.
"Dirty Things" is primarily focused on classic sexploitation tapes.
Rick Jacobson directed the episodes "Zeno the Warrior Queen" and "The Amazing Journeys of Hercules".
A similar film in the Moscow box office is “A Barrel for Jennifer”.
It's even cooler when a perverted hottie turns the balls of a bandit, a fucked-up punk fights in pairs with a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword and lesbian sex are added to this; and the intrigue is unraveled through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, for the film fetishist here is discovered a real Klondike of pleasures.
It is understandable, of course, that Jacobson and his gang, shooting this thrash-parody, had a lot of fun, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it were not for the physical data of the actresses, it would be boring by the middle.
It can be assumed that this game came to us from the night channel for adults (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
CAST: Julia Watt, Erin Cummings, America Olive, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
Plot: Three dangerous beauties bring to the desert the boss of the mafia, which somewhere here hidden diamonds for a solid amount.
Having achieved nothing and shooting the unfortunate bandit, the girls begin to get dirty, fighting with each other and periodically arriving from somewhere freaks, as well as regularly kissing and squeezing.
As the case progresses, it becomes apparent that the three are not who they were at the beginning.
Apparently, in the opinion of the author, it is even more funny.
A product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous tastelessness
Yes, with his latest film, Judgment Day, a decadent Mad Max for the poor, Marshall has taken a serious dip.
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum restores the director's shaken confidence.
The new non-politically correct and gloomy magnum opus is not shy of a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and fierce B-movie aesthetics.
There is in the picture and hooligan courage "Dogs-warriors", and animal cruelty "Descent".
The "Marshall Plan" to cleanse the "peplum" of the accumulated post-gladiator film dirt, in general, worked.
In 2011 his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion will be presented by Kevin McDonald.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham, among others) are tough guys trying to marry their military duty with an irresistible desire to survive.
The murder and the spicy details of the discharge of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and detail.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the opening deal in the German forests from the now-standard "Gladiator" by Sir Ridley Scott, but trying to accuse Marshall of plagiarism for some reason absolutely does not want: he works honestly and without claims.
CAST: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
Plot: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
A remote outpost, where the centurion Quintus Dias (Fassbender) serves, is mercilessly destroyed by the Picts.
The miraculously surviving Dias is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a bunch of other surviving Romans, try to escape from a group of Pictish fighters led by the sadistic Etaine (Kurylenko).
The subtle arthouse artist has so far managed to win back in Hollywood only sharp-character roles of the second plan, but we really want to believe that after "Centurion" the situation will change.
Peploum - - edition corrected and supplemented.
Almost like "Gladiator", only more modest and harsh
Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are two teenage vampires and werewolves who live in the same house in the suburbs of New York City.
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
Large-scale film version of the animated series about a bald boy-wizard, called to bring peace to the four kingdoms.

Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) knows how to steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.

Return of the cult character of the 80s to the big screen.
Look at George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-turned-director Anton Corbijn (“Control”) for a very curious existential exploration of the psychology of an aging assassin, hiding from people in a small Italian town, and lately realizing human nature.
"A visionary artist of Corbin's stature and the magnificent George Clooney are a cinematic alliance made in heaven," boasts the studio press release.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love relationship in Clooney's life - with Italy: the shooting took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin Booth's novel "A Very Hidden Gentleman", Rowen Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the place of the English narrator was taken by the American mentioned in the title, and the main hero from the gun-illegal became a simple killer.
Otherwise, the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack tries to figure out his last case and finally put an end to the lucrative craft, his icy heart melts under the charms of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tecla Ruten), in which Clooney's character instantly falls in love.
"Jack is tempting fate," says the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness approaches him closer and closer, and the mysterious lady who hires him may not be who she claims to be.
Judging by the trailer, Corbin's visual experiments, spiced with Clooney's ashy hair (the film resembles the long clip 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the main role in the film "On the Western Front No Change" Remark
Can I shoot you with my camera?
Johnny Depp this season could be seen in two places at once.
First, in Venice, on the set of the thriller “The Tourist” by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (“The Life of Others”).
There he plays a tourist in love with Angelina Jolie's heroine.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico on the set of "Rum Diary", the film adaptation of the debut novel of the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The project is directed and written by Bruce Robinson ("Whitney and I"), whose last directorial work was the thriller "Jennifer 8" in 1992.
Looking at the work of poster artists of the domestic prison drama, one can not even doubt what inspired them.
But you can not approach the question of implementation of the idea literally!
However, it is good at least that the heroine of the Russian painting, although foreign, is not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
On their account already four joint projects: "Lucky Gilmore", "Big Daddy", "Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding", "Don't mess with Gohan!"
In July, the fifth comedy - "Classmates", the sixth - "Fake Wife" with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
The schedule also includes a seventh film - a romantic comedy "Jack and Jill", where Sandler is to simultaneously play Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, who was remembered by the spectator this year with the magical action film "Pipe", will reboot the X-Men.
In the film "X-Men: First Class" the director first called James McAvoy, giving him the role of the young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the telepathic mutant Emma Frost nicknamed the White Queen, Amber Heard will play the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender is expected to play Magneto.
While the shooting of the new Bond series is postponed, its new director Sam Mendes does not get bored.
His list of works includes the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the film adaptation of Izan McEwan's novel "On the Shore".
The script is adapted by the author.
Carey Mulligan was offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of practical Major George Smiley - the main character of the series of novels by John Le Carré - in the film adaptation of the thriller "Spy, Come Out!"
The first adaptation of the play in 1979 starred Alec Guinness.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror "Let Me In".
Tom Tykwer adapts David Mitchell's best-selling fantasy novel Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, it is not easy (in the novel there are six parallel plot lines), but extremely interesting work.
Offers from him have already been made to Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
The shooting of the international action film by Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune" is taking place in Crimea.
It is dedicated to millionaires who went for their money on a real war in search of adrenaline.
Starring Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Wing Rams, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostysheva and others.
The premiere of the film is scheduled for early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy "Baby Jesus" along with the English pop star Pixie Lott
Megan Fox fired from Transformers 3
According to the film company Ragatoipe, the dismissal “is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler”.
However, the place of the main heroine and the new lover of the hero Shaya LaBaf is likely to take the English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
The girl has no experience in film, so she is facing accelerated courses of acting.
This fact should not scare the sophisticated viewer - in the history of cinema there are many examples of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ('Monster'), Angelina Jolie ('Broken'), Jessica Lange ('Blue Skies', 'Tutsi'), Kim Basinger ('Lost in Translation'), Jennifer Connelly ('Mind Games'), Gina Davis ('Casual Tourist') and 'First Vice Miss USA 1986' Halle Berry ('Ball of Monsters') started out as models or fashion magazine models, and eventually won their well-deserved Oscars.
Succeed in acting (also beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, which is especially pleasant, our compatriot Olga Kurilenko.
High rewards are clearly at their fingertips.
In short, Rosie has an example to follow.
Valeria Gai Germanica, who won the Special Mention of the Cannes Jury in 2008 for the film "Everyone will die, but I will stay" and directed the controversial TV series "School", received the post of creative director at MT TV.
The management of the channel believes that Valeria will be able to bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, the shooting of its own series (about teenagers or vampires) is already planned.
Germanika also started casting new presenters.
The comedy “Kolotilov” directed by Leo Gabriadze and produced by Timur Bekmambetov suddenly turned into “Vykrutasy”.
The main theme of the film remained the same - the provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) hastens to Moscow to the bride, but is delayed to train a football team of street children.
The second storyline of the painting received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaxina, Milla Iovovich will play the role of the bride Nadia.
As an additional intrigue will appear a third - Nadia's ex-boyfriend Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the courtyard team will win the football championship, there is the dilemma of who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant postponements of the filming of "The Hobbit" and the presence of a mass of side projects, Guillermo del Toro abandoned the position of the director.
The studios persuaded producer Peter Jackson to take matters into his own hands, but he was only willing to do so if it was absolutely necessary.
David Yates, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose District 9, produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination, have been mentioned as possible successors.
Officially, the name of the new director will be named at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie to Play Cleopatra
Bewildered by the tight schedule, critics and cinematographers raced between Sochi’s Winter Theatre, where screenings with master classes took place, and the “Pearl” hotel, where press conferences and round tables took place, barely having time to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films were also up to the task - in practically every film someone ran somewhere: perplexed Asians from Yusup Razykov's "Gastarbeiter" and Dmitry Mamuli's "Another Sky" were looking for their missing grandson and wife, a runaway bandit from Yuri Bykov's "To Live"
The same cops were happily led around the finger by the hero of the detective Klim Shipenko "Who am I?" - which, however, was remembered by the public rather by the presence in the frame of the totally naked Jeanne Friske.
Heroes of domestic show-business appeared in a couple of other competition films - in the film "Elephant" Sergey Shnurov played a truck driver carrying a circus animal to the slaughter, and Yevgeny Grishkovets reflected on favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film production for two "Satisfaction", where business partners challenged each other to an alcohol duel because of a lady.
However, business events at Kinotavr also bore a tangible imprint of the show - it was not boring at any of them.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of Russian arthouse, the chairman of the support fund for domestic cinema, Sergey Tolstikov, had a picturesque quarrel with critics: “Do you read the articles in the press that I read?” he asked the gathered grimly.
"I write them," — confusedly answered the president of ERVEZS! Andrei Plakhov.
Scandals did not end there: closer to the end of the festival, Alexey Fedorchenko's film "Oatmeal" was suddenly removed from the competition program - it will go to Venice: Mostra's selectors decided that an unnecessary Russian show was an obstacle to them.
In the past, "Kinotavr" did not interfere with the giants - in Sochi films of large festivals were shown many times: this time, for example, Sergey Loznitsa's film "My Happiness" participated in the competition, competing in the spring with Mikhalkov and Virasetakun for the Blue Beret.
Nikita Sergeyevich visited the film of the former Cannes competitor at the Kinotavr and said that he liked it.
Chairman of the jury Karen Shahnazarov, on the contrary, did not like Loznitsa's film at all - but under pressure from colleagues he was forced to give her the prize for directing.
The award for the best debut - "The Missing" - received the daughter
A horrible film encyclopedia of Russian life: a naive, humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked to monstrous acts without any apparent purpose.
A precisely directed, purifying film-experience, directed by a misanthrope with a mathematical education, which calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls his films quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script and claims that the joy of the viewer is in the effort to understand his meditative films.
The most complex film of Kinotavr has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition – the director’s star is born.
The impeccably dressed and groomed programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disdain, hiding in the den of neat bachelor life.
But a cast-iron goddess descends on the house, the unjust hand of the punitive authorities falls on the hero’s head, and he begins a meaningless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it is useful to work not only with debutants," declared the producer Sabina Eremeeva from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabina simply managed to pull the "internal debutant" from the master of domestic art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - nowadays, in our cinema, the bisons are moving behind the youth.
Not the other way around.
Documentary film, shot in such a way that the head is worn cleaner than from similar art.
The author is interested in the screwdriver, exploring the electric meter, and a piece of unsalted cream, drifting on a cast iron pan, - all this turns the story about an unemployed miner, his rare-toothed lover and her criminal-brother into a real dock-canvas with oil.
Nikolai Sokolov, winner of the short film competition, applies the black-and-white style of the French New Wave to the world of residential neighborhoods.
Let Gogarty's montage moves in the story about two schoolchildren, one of whom dreams of making a bomb, and the other - to play Bach backwards, look strange, but for a rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality - thank you.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircraft type An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means of impact on clouds and loaded with special environmentally clean chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granular carbonic acid ("dry ice"), meteorological pyrocartridges with iodized silver and powdery reagents.
The process is as follows: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and strength of the rain front) “break” the clouds coming to the city with these reagents.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned, and exactly where the cloud was impacted.”
For ten years there has been work on a remake of a science fiction film starring Michael York.
Recently, Karl Rinsch was appointed as the director (he already has a remake of "Creatures of the Black Lagoon" on his schedule), famous for his commercials.
Brian Singer (X-Men), James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) have previously been linked to the project.
According to the plot, the hero, who turned thirty, is forced to escape the death penalty, because the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to a 1980s rotoscoping fantasy cartoon and plans to make a large-scale film from it.
The original was a collaboration between director Ralph Bakshi (The Lord of the Rings, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a large number of drawn tits.
In it, warrior Larn saves princess Tiger and all the people from the evil ice lord Necron.
Rodriguez promises to be careful about creating nonhumans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will be sending his zombies on vacation soon, as 1 himself plans to remake Dario Argento's classic giallo.
The heroes will be brought back to the big screen by none other than Michael Bay - the master of action, explosions and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Damien Chen, who will adapt the script.
Argento and Romero had previously collaborated on Day of the Dead and directed Two Evil Eyes together in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio produces the film and writes the screenplay.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte to Join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in Remake of Comedy "Arthur"
“I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the state of affairs in China,” says Chen.
- Chinese women nowadays run big businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gong Li embodies that power."
You're playing an imaginary character for the second time in a row.
Is that a coincidence?
Regularity.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I am presenting two films here (at Kinotavr and the Sochi Film Market - EMRB).
And in both I play a dream woman.
But... this is how the director saw me, this is how he presented me, and many people probably think that this is how I am in life.
A dream girl.
Your partner in the film, Alexander Yatsenko, does not resemble his hero at all.
How did you find a common language? What is it on the pitch?
It is absolutely not what it seems at first glance.
At first I saw it and thought, "Yeah... I don't just have to."
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, we would have nothing.
And this contact happened to us literally a few minutes after we met.
We made great friends, I'm not afraid to say it.
I told him about all my fears, about all my experiences, about the fact that I was afraid that I would not succeed, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me this advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid to lose this contact, to lose our mutual understanding.
And so at the premiere we watched the whole movie holding hands.
How was the shooting in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city I came to for the first time.
I have never been on tour there, neither on vacation, nor in my childhood I came there.
This city has a special magic, some of its character, its charisma.
And it is a city to which you want to return.
It has its provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry anywhere and always manages everywhere.
So it wasn't hard for you to play in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on the screen, which many, frankly speaking, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you?
You know, I'm an amateur actor.
And I'm a very trusting person by nature.
If I came and agreed to work with a director, then I actually trust in his hands and I want to be the dough from which they will sculpt.
I perfectly understand that from the outside is better, and I, again, ask for hints and talk to the director, very long, not even I talk to him, but he leads preliminary conversations with me and extremely clearly and precisely explains what he needs.
And then, through long, many-hour rehearsals, we come to the organics you are talking about.
And how did you work with director Klim Shipenko?
I enjoyed everyone, the cameraman, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I love working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep, not to eat - and here was exactly that situation.
Not sleeping, not eating for 24 hours - and still, even thunder, even hail.
And if something did not work - it was a catastrophe, and you need to urgently do something to make it work.
It is very easy to work in this atmosphere of madness.
And it seems to me that when people are so moved to a pathological fanaticism on what they are doing, it cannot fail, because too much energy is expended.
Which scenarios are you rejecting?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don’t want nonsense, stupid dialogues, movies that don’t say anything, don’t carry anything.
I don't want to work just to appear on the screen.
Do you have any proposals, projects on which you are going to work in the near future?
There are currently no specific proposals or plans.
I'm not the type to draw up schedules.
The script came, it interested me, today happened this premiere.

BOX OF TRANSPARENCY
While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are going on almost continuously in Moscow: American film - "Amfest", "2toggo", "2-t-1" will start in a few days, followed by the British film festival.
And here's what's interesting: half of my acquaintances are constantly discussing that someone should be boycotted, and someone should be supported, for some - well, excuse me - very vague reasons.
However, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed by a terrifying Chu4 projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
The least you want to grumble about it, but if you, buying a ticket for money, stay in the hall to look at the giant pixels and horizontal figures of actors, then you will be shown them.
Meanwhile, we have no pixels in the issue: "Tron: Legacy" (a sequel to the classic film about virtual reality), "Let Me In. Saga" (an American remake of a beautiful Swedish film), "Uncontrollable" (another approach by Tony Scott to the theme of trains) and a crazy detailed account of how the films about Conan, the Barbarian, the Destroyer and the Governor were made.

SOCIAL NETWORK
History of Facebook
David Fincher's new film is first and foremost a story of paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the whole world, divided five friends and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the lead role is as brilliant as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg is launching the site for a variety of reasons: partly because of anger at the world around him, partly because of a sporting interest, and partly simply because IT’S “cool.”
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of "The Social Network" become apparent from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg is talking in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara) less than five minutes: the loud, tough dialogue of the writer Aaron Sorkin gain strength already here and do not soften until the very end.
The same with the direction of Fincher: relatively restrained (except for the Twins Winkelhocks played actors unlike each other.
The face of one of them was superimposed on the other by means of computer graphics.
Natalie Portman studied at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Rooney Mara was cast in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
DIRECTOR David Fincher
CAST: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Hermione Hammer, Joshua Pence
Plot: The gloomy and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, getting a turn on the personal front from the gate, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As the popularity of Facebook grows, relationships with the few companion friends begin to deteriorate, eventually leading to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its role: warm, sometimes sunny, even in the darkness remaining cozy, it manoeuvres between two entangled chains of events and two separate lawsuits.
Beyond a stream of endless discussions, not much happens in the film: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg’s lawsuits are unlikely to add even an extra paragraph to his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher in this not too generous with details story?
After viewing, there is a persistent feeling that "The Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case - an important artistic technique.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing about the same thing, but on a larger scale, with cosmic egos and big deals.
Now that day-to-day solvency is even higher, policy is no longer made in boardrooms and sandpits.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is upset that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevoss brothers (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are trampling on their feet: who said rich, handsome, and athletic couldn’t also be smart?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, “The Social Network” could easily turn into a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with popularity and leadership, but what else is there – positive or negative?
And what social consequences will his invention entail?
Is he a scammer?
Or a clever manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin would never close a book with the slightest hint of this.
But it will not even be necessary here: in their version of history, it does not matter at all.
“What is it like to feel beautiful?” asks Tre VeaNez’s song “VaBu Woc’te A Vsp Map”, which opens the credits.
The hero does not know.
The film suggests an answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of the lost online generation, which has a poor idea of beauty and even less of feelings.
A tastefully crafted character drama about a high-profile lawsuit of the Internet era
At the beginning of the 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames of people of unknown origin had not yet begun to appear.
They were referred to as "so-and-so, such-and-such son".
That is, there were patronyms - nicknames after the father.
But sometimes, for example, in the case of the father &apos; s remarriage, a matronym, a nickname after the mother &apos; s name, was used.
Susanin is just such a case: "Ivan, the son of Susanna".
Peasants of small landowners indeed for a long time did without surnames - why it, when you have 20 souls and all constantly in sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Thus, the serfs of Prince Andrew of Cherkasy already at the beginning of the 18th century all had surnames.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep the man on the land, but let him go on a meal - let him earn a craft and pay the master.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where the surname was to be entered.
To the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia 55% of serfs were released for a meal.
So they already had surnames.
Capital criminalists arrived to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Criminalists of the central apparatus and employees of the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the case of the gas explosion in the house on Linenaya, 39, reports NGS.
According to the investigation, the defendants, Irina Urbach and Evgeny Kavun, representing employees of the fictitious organization "Mezhregiongaz", examined and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality parts, worked carelessly, and prices for their services, on the contrary, inflated, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Linenaya, a man and a woman visited three apartments in house No. 39, where they changed the hoses of the stoves.
For example, in one of the apartments they installed a water hose instead of a gas one.
Kavun, however, denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a gas-air mixture leaked and exploded in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the second partially.
This caused a significant collapse of the building, resulting in the deaths of 13 people.
Earlier arrested suspects in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk.
The scammers came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg managed to avoid a sea flood
Arguments of the Week.

Prevent the flood specialists were able thanks to the closure of the dam the day before.
On Friday in St. Petersburg sharply increased the threat of floods due to bad weather in the city.
The storm surge was prevented by closing the dam in a timely manner.
The potential flood could become the 32nd in a row, reports the St. Petersburg publication Neva.Today.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the locks in the Gulf of Finland, the water level remained at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of dangerous flooding (between 161 and 210 centimeters).
The weather conditions were complicated by gusts of wind, whose speed sometimes reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been opened again, the water level has dropped, and ships can again sail the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that the situation with the water level is monitored by ten weather stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This prevents the flooding that can follow a strong wind.
In Turkey, 8 people arrested in the case of defects in collapsed buildings
In the Turkish province of Sanliurfa, eight people were arrested in connection with construction defects found in buildings collapsed as a result of the earthquake.
According to Armenianpress, this is reported by Habertürk.
As a result of the earthquake registered in Turkey on February 6, more than 20 thousand people died.
The number of wounded exceeds 80,000.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7 magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of aftershocks, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader and the President of Iran

WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, on Friday an airplane bomb from the Second World War exploded, which engineers were trying to disarm.
A powerful explosion was heard for tens of kilometers, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police announced that although the explosion was unplanned, no military personnel involved in defusing the bomb were injured.
"The device detonated shortly after decontamination began.
Fortunately, all the personnel are safe.
Agencies have begun to assess the damage," - told reporters assistant chief of police of Norfolk Nick Davison.
Local residents write in social networks that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

Caption: The explosion occurred contrary to the plans of the sappers, but there were no deaths or injuries
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the Yar River, at the mouth of which, on the shore of the North Sea, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the engineers built a protective sand wall around it, and a fence was erected 200 metres away to prevent outsiders from entering.
Initially, on Thursday, the detonators were going to cut the detonator from the bomb with the help of a robot, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, as the local press writes, to use the technique of "slow combustion" of explosives.
The explosion occurred in the process of burning.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
In the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from autumn 1940 to spring 1941 alone, known as the Blitz, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Women account for almost 40 per cent of Belarusian researchers
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, research associate of the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences Alesia Solovey told BELA.
The proportion of women among candidates and doctors of science is also increasing: 41.1 per cent of candidates and 21 per cent of doctors are women.
In all fields of science, except technical, the proportion of women has exceeded 50 per cent.
The most feminized field of scientific knowledge is the medical sciences, where women account for 64.4 per cent.
Only the technical sciences are dominated by men, with women accounting for 26.7 per cent.
In the National Academy of Sciences, women account for 49.1 per cent of researchers, which is 10.2 per cent more than the national average.
Women account for 46 per cent of candidates and 20 per cent of doctors.
More than half (57 per cent) of the teaching staff in higher education institutions are women.
Among vice-rectors for scientific, teaching and educational work, every third is a woman (31.8 per cent), among deans - 38.7 per cent, deputy deans - 44.6 per cent, heads of departments - 42.5 per cent.
Women account for more than 60 per cent of senior lecturers and lecturers.
The proportion of women associate professors in departments is also high (55.2 per cent).
According to the national monitoring of public opinion, conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, most Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagreed to some extent with the gender stereotype that science is a male sphere of activity.
More than half of the country &apos; s inhabitants do not believe that women are less competent as scientists - 66.1 per cent (59 per cent of men and 71.6 per cent of women).
"The transformation in the mass consciousness of gender perceptions of women's research competence contributes to the involvement of young women in science, the development of their creative potential, the formation of a successful role model of a female scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring," Alessia Solovey noted.
The International Day of Women and Girls in Science is observed annually on 11 February.
The aim of the festival is to attract women and girls to science, to encourage women to pursue scientific careers and to recognize women &apos; s achievements in science.
According to UNESCO, women account for 30% of the world's researchers.-0-
The probability of a future increase in the key rate is higher than its decrease
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina after the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep the rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have occurred recently.
On the one hand, the terms of foreign trade have deteriorated noticeably - the prices of Russian oil have fallen.
On the other hand, the economic situation is better than the October forecast.
The shift in demand continues: consumption remains subdued, private investment is slowing, but fiscal spending is rising.
At the same time, pro-inflationary risks have generally increased.
"Therefore, the likelihood of raising the rate this year exceeds the likelihood of lowering it.
The advisability of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," Nabiullina said.
Besides the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
First, rapidly boosting consumption in an environment of elevated inflation expectations, should the factors that are holding back consumer activity weaken.
Second, there is a growing shortage of labour and productivity growth is lagging behind wage growth.
And there are still risks of further tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the strengthening of pro-inflationary factors noted earlier, the inflation forecast for this year remains at the level of 5 - 7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than expected in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate are raised by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% p.a. for 2023 and 6.5-7.5% p.a. for 2024.
"This does not rule out a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scope have diminished.
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that it may be necessary to raise the rate somewhat so that in 2024 inflation corresponds to the target of close to 4%", - concluded the head of the Bank of Russia.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for the creation of special closed mutual investment funds (CIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be removed from the composition of existing retail SIPs.
This will enable the management of the remaining liquid assets and the resumption of operations with investment units.
If there are more than 10% of blocked securities in a retail PIF, the management company must allocate them to a separate closed PIF by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in a quantity equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of the retail fund to closed.
For funds with less than 10% of locked-in securities, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company is entitled to allocate the blocked assets to a separate closed PIF.
In addition, there is a requirement to inform shareholders of the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities into a special SIP.
In the future, in the event of the sale of such securities, management companies are required to pay quarterly to the owners of investment shares at least 90% of the proceeds, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
In addition to summarizing the industry, experts gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center of Analysis and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022, passenger traffic of air transport in Russia decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transport - by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger transportation amounted to 95.2 million people, and passenger turnover - 228.0 billion passenger-kilometres.
International passenger transportation amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% below the level of the previous year, domestic transportation - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry has been influenced by state support programs.
In 2022, there was a program to stimulate domestic tourism, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could get a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rosturizm.
Several state support programs were also implemented to ensure accessibility of air transportation, including subsidizing the transportation of citizens, the development of regional transportation, etc. with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and to recapitalize Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international routes, as well as the continuation of subsidizing the industry by the state (so far allocated 25.3 billion rubles) in 2023, passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4% to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will amount to 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviatsiya, to 103.0 million people," - share the forecasts of PSB analysts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, killed a 6-year-old child
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were killed in a car crash at a bus stop in Jerusalem.
Six others were injured.
The car driver was shot dead on the spot.
It was later revealed that he was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
His actions were classified as a terrorist attack by law enforcement agencies, the terrorist's relatives were detained and the house sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental health problems, only this week he was discharged from the hospital.
Austria is once again tightening controls on the border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say that many people remain at the border in their cars, waiting to cross to the Austrian side.
It thus signals to the Austrian authorities that they have already gone through the asylum procedure in Hungary.
On the basis of existing arrangements, Austria considers that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was made.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities did not consider it appropriate to automatically send back to Hungary those wishing to cross the border: many migrants became victims of smugglers and found themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, in the opinion of the police, more controls are needed.
The decision to tighten controls by Vienna followed a promise by European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to protect the commonwealth’s borders.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants arriving in the EU and requesting refugee status exceeded the figures of 2016 for the first time and amounted to more than 330 thousand.
Progress 83 successfully docked with ISS
The unmanned resupply spacecraft Progress 83 successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3.45 GMT, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking took place at an altitude of 269 statute miles over the South Pacific Ocean.
The docking was broadcast from the NASA Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was monitored by specialists from the Mission Control Centre.
From the ISS, the cargo ship was welcomed by cosmonauts Sergey Prokofiev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina.
Progress MS-22 delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from Russia's Baikonur cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos announced the dehermetization of Progress MS-21, prepared for docking from the ISS and further submersion on February 18.
As specified in the press service of the company, the transition hatch of the ship was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" is isolated from the overall volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its dehermetization are being investigated."

How Pregnant Russians Got Stuck in Argentina
The Migration Service of Argentina began to suspend and cancel the validity of the residence permit of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not stay in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic denied entry into the country to several pregnant Russians, who were suspected of arriving for the purposes of "maternity tourism".
On 11 February, they were allowed to enter Argentina by court order.
More information - in the article "Gazeta.ru".
The Migration Service of Argentina began to suspend and cancel the validity of the residence permit (VNP) of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not stay in the country.
The director of the service, Florence Carignano, told C5N.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to obtain a residence permit because their child is Argentine, but who have spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)", she explained.
According to her, when the court will consider the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian, the immigration service will submit data that the VNR was suspended because the person "spent a month in Argentina and never came back."
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left, it may be withdrawn.
Against this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at the airport in Argentina because of refusal to enter the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, Georgiy Polin, the diplomatic mission associates what happened with the fact that the authorities of the republic could consider the information provided by the girls on entry, incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, the other two - in the evening of February 8, reports RIA Novosti.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women arrived in Argentina, but specifically these three were ordered not to enter the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the law on migration, where one of the grounds for non-admission into the country is the provision of incomplete, false, distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the immigration service of Argentina by a court decision allowed into the country pregnant Russian citizens, said lawyer Christian Rubilar.
"An hour ago they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quoted him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the Migration Service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport.
It allows for short-term travel to 171 countries without visas, including EU countries, the United Kingdom and Japan, RBC notes.
In early January 2023, The Guardian newspaper wrote about the "boom of maternity tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, in 2022, from 2,000 to 2,500 Russian citizens moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who are going to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number may rise to 10 thousand," he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that in 2022 about 10,500 Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in recent months - more than 5,800 pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how the prices for renting housing in St. Petersburg changed.
It has decreased by 10%.
At the same time, it is known that throughout the country rent has become more expensive by 25%, reports Patrol Petersburg with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-bedroom apartment cost 25,000 rubles a month, a studio - 22,000 rubles a month, a two-bedroom - 36,000 rubles a month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country became known.
The Migration Service of Argentina did not let into the country six pregnant Russian women, as the purpose of the visit, which was indicated by them, turned out to be false.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the television Todo Noticias.
For five hours, the pregnant women were questioned about the purpose of the visit.
Most of them confessed that they had come to a foreign country to give birth.
In this connection, the representatives of the country did not let the Russian women into Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure if there are suspicions of "fake" travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is at the 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she can not clearly tell about where to go to rest, then she immediately falls under suspicion on the part of the migration service.
Moreover, specialists specify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions".

Kirkorov won the fisherman's court
In the suit, the man claimed the illegality of the artist's building, but did not appear at the hearing.
Rybak sued the musician Filipp Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier at his suburban dacha.
About it writes "Fifth Channel".
Nevertheless, the Saratov fisherman failed to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, the court was presented with documents, design projects, which confirmed the legality of all the structures installed on the territory of the celebrity’s house.
As stated by the head of the law firm Alexander Dobrovinskoy, the construction of the pier left the plaintiff no chance to go fishing.

Somnologist named the causes of sleep problems
Doctor-somnologist Sofia Cherkasova told about foods and habits, Which interfere with healthy sleep.
As noted by the specialist, problems with sleep often arise due to products containing caffeine.
It is primarily about tea, coffee, chocolate and any cocoa-containing desserts.
Their consumption before bedtime should be limited, because they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "broken", which means not allowing the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, the use of caffeinated products is better to stop 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to lowering the excitability threshold of the nervous system and, as a result, difficulties with falling asleep.
Negatively affects the ability to sleep and alcohol.
The doctor specifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as superficial sleep and frequent night awakenings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep somnologist recommends to give up sharp food in large portions.
Large volumes and spicy food contribute to an increase in the internal temperature of the body, which negatively affects the ability to plunge into sleep.
For healthy sleep, it is necessary not only to observe the external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
In the opinion of Cherkasova, it is not worth abusing heavy food before bed, because it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also recalled that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and usual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to the sleep and rest regime and allow the body to recover.

The situation is somewhat similar to what happened with our ship (Soyuz MS-22 - TASS) in mid-December," he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with the "Soyuz" came to the conclusion that the leak was caused by a micrometeorite.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure that there are no problems with subsequent launches.
"We need to conduct a thorough analysis to make sure that this reason does not extend to similar designs on future launches.
This is the most important task that will now stand before us," he said.

Deputy Director of RZD proposed to the Governor of Irkutsk region to explore new sales directions
The Irkutsk region needs to continue exploring alternative sales directions, except for the Far East.
This is the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by Deputy General Director of RZD Alexey Shilo at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reported on February 10, 2023.
- As last year's practice has shown, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this solution can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of companies constantly interact with our "neighbors" (ports, operators, maritime transport) and find optimal price conditions for the transportation of their products under new schemes, - emphasized Alexey Shilo.
The Governor noted the importance of the stability of shipment of products, Irkutsk region is one of the richest mineral resources regions of the Russian Federation and has significant reserves of hard and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of export shipments has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Also, Igor Kobzev emphasized that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and products of the metallurgical industry produced in the region to a level ensuring stable work of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to provide support in terms of transport volumes.
If there are additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market, then in this direction we are also ready to provide assistance, - said Alexey Shilo.

Therefore, sellers sometimes connect houses to nearby networks, which is already a reason for switching off the power supply.
Therefore, network companies in those territories where active construction is taking place should pay special attention to this issue, - emphasized Konstantin Zaitsev.

Crossing on the Armenian-Turkish border opened for the first time in decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid
For the first time in three decades, the Margara-Alijan border crossing on the Turkish-Armenian border was opened for the delivery of humanitarian aid to the earthquake victims.
This is reported by Turkish and Armenian media.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating 1988 earthquake, the Turkish news agency Anadolu reported.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water and other emergency aid packages to the town of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, Ankara's special representative to the Armenian-Turkish talks Serdar Kılıç said.
He expressed his gratitude to the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of Armenia, Ruben Rubinyan, and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia, Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the assistance sent by the people of Armenia to ease the suffering of our people in the earthquake-stricken region," Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia, Vahan Unanyan, in turn, reported that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border through the Margaha bridge and are heading to the earthquake-affected region.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed Margarita Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish news agency "Anadolu" cites different data and writes that the Margaha-Alijan border crossing was last used to deliver humanitarian goods to Armenia to eliminate the consequences of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
At that time, aid collected by the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to the earthquake-affected areas.
According to the latest figures, more than 25,000 people died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
On 11 February, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that 21,848 people had died in Turkey.
On the Syrian side, 3,553 deaths were reported.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are mainly marred by Ankara’s refusal to acknowledge the genocide of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, and its support for Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives, who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization.
In February 2022, commercial air traffic between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border for third-country nationals as soon as possible.

He made a big mistake and for most people will remain in the memory of people not as a footballer, but as a footballer-offender.

A tanker with diesel from a previously Russian-flagged vessel was not allowed into the port of Spain
The Maritime Command of Tarragona of the General Directorate of the Merchant Navy under the Ministry of Transport of Spain has prohibited the entry into the port of the city of the Maersk Magellan ship for the unloading of diesel fuel, because the cargo comes from the Nobel ship, which until July 1, 2022 went under the Russian flag, the Spanish Ministry of Transport said.
"The Maritime Command of Tarragona of the General Directorate of the Merchant Fleet under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has prohibited the entry into the port of Tarragona for the unloading of diesel fuel on the vessel "Maersk Magellan" under the flag of Singapore, because the cargo it carries comes from the vessel under the Cameroonian flag "Nobel", which until July 1, 2022 was under the Russian flag," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was taken in accordance with EU legislation, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag from April 16, 2022, or changing its flag after February 24, 2022.
The Ministry specified that the inspection was carried out on February 9, after which the ban was agreed.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships are prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the Black Star, a Maltese-flagged vessel carrying cargo from a Russian-flagged vessel, was denied access to the port of Barcelona.

Problems arising in pregnant Russian women with entry to Argentina explained
According to the specialist, against the backdrop of the influx of those wishing to have a child in Argentina, the country's authorities have become more carefully monitoring the entry of foreign nationals into its territory.
Difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women to Argentina are related to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in the mass influx of foreigners wishing to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
This is reported by "Lenta.ru" with reference to professor of St. Petersburg State University Viktor Heifets, editor-in-chief of the magazine "Latin America".
He said that no country supported such practices.
He noted that Argentina was opposed to becoming a transit point rather than a destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practices.
The expert explained that the child would retain Argentine nationality, but it would be up to the court to decide whether to grant the parents an Argentine passport once they had obtained a residence permit.
If it was found that they had not actually lived in Argentina and had left immediately, they could be denied citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as indicated by the specialist, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship by "jus soli", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
Argentine passport opens the possibility for visa-free visits to 170 countries, including EU countries and the United Kingdom.
It was previously reported that Argentina began to revoke the VWP of Russians who received the document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is committed to reducing such incidents.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina in connection with the suspicion of providing false data on the motives of the trip.
Hundreds of new fitness clubs are expected to open in Russia
In Russia, the interest of citizens in fitness services is being restored, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year in the country may open more than 400 new facilities, mostly small format.
In Russia may open about 400 new fitness clubs, their total number may increase by 5 percent.
As reported by Kommersant, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8,600 clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-scale projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
Such data are provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
President of the Association of Operators of the fitness industry Olga Kiseleva in conversation with the publication noted that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NFS President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, every year there were more club closures than openings.
Their number has decreased by 37 per cent over the past three years.
However, independent analysts give different figures.
According to Kontur.Fokus, over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main type of activity "work of the fitness center" has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5,120.
The industry suffered great losses due to the pandemic, but already in 2021 it began to recover.
According to 2GIS, there are 4.5 thousand fitness clubs in Russian millionaire cities.
Russians began to pay more attention to physical activity, which is reflected in the increase in attendance of fitness clubs.
As of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year-on-year.
As Silina noted, if the trend is maintained, then by the end of the year the industry will return to pre-crisis indicators.
The license of the management company from Kirov was withdrawn
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov region cancelled the license for the management of multi-apartment buildings, issued to the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, the regional Arbitration Court cancelled the license for the management of multi-apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Zabota".
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was adopted in November 2022, but came into force only in February 2023.
The Arbitration Tribunal deprived the "manager" of the license because the organization has repeatedly ignored the instructions of the State Housing Inspectorate.
At present, all the objects that were under the management of "Zabota" have been removed from the register of licenses for the performance of business activities for the management of multi-apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The fact that they remained without a management company, the administration of Kirov know.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor of the situation.
Recall that in January 2023, the Governor of the Kirov region Alexander Sokolov set the task before the employees of the State Housing Inspection to liquidate 2/3 of the region's management companies by spring, because there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands caused doubts among the Kirov Communists.
They contacted the regional prosecutor’s office and requested that Sokolov be held administratively liable.
Presumably, the same position could be taken in the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The anti-monopoly authorities allegedly also asked the prosecutor’s office to verify the legality of the region’s leader’s actions.

As it follows from it, the company is entitled to debit money from the removed cards without notifying the customer, if payment with others does not pass for one reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, said that payments with buyers are made with the permission of customers, and no leakage of bank card data can occur.

Beautiful place especially in summer, around the mammoth sculpture gazebo with mangals.
The territory is not a large park where you can walk with your family.
Large parking lot.
The store is located on the ground floor of the Universal City Mall.
Hours of operation from 10-00 to 22-00.
In the shop you can drink coffee and snack with fresh baked goods.
There is a small parking lot from the mall.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, a large selection of syrups and alternative milk.
Delicious fresh baked goods😍😍😍.
Cheesy sandwiches.
Convenient cafeteria area
They came with their daughter to apply for a pension.
They welcomed me, explained everything clearly, scanned the documents, filed the application, told me how to sign up for subsequent receptions.
At the entrance, the administrator and security meet culturally, respectfully.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, although a cooler with water would not hurt to buy more.
Came 2 times, everything is great!
I wish all employees peace, good luck and a decent salary in this difficult time for all!!!
Just a great place!
After a long walk on the beach there is nothing better than sitting at the window with a glass of mulled wine in anticipation of a salad with scallops (which tastes just amazing!!!)
Highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
The nice cashier asked me with her or in the hall to make me coffee, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked in the hall, 300 ml.
A few minutes later, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted in ceramics, so "in the hall".
I got hurt.
I ask why in a glass and not in a cup.
The girl answers that they do not have cups with a volume of 300 ml.
That's how it fits in a person's head?
Ask with you or in the hall, that is, for yourself to determine the technology: pour coffee in a cup or in a disposable cup.
Get the answer - in the hall, that is, in the cup.
Please specify volume.
Hear that 300 ml.
To put a person in front of the fact that there are no cups of such volume.
Here, say, a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is remarkable that this is the third such case in Zelenaya Okolitsa in my memory.
It is doubly remarkable that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of a plastic cup into it and drink coffee the way I want. I asked for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Are the Green Neighborhood Cafeteria and the Green Neighborhood two sides of the same coin, or are they separate organizations?
If not connected, understanding comes.
If related - why food and trade enterprise known in the city for its service and quality degraded to the rhetoric of the stall at the Kazan railway station?
Rhetoric because, I repeat, this is the third time that this happens to me.
I don't rule out that this isn't just happening to me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I have the impression that she acts on intuition.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please describe the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to service.
We really like the circus, we go there since our childhood.
I saw the numbers with Yu. Nikulin himself.
And now with children, nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, the programs too.
The seating arrangement is very convenient.
You can see the arena from almost anywhere and the backs of the front seats do not interfere with you.
The circus is very intimate, family!
this time went to the New Year's program.
A little upset.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I'd like a show with tricks and more animals.
Too bad you can't take pictures with the animals in the foyer now.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
And overall a very nice place!!
I wish you prosperity and delight us with your numbers!!!
I liked the developer Oddelstroy, chooses good places for the construction of residential complexes.
They use quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before buying, we were invited to see the complex, when there were not even walls, so that you could see everything live, although how many apartments we considered and no developer offered us this.
Favourite ski resort of Russia!
The most exciting is the slightly dense woods e, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks as for me boring and short.
The longest on sector e, there are even less.
But overall there is a great atmosphere, many different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing mood is guaranteed!
Great master Perry!
She did everything as quickly and qualitatively as possible, the salon is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a cloakroom and water.
Disgusting service.
The second time I come for the order to the time of readiness, which is indicated in the application and wait at the window sill more than 30 minutes your order.
Today in business such a service is unacceptable!
The answer is that we are trying.
At the cash desk even without apologies, just - we are not guilty, it's the program.
Neither to call to warn, no other technical possibilities of communication with regular previously loyal customers you did not find.
"Try" impotent, and business should work.
Thank you, everyone. Let's go.
We will not order more from you and recommend even more.
Spoiled mood, waiting for guests, apologies of the hostess - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
Ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
The car was expected to receive a month after 3-3.5 (as agreed), but the fact was 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus (Lithuania performed).
In the end, the car is very satisfied, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and normal human attitude.
Thank you again!
Rented a house for 4 days for 3 people.
The cottages are clean, cozy, warm (even very), the cottage has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all the necessary utensils.
Detergent and sponge are available.
Of the disadvantages can be distinguished if not too little space in the bathroom terribly small shower.
Storage space for snowboards or skis is not provided, and the things to dry especially nowhere, had to take the owners dryer and shove it instead of a chair, and put under it a heater.
And so in general a good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes sufficient for the needs of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There's wine and beer for those who want to drink.
Center of Moscow, I recommend
Wonderful place with very polite staff, will definitely come again.
On site there are all necessary facilities, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good renovation and all amenities.
Beautiful and aesthetic place, walked during a visit to Kaliningrad.
I really liked, and Russia in miniature, and Lakes Park and landscape.
In winter many natural slides for children)
Very cool shop of tobacco and hookahs)
Constantly buying here, the prices are low, and the quality at the level!
Very responsive staff, will suggest and answer all your questions)
I recommend this store to everyone! ❤️
The location is convenient.
For me personally normal.
Served quickly, if any of the visitors do not stumble.
Recording is convenient.
The staff is attentive, will suggest, direct, advise even if you came not in the reception days.
In principle, normal.
Great guys!
Thank you very much!
Everything was done quickly, the prices are adequate compared to other services.
I thought I'd throw away the remote, but they're so clever.
A big thank you to the young guys!
Ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery 2 hours on March 8.
Brought in 6 hours flowers in a package, as if stolen (hardly enough paper to wrap flowers).
Then, when the flowers were in the vase, I knew something was wrong.
Compared with the photo on the site and the color was not what I ordered.
Decided to recount and it turned out that tulips even number of 20 pieces.
Support in WhatsApp to my indignation about the color and the number of colors answered "apparently confused color".
The next day I wrote again and I was offered a refund of 15%.
This seems to me to be an extreme degree of insolence and probably falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a statement to the tax office about the fact that I was refused a check.
The Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next.
I do not recommend anyone to contact this organization.
I &apos;ve been going to Samira for more than 10 years, to dye and cut my hair.
I want to cancel The professionalism of the master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the wishes of the client, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
All relatives and loved ones boldly recommend this master.
All her work is always done at the highest level!!!’
A huge thank you to Master Samir 😍
Welcome was in this game club, I can say the prices are excellent, many gaming computers, also has drinks and food.
Of the disadvantages of some keyboards are broken flying buttons, if you take the "normal gameplay" then the computers pull badly: (
Therefore, the assessment 4
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to practice in his group, and mom in the evening to fitbox.
The administrators are super-attentive, the trainers are professional.
Organize themed holidays for children, keep track of cleanliness and exercise equipment.
It's nice to walk and exercise.
A 6-year-old child already holds the punch well, strong OFP.
Recommended for children, moms and dads)
The best masters!
Irina is just gold!!
Work performs qualitatively, caring, everything clarifies.
With girls you can always talk about something!
It was the third time.
I'll never regret it!
Finally I can grow hair after lightening!!!
Vita is also studying color.
That is why she will soon be able to combine blonde with keratin!
And your hair will say THANK YOU 🥰🥰
Master receiver Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, explained clearly everything that is part of the regular TO.
Also during the repair of my car provided all assistance.
And also thanks to master Valeriy Ushakov for careful and professional work.
He was ready to answer any question.
Works carried out qualitatively.
The only thing that was confusing when signing up for TO was insufficiently correct information on the regulations of works, when appearing for TO the regulation was more clearly explained.
I would like to express my deep appreciation to the Administration.
I needed a very rare certificate for the guardianship authorities to approve the real estate transaction, the employees were very friendly and helped to form this certificate, although they could refuse, as it is not their responsibility.
Thank you very much!
Very nice people work here.
Wonderful, soulful, polite employees, did not regret that came to this hairdresser! 👍
Master Nahida made a flawless shading, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend everyone❤️
I really liked the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
To the 800th anniversary restored, inside everything is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on a tour, it was great.
And I definitely recommend the Russian body of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection
With Olea known for more than 3 years, use the services regularly.
During this time, we have seen how Olya develops in her favorite business, constantly learns new things and expands the space for four-legged friends, which only causes admiration and trust.
Always with a calm soul leave our stall.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be picked up / transported by zootaxi.
And also bring clean and delicious)
It's a fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for the care and attentive personal attitude to our pets 🐶💜
Restaurant Sity Losy is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They cook delicious dishes.
The menu is varied.
Before visiting it is advisable to book seats in advance, especially on Fridays!
A nice well-kept zoo.
Less Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
Were on weekdays-entrance adult 300₽, schoolchild 170.
People were few, with pleasure walked, looked at the animals.
The moray eel impressed)
In Moscow, by the way, he was not seen.
On the territory there are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices, toilet clean free, also seen a charging station for phones.
In general, I recommend 👍
Salon at the highest level!!!
I am very satisfied with the services of cosmetologist Kuznetsova Natalia, I go only to her.
I do various facial cleansing - both hardware and mechanical.
100% satisfied.
Master of his craft👍
Everything tells in detail about the characteristics of the skin, picked up cosmetics caring for my skin type, just perfect.
I walk now happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you Natalia!!!
A great club with a huge space, swimming pool, sauna, hammam and great trainers!
Of the minuses a huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the locker room area.
It feels like they come to the club as a public bath!
Special emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting at 19:00 people are very much!
I put a three and only thanks to the first visit, when I got to the consultant, if I'm not mistaken Timur, but I may be wrong.
Formed everything quickly, told everything +/-, everything clearly, the son also decided to form a card, and unfortunately the consultants are busy with their business, customers are waiting, the son approached the consultant in the end, which is all up to the lamp, several times otzrdil6v negotiating room, something funny discussing, in the end the son left, having formed nothing, forgiveness consultant said, well, you want, as you want, as I was present at this meeting, was surprised.
New office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and such attitude.
Too bad that the first impression was overridden, now visiting another branch, and there attitude to customers does not depend on changing employees.
The choice is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to the appearance of wrinkles), the staff knows their assortment, help in choosing styles.
You can dress and slim and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
Located near the subway, even a small parking lot.
We highly recommend!
Was in September, celebrated his birthday.
In principle, the service and quality of food everything liked: low prices, medium-sized portions, so you can eat, or order again.
The only complaint is the reservation.
When I ordered, I specified the number and everything that was required, after which the bot immediately called to check the phone.
There's nothing else.
When I came to the restaurant, it turned out that the table was not booked.
Luckily, there were free places and we were able to accommodate.
And so, in fact, a very good restaurant with an excellent ratio "Price / Quality".
I recommend it!
I went for a cleanse this past weekend.
It is the first time I see such an organized staff, which treated many of my questions with the utmost care, suggested how and what is better to do for further treatment of the dental cavity.
I sincerely recommend, the only clinic where they do not want to heat up for money in my memory.
Nice shopping center.
It's all there!
Large assortment of goods.
Variety of shops.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
Don't go to that store anymore.
We bought a washing machine, they said we're out of town, so we'll drive it.
manager in the hall said where to drive to the warehouse, the question "load"? said yes.))
at the warehouse took out without a box, asked why? answered that so all load.
When I insisted, they put in two pieces of plywood, and said, &quot; &quot; OK. &quot; &quot;
loading in the trailer refused, saying it's not their job, load yourself, they have delivery)))
When I said that I would then refuse the order at all, they said "yes as you want, we don't care", in the end one still descended to that, to go down the ramp and help my father stuff the car into the trailer.
with such rude service encountered for the first time.
Nice shopping center Clean neat.great selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema "Cosmic" children's entertainment center "Nevidalia".
On the ground floor a large hypermarket "Lenta".
Convenient, large parking convenient location.
A nice supermarket of cosmetics, underwear and home goods.
Varied assortment, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the choice, advise.
Everyone will find something for themselves.
It's a nice place to spend the evening.
The staff is very friendly and helpful.
I advise everyone never make a mistake in the choice.The best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be super.
I recommend visiting)
We are grateful to Marina, who was our funeral agent.
Coming to us on call, she took on the decision of all issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was always in touch and informed how things are going.
Thanks to her, we accompanied a loved one with dignity.
Everything was formalized, clearly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, perfectly understanding the state in which the loved ones are, gave advice on how to be better and just humanly sympathized with us.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
Taking advantage of many good reviews, I turned to "RemStirMash" and I was appointed master Alexander.
He started the conversation by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready to serve.
All discussed and appointed time - 14.00.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the master and a statement about the fact that he will not be able to come, a complex request (how? And where is "perfectly free?") And, if he can, then instead of the appointed 14.00 will appear after 18.00.
We agreed to meet again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time another master calls and says that instead of Alexander can come, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
One and a half days of empty waiting, all the planned activities on the side!
In short, the smart master Ivan arrived, fixed the breakdown, for which I thank him.
So do not fall for empty promises and do not waste your time.
The evening observations did not live up to expectations.
First there was a small lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked at the telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children climbed to look several times, adults crowded and could not let others see.
The objects we looked at in the telescope were the size of an ordinary star, and without a telescope can be seen for free.
The girl answered the questions not very accessible, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear why 600p.
Awesome place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in town, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
Price is average.
Sit, eating 2-3 dishes for two (very large portions) + cocktail, about 2500 p 👌
There are interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Boracho highly recommended to try.
Price 420 p for 0.5 l.
And in general in the restaurant very delicious cuisine, I do not know how others, and I really liked it, I will advise friends to go there)
Great store, buying goods from them for a long time, since the opening.
Good quality goods.
Bought a mixer, five years have passed, and it works properly and in good condition.
Therefore, when doing global repairs in the apartment everything needed was taken here.
Excellent filling!!!
Located very conveniently, there are both the center and the side of the area, generally convenient)!
Gas quality is good, refueling 2 times a week for more than 2 years, no problems, the price is excellent!!!
Eagles by card and for cash, liters do not cheat.
Shop, liked it!
You can choose any model, at a democratic price, and for any purpose!
Staff, always ready to help in the choice.
Bought a laptop for my daughter to study, because her laptop got covered.
Helped, picked, gave a warranty (month) Thank you! 👍
There is a sommelier.
He helped with the choice of wine, because in such a large menu it is difficult to understand yourself.
Experience working with an interesting, charming sommelier Vasily, such as in Moscow is not enough.
Eat cod - magical, respect the cook.
Children's menu as everywhere: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. My ate pizza, it's here FIRE!
With truffles appreciated adults, and children with ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - it's a bomb, soft, juicy, fragrant.
Staff is good, all smiling, friendly.
We enjoyed it.
The brand new WB pick-up point is conveniently located.
Opening hours, from 10.00 to 21.00, without weekends and holidays.
Inside the PVZ there are fitting booths.
Very nice place.
There are real professionals who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat in WhatsApp for informative communication.
Fast delivery.
It is good that the product can be viewed and tried immediately.
It's nice to be close to home.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything that is stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, a large selection of dishes for every taste.
Convenient entry, its own parking near the entrance.
Hard 5.
Wonderful puppet theatre.
We often go to different performances.
Today we were at the show "The Frog Queen".
At the moment, from children's performances, this is the best.
It was very interesting, lots of puppets, special effects.
Even the son of 14 years, went just for the company, and said that very good performance.
Rested with my husband 10 days in January 2023.
The rest went on "5", liked everything!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival called, clarified at what time to wait for us, gave information about the cost of transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 price 850p), arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, the barrier let without any problems.
Administrative building nearby, arranged quickly, 15-20 minutes.
In all buildings there is an elevator - it's a big plus!
The 2-bed room is spacious, the floors in the room and in the bathroom are warm (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in the 5th building).
Furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, refrigerator is not quite small, even a freezer.
There are lots of green plants in Block 5.
Everything is clean, change towels and linen at your request, but if you do not ask to change, it is still changed on the 4th day, linen of good quality.
The territory is well-kept, everywhere benches, clean paths, beautiful lighting in the evening.
A minibus runs to and from the beach every 30 minutes.
The public transport stop is 5 minutes away.
In the dining room friendly guys, always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but here who goes for what, we all perfectly suited, and the choice and quality, there was always fish and chicken and bitches or etc., vegetables for garnish every day, baking its delicious, more than 4 drinks, coffee grain, for breakfast always bake pancakes, only cheese and sausage not very.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, temperature 11- 16 C °, sunshine.
Everything I liked, really relaxed.
There is a desire to come again and precisely in January, when few vacationers)).
Too bad that the pool can not be launched into operation and fitness complex.
Thank you to the whole team of the sanatorium for their coherent and quality work!
We've been going to "Polot" since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
Everything really likes it, the trainer praises) this is the main thing.
We go to Valeria Nikolayevna Pleshkova!)
I never thought my daughter would be so flexible!
Wandering through the streets of St. Petersburg, I and my friends decided to take a look at this promising establishment - and did not miss!
Prices are very affordable, and incredibly delicious pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, even the crust remains.
Pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in a word, recommend:)
It so happened that I came to the Tomarovsky hospital with high blood pressure and high heartbeat.
And was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, more wiped windowsills, furniture, doors.
Food deethic, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 a.m. they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is responsive, they all put intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
While the infusions are on, they'll come in, ask how you're feeling...
Previously, I had to do ultrasound of the heart, but so - for the first time (unfortunately, I do not know the name of the doctor, a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetochiny Claudia Fedorovna!
A real professional: attentive, literate, gives an exhaustive answer to any question; chose the dosage and drugs, from which the pressure and heartbeat were normalized, which I could not achieve before after turning to other doctors.
Thank you very much to the chief physician Mevsha Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the harmonious work of the hospital!!!
Thank you to the medical staff, and nurses, and cooks!
When visiting the customer service, the impression was good.
In the lobby met the administrator.
Literate and polite specialists promptly and patiently help customers with all the questions asked.
The specialist helped me with the application and clarified my question.
For a small shop very even a good selection of goods.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, chemicals for the home, various trifles.
Open 24 hours a day, which is very convenient, always friendly staff
It's great when the city has a place where you can ride from the mountains.
The lifts bugel and on weekends of course the queue gets 40 seconds descent and 5-10 minutes queue.
But overall Cool, immersion in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if on the roads dirt and moisture.
Turned to the service for repair of the iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
Contacted directly with the master Alexander, who explained all the subtleties of repair and immediately indicated the price framework.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done qualitatively.
The masters are very pleasant to communicate with, they will show and tell you everything.
However, when replacing parts, the camera was hit, lost focus.
Immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was fixed in the shortest possible time, everything works properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is pleasant to have a dialogue.
Prices, compared to other services, acceptable, have.
If repair is needed again - be sure to contact!
Scalable, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the condition requires close, prompt and qualitative attention of restorers.
Therefore 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the keepers
Excellent g/c
Responsive concierges, garbage removed, clean and beautiful in the territory, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
Opened in our area a good, cozy place to rest.
There are all the necessary shops.
Killer and varied in terms of food food court.
The tables are arranged in cozy areas.
No boredom.
Well, we've been, we've tried...
The interior has nothing in common with the Italian cozy cafe has...
Space is very limited, tables are rectangular, like in the dining room.
Pizza... well, who has not tried better, so I like it seemed somewhat faceless.
Not very much liked that the waiter is always behind your back and your interlocutor opposite almost always looks in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly's, yeah, delicious.
Will not come here again and will not recommend to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best hairdresser I've ever had my hair cut and colored.
She does everything very carefully and qualitatively, I go to her with pleasure, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I take my daughter only to Lena.
The atmosphere of the salon is amazing.
Thank you very much!
We are from Nizhny, broke down on the way, good people from KatResurs reacted quickly and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, more such good people!
And in the service there is clean and good!
We came to the concert of Sergei Chigrakov.
Great concert venue, great sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come this year to the planned concerts.
Quiet place, wonderful Georgian restaurant, on weekends and holidays plays live music!
The staff is nice and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The highest rating, I love this place ❤
Park in the center of the city, very easy to reach.
The park is clean, there is a place for children and adults.
But there is no sand on the playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football pitch, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there are more advantages in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are foods that can only be bought in the Crossroads.
The staff is friendly.
I didn't eat bad food.
Frequent promotions and discounts.
It's good to be close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
Were in the bar twice, everything I liked, polite staff, delicious food and the most important thing - great music, DJs know their stuff.
The only thing, the second time disappoints the soloist of the group "Hands Up Band".
Not only does he sing not very well, to say the least, but he also reads the lyrics of most songs from the phone, especially when it was the songs of the group "Hands Up".
Somehow it is illogical (performing in the bar Hands Up, in the group Hands Up Band).
Rested in early March.
Nice hotel, nice rooms.
In honor of the birthday gave a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Cleaning in the room every day.
Refill of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and towel change.
The breakfasts are just crazy.
There's a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order a meal from the restaurant in the room, pay for service 20% above.
The restaurant prices are slightly overpriced.
Tastes like three plus.
The aquapark was included in the price of accommodation.
The aquapark itself can not be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was just a bomb.
Everything is great, but the departure a little disappointed: no goodbye, no good road.
The employee at the entrance did not even help open the door seeing women with a lot of bags and suitcases.
This needs to be worked on to keep the mark.
A great place to get together with friends to take a bath.
Large and comfortable sauna, billiards, outdoor pool, karaoke.
Delicious food, fresh drinks)
The workshop is on a level!
In a short time repaired already 3 pairs of shoes (2 husband and 1 wife).
It's okay.
The quality of work is high.
Special thanks to the master for the careful attitude and quality of work!
A wonderful school of basketball!
The son walks 5 months and he really likes it, every training is looking forward.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and soulful atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff will go, order through the Internet myself.
Excellent location of the store.
Plus there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good
Good AB store - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria with several tables.
I'm often there - everything suits!
Nice pool!
I am specifically about "Frog", our trainer Anastasia Vitalyevna really likes the child and professional!!
Changing rooms are clean, water is warm, hairdryers are available!
I love the bakery cake, service, croissants, breakfasts and coffee always at its peak.
But alas, not this time, ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the counter never made coffee, until I reminded them, made, drinking impossible, smells and remains the aftertaste of spoiled milk, decided not to drink and just left.
Last time in my coffee was long black hair, replaced.
Please be more attentive, as I am a returning guest here, even after such incidents.
Great eyebrows are here!
Victoria perfectly adjusts, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which removes all the fluff, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected according to the type of hair and skin, thanks to which the paint lasts a long time.
Better not make eyebrows!
Thank you very much for organizing the move of my mother!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very clearly, quickly, qualitatively.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is top notch.
We have been treating teeth with the whole family in Novodent for a long time.
Recently treated teeth son 8 years, everything went just great, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You do not have to wait long, there are no queues because the reception by prior arrangement.
For me the most delicious shawarma in Tambov only here, I am not a fan of shawarma, but when you want something harmful only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat with lots of filling.
And I don't know why, but it never leaks.
Often when you eat shaurma lower already do not eat as there is a lot of sauce water well in short fuuu...., but not here.
That's why you guys are the best🙂
They have good teachers.
The canteen always has fresh food.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held during the school year
Nice store, polite staff, good assortment.
However, the big downside is that the goods that are brought, apparently, destroyed right in the hall.
Sometimes there is little space to walk between the rows, and also not very pleasant when the product is directly on the floor, without pallets, but it is rather a comment to the organization, not to a specific store
A wonderful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict magnificence, carefully maintained.
I got a double pleasure from the concert, largely thanks to the atmosphere of the cultural house.
As we waited for the beginning in the lobby, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that it was indeed an exit into the light.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
Completely by accident got into this online store of auto parts.
Called, indicated the wincode, said wait)
After 10 minutes called back, offered several options.
Since the car personal-working to save was not and asked to order a good set of clutch LUK.
Another 5 minutes later called back and said that for you good news.
If you do not take the entire basket + disc + squeegee, and take LUK set basket + disc and separately squeegee LUK, then it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
Taking the clutch went to the service.
When removing the gearbox, it was found that the flywheel is still needed and the sooner the better.
I already knew where to go), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment on the call (the first time also paid upon receipt).
The next day the flywheel was on his hands.
The car is happy with the new flywheel and clutch, I am glad that everything came quickly, that went to meet.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop
New Year's party was a success, but with nuances.
I booked a double table, it turned out that I sat for a 4-seater.
But don't worry.
It's just weird they didn't warn me.
Kitchen for four, the fish did not succeed at all.
The host with contests made on school-level turnpoint, to be honest, not very.
BUT about the music everything is perfect.
The atmosphere was great.
Everything else seems to be pickiness.
Thank you for the event
I leave my review with words of thanks to all the staff of the maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
In this institution work only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God.
Both in the OB department, in the maternity ward and in the postpartum ward.
But I am especially grateful to Kotlyarova E.Y., the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., the midwife in the maternity ward, thank you very much for your help in the birth of my daughter, for your good heart, for your great professionalism.
It's a beautiful store.
Large assortment of balls, always fast order formation and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, with left always with great taste, always fresh flowers.
Visited the establishment on the recommendation.
The food is amazing, no program, a little cheeky waiters, but we were in a wonderful composition with children and celebrated an important event, were friendly.
There was no fire plateau, the children were waiting.
You can go for good food.
