Diego Cocca appointed as Mexico coach
In the summer of 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup with the United States and Canada for the first time with 48 teams. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after his early exit from the World Cup in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not among the favourites for the post until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November.
Geesthacht: New bed signs to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The action "Geesthacht blüht auf" also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blüht auf" (Geesthacht blooms) is an action of the Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, daycare centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted in the ground since 2015. Goal: In the Geesthacht city area, extensive flower islands are to be created, on which insects can find food at any time.
In order to ensure that the initiative is not only an action by nature conservationists and the city’s environmental department, but also attracts wide circles into the private gardens, explanatory panels about the plants are placed again and again. About 50 signs have been placed so far. Passers-by should be able to inform themselves in this way about what is currently blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will plant at home in a targeted manner.
In the first week of January was already season start at the Wildhasel
Recent additions to the pedestrian zone are shrubs such as winter cherry and winter snowball, which have been in the soil of the containers on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, showing the first delicate white and pink blossoms without leaves, and have recently been provided with additional signs. "The winter cherry is a very broad-bush shrub and can grow to between two metres tall and three metres wide," reads one of the information boards on the pedestrian zone.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that it is not only the bed plants that are now showing blossoms. In the first week of January, the wild hazel season already started, and it is blooming particularly profusely on the Richtweg near the slope, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102: "Stepping keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of them when he looks down from the sky at Munich's Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 3 p.m. three ladies meet for a quick tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, pardon young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the Munich native (born January 15, 1921) from the Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is THE highlight of the week: "Dancing and step is my life, I can't imagine it without it."
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also dance with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was rescued in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today one would say a musical actress, who worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life dancing, acting and singing."
At 79, Elfriede Widmann is like a chick in the circle of tap dancers: "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl," she says.
Wikipedia: The tap dance was developed in the 19th century in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, which are more durable than the initially used wooden soles, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing, which fit the optical impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is tap dance and the French claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced the tap dance. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a well audible sound while dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at the Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, we welcome big and small, old and young."
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Movement keeps me young," says the 102-year-old to BILD.Her advice to everyone: "Sports, healthy food and no alcohol."
Analogue in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
With the progress of digitalization, the desire for analog is growing again in some
The rapid pace at which our everyday lives have become digital leaves us little time to set up rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three possibilities. Either you belonged to the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you belonged to those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call there for a bottle of Radeberger with the relatives. Or you went to a telephone booth. Unforgettable the smell of the plastic handset and the clicking of the small coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the face of the other person when calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
Next steps in Moldova: 14 days for a new government
In Moldova, President Maia Sandu has entrusted former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with forming a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert, who was one of the president’s advisors, has now 14 days to do so.
After only a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita had unexpectedly resigned.The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was hated by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifice".
Moldova is a neighbouring country of Ukraine and suffers from the economic consequences of the war: inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In Parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority of 63 out of 101 seats, so confirming the new head of government and his cabinet should not be a problem.
However, the pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while the pro-Russian ones - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023, Veitshöchheim will be celebrating again. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities did not wait long.
The father of the state, Markus Söder, did not appear as Moses, as his costume suggests, but rather as the tribal elder of Bavaria. At his side was his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria’s Minister of the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the children’s hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea, Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja came to Franconia.
Completely off the beaten track: Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, is headed into outer space.
The president of the state parliament, Ilse Aigner, chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria’s health minister Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder aka Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's gold boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne, who wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff at carnival: Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, with his wife Gerswid at his side.
On the waltz: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays tribute to craftsmanship with his costume, and his partner Tanja Schweiger, district councillor of Regensburg, does the same.
Of course, the political opposition could not be missed.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
The SPD group leader enjoys hiking: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairwoman Ronja Endres.
FDP group leader Martin Hagen and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, the group chairman in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a pantomime.
Nuremberg’s Mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione, who is also a fan of the Harry Potter series.
Agile as a bee: Bavaria’s Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back in the 1920s: Eva Majuntke, the legal director of the BR, Katja Wildermuth, the BR's artistic director, and Björn Wilhelm, the BR's cultural programme director.
A small side kick against the climate activists by the Franconian Tatort-commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The first mayor of Veitshöchheim, Jürgen Götz, and his wife, Julia, were also present.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in World Cup sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and continues to catch up with his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals.
Hardly anyone doubts that in the chase race number three will follow. In the pursuit Bö is once again the clear favourite, his running form is outstanding, so that he can compensate for shooting errors to a certain extent with frightening ease.
Meanwhile, things were not going well for Doll again. After losing all chances of a medal with a penalty round in the mixed relay and finishing sixth three days later, three penalty rounds in the recumbent shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen six years ago, he won surprisingly narrowly with 0.7 seconds ahead of Bö. It was one of Doll’s only three career successes to stand on the podium this winter so far. The Olympic eight of Beijing left after his weak performance without words and initially did not give any interviews. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Championship debutant David Zobel took 35th place.
Biden receives Lula: "Must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, focused on the value of democracy, with both leaders looking back on their predecessors.
During a visit to his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, US President Joe Biden stressed the preservation of democratic values.
"The strength of democracy in our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength," Lula said, referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years."
Bolsonaro’s supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the government headquarters in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a grim reminder of the storming of the U.S. Capitol more than two years ago, in which supporters of then President Donald Trump forcefully entered the parliament in Washington.
"His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening," he said. "It sounds familiar to me," Biden replied, an obvious allusion to his predecessor, Donald Trump.
Short note about the press - the Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF hunting posters, which showed the members of the Red Army Faction released for denunciation and shooting?
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which already existed before Corona, public sentiment was thus created against the most dangerous opponents of the Federal Republic of Germany; let’s say the bourgeois democracy, let’s say the late capitalist society (nothing here about the really dangerous ones in pinstripe suit and tie).
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more after Raudis in the S-Bahn or masturbators in the park, gives a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends.Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery.Of course the StZ is poorly informed, because there are perhaps more "Russian friends" in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that is not the point, but: In place 1 to 5 (!) is Ms. Wagenknecht, then follows Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don’t know anyone around me who reads this paper anymore, and if they do, it’s high time they did. We’ve reached the known level, where there’s nothing below it.
And at the latest now, well dialectically, Ms. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all still not completely demented, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people (and here no more differentiation is necessary).
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. "I can confirm that my client has filed an application for the annulment of his civil partnership with the competent court through his family lawyer.
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were together for 35 years, and rumors of separation have been circulating for about a year. After his participation in the Dschungelcamp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved out of their house in the Pfalz to Berlin, according to various media reports.
SS-Massakers in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
A memorial center was set up in 1999 in the ruined village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins have been preserved. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended France’s values, Macron said. He also contributed to Franco-German peace. The survivor had, among other things, promoted Franco-German youth meetings.
A curved location for 14 houses: Everyone knows everyone in Homeien
LZ-Serie Nordlippische Weiler: In Homeien, three or four generations often live under one roof, where the inhabitants find pure idyll. In summer, up to 300 motorcycles per day rush along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some also come back immediately.
Deutsche Bank chief Christian Sewing says further interest rate hikes are "absolutely necessary" in the fight against high inflation. "Inflationary risks remain high," Sewing told the "Welt am Sonntag" newspaper. "Energy costs could easily rise again, and the opening-up of China could give prices a temporary boost."
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and indicated a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on 16 March. The key interest rate in the euro area is now at 3.0 percent.The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can dampen demand and counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher borrowing rates can cause investment to be postponed and thus weaken economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted eurozone countries such as Italy. "The consequences of sustained high inflation are much more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course, we must keep that in mind, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB’s target of 2 percent inflation in the euro area over the medium term has been a long way off for months. In January, inflation weakened again, but consumer prices in the now 20-country currency area were still 8.5 percent higher than a year earlier.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can afford less for a euro.Strongly rising energy prices, which drive inflation significantly, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "collapse sooner or later," Sewing, who is also president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB), warned. "This is where I see the biggest threat to the German economy right now, but I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung is hoping for a broad debate on the "German pace" for infrastructure projects proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialogue about it, and it will perhaps also be a little more controversial," he told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will emerge with which things do not necessarily have to go as fast as with the LNG terminals that were commissioned around the turn of the year - but neither as slow as before.
In mid-December, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened after a ten-month planning and construction period. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas deliveries. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken of a new "Germany-Tempo" on the occasion. In addition, the Federal Government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it comes down to it, but that should not automatically mean that from now on we will always act so categorically and, for example, put a windmill in the neighbor's garden against his will," said Hartung. Therefore, there must still be a negotiation process as to what one finds right and wrong as a society.
In the past, it was tried with the classic set of rules and failed. "We should think again about whether the previous approach was so right, perhaps we have exaggerated with the set of rules and made it too complicated for ourselves."
In view of the many open tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, Hartung said he did not envy the Federal Government and the companies involved: "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Union warns against dismantling of the Bayer Group
"From the employees' point of view, Bayer, with its three pillars, is exactly in the right position to face the challenges of the future," Francesco Grioli, a member of the union's executive board and a member of Bayer's supervisory board, told the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
"The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy that is based on risk diversification and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism," he said, referring to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health sector with over-the-counter drugs and the agricultural business.
The controversial chief Werner Baumann will step down this summer and will be replaced by Bill Anderson, former chief pharmaceutical officer of Swiss rival Roche, who is expected to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has long been criticized. The 2018 takeover of US seed manufacturer Monsanto for $63 billion hangs behind the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusener had brought expensive legal disputes about alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate into the house. The Bayer share was in decline for years. In 2019, the shareholders even denied the CEO the discharge at the Annual General Meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann is not seeking a renewal of his contract, which is supposed to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors have been putting pressure on him, and recently several activist Anglo-Saxon investors, such as Bluebell Capital, have joined in.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the consumer health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the Rheinische Post, but he does not see a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science as feasible.
Hundreds of thousands to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
The French want to take to the streets again on Saturday against the planned pension reform.
Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to take to the streets on Saturday to protest against the government’s pension reform.
Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate nationwide on Saturday against President Emmanuel Macron’s planned pension reform. For the fourth time, trade unions are mobilizing against the central government’s plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. More than a million people have already taken to the streets twice and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests.
Already, many people in France work beyond the age of 62 if they have not contributed long enough for a non-deductible pension by reaching the age limit. In many strenuous professions, people could hardly work any longer, say the opponents of the reform.In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved retirement and not completely wear out their health in the job.
Macron: Impending deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with a threatening deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, workers will have to pay their contributions for an increasing number of pensioners. In order to keep the level of pensions stable, the population will have to work a little more. Critics doubt the government’s calculations and demand that the state find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But it is not only the retirement age that the government wants to raise. The increase in the period of contribution required for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to about 1,200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of the most important projects of President Macron. During the corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was aborted, and even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron had tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protests and strikes were certain.
Without an absolute majority in parliament, Macron’s camp hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced their support, but some of the MPs, even from Macron’s own party, still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a narrow vote, Macron’s concern at the moment seems to be paralyzing strikes.Ahead of Saturday’s renewed demonstrations, the president said he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers so that they would proceed calmly and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sun in high altitudes
A powerful high-pressure area is over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany.Does this mean that a lot of sunshine can be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected until at least the middle of the week. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. "Although this high will shift a little to the east over the course of next week, it will continue to determine the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel: "Such a high can even be quite common and give people in the lowlands a sad grey fog for days, while in the high altitudes of the middle mountains there is pure sun."
From the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, according to the DWD, it can also rain a little. Especially at the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens up during the day and the sun appears more and more frequently. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily cloudy or covered with high fog.
"On Monday, the gradually increasing sun will nibble again on the high fog and can dissolve it more and more in the course of the day," says the meteorologist. At the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the middle mountains and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day long, elsewhere it will have to fight its way through the high fog cover.
On Tuesday, in some lowlands, there may again be only stubborn dissolution of fog or high fog. Otherwise, the weather will be clear after the dissolution of the fog. In the highlands, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and at the edge of the Alps, the sun will shine all day according to the forecasts. The temperatures will climb to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominatrix struggles: No more World Cup medal for Goggia
The defeated top favourite Sofia Goggia has been very disappointed after her elimination in the downhill race of the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't perform as well as I could," the 30-year-old Italian told ZDF after being knocked out after a goal, after she barely managed to avoid a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the season's six races in this discipline. After winning gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won silver at the 2022 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing. Goggia, who is known for her risky riding, has yet to win a World Cup medal in her flagship discipline.
"I thought I was in a good mood. It was a matter of hundredths of a second," Goggia said after Switzerland's Jasmine Flury's surprise win in Méribel, France. "I'm disappointed. I gave everything. But that's life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal expected by all the experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not."
Girl missing in Berlin: Who saw Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since 10 February.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen at the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station on Friday and the police are asking for clues to her whereabouts.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin police ask the public for help in the search for a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school together with other children in the direction of the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station on February 10, 2023 at around 12:30 p.m. She was last seen at the S-Bahn station. The child has been in Berlin as a refugee since April 2022 and has only very little knowledge of the German language and the local area.

Selenskyj and ministers against Russia's participation in the Olympics
Sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by calling for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.
They agreed on a joint telephone conference to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Sports Ministry said on its website.
"We call for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
"It was a very productive meeting, and I made the UK's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus should not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this issue," Frazer said.
At an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking officials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Zelenskyy said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, even a neutral flag is soaked with blood and cannot be worn.
Ukraine threatens with boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a belligerent because the country provides military bases for Russian troops to attack. Selenskyj called on officials to work to protect Olympic principles and prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions, and renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its honesty".
The reason for the conference was the announcement by the IOC to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions.Ukraine also threatens a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
"In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to competition. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to enjoy the unconditional solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes are the wrong way to go," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said.
"Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population," Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) said at the end of January. "Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum," Faeser said.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from participating in many international sporting competitions, but the IOC is seeking to allow athletes from both countries to return to the international sporting scene under a neutral flag, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently said that an exclusion "on the basis of a passport or place of birth" violates the prohibition of discrimination.
Acknowledging where it happens
"Hey, geiler Hintern!", whistling after the fool in a tight sexy costume and shouting obscene sayings: All this falls under the concept of "Catcalling" (i.e. cat calls). Behind the term hides nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public space.
Half of vehicles lost? : US sees Moscow's tank stock severely decimated
Half of vehicles lost? US sees Moscow's tank stock severely decimated
The Pentagon estimates that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war, "half of the main stock."
The Russian army has already lost half of its tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, according to estimates by the US Department of Defense. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Secretary of State for International Security Affairs at the US Department of Defense.
At an online event of the think tank Center for a New American Security, Wallander did not provide further information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates.
Ukraine is expected to receive tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised to deliver Challenger 2 tanks to Kiev by March. Germany, in a coalition with other countries, plans to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The US has also promised a battalion of 31 Abrams tanks.
Russia wants to make up for it
In response to the Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev promised the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy begged abroad for planes, missiles, tanks," Medvedev, who is now deputy head of the Russian Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more closely aligned with the needs of the army, for example by obliging individual industries to supply the armed forces.
Controversy over appointments at the Army
The post, which will be held by the former director of the Military History Museum (HGM), Christian Ortner, was not advertised. The personnel representative of the Academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects corruption and abuse of office.Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the procedure.
A tender was not necessary because the appointment was made to a previously vacant post, said the minister. "Speculations of a liberal personnel representative" she would not comment. Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the head of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's dealings with Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of harassment.
Jedlaucnik also doubts the suitability of Ortner, who is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands an explanation from Tanner about the "unusual ordering procedure." The decision has the "appearance of postenschacher," says SPÖ defense spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos ask Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP "continues to be in the swamp of corruption up to its neck," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools go to their knees before costs
Unlike the state capital, Wasungen, Thuringia’s carnival capital, wants to keep the traditional carnival procession. However, the higher costs for security, among other things, are difficult to cope with in Wasungen, says carnival president Marcel Kißling.
In Brandenburg, no carnival parades will be cancelled. The "Zug der fröhlichen Leute" in Cottbus, probably once again the largest in Eastern Germany, will take place for the first time after the pandemic.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We will carry out our event," says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen. But financial worries are also pressing here: If more sponsors were not found or the previous ones contributed even more, the reserves would have to be touched - "that is not possible every year." The deficit currently: about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: in the case of confectionery, there has been a price increase of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther of the Nuremberg Carnival Train Support Association. Luckily, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. Nevertheless, it is already clear that the move will be more expensive.
If you stand on the side of the road at the Rose Monday procession in the Rhineland, you could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some participants in the procession do not have as much with them. Camels or not, the crowd of visitors should be large: "I think if it does not rain out of buckets on the day, then we can certainly expect an increased crowd," says the Cologne procession leader Holger Kirsch.
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment on costs in detail, but the train is generally "deficitary", which is no secret.
Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Homemade Vodka
There is domestic beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then I discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can not notice a big difference in taste. The same applies to the vodka, which is widespread. They burn it here especially in the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. How much of it is consumed exactly in the former Soviet republics, no one knows. In Russia, the Minister of Health a few years ago claimed that consumption had fallen by a fabulous 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that you should be careful as a tourist. But that only applies if it goes into mass sale.
FC Hansa Rostock rewarded for high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Eating and drinking
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or drink a beer at the end of the day, you will find great restaurants in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the prelude to club parties.
Biathlon World Championships: President sees favourite victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal ceremony at the World Championships sprint in Oberhof, but there were two glimmers of hope in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was impossible to see from the stands of honour on Saturday whether the discs at the shooting range were really falling. "I had to get the results on my mobile phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile. He pointed out the fog that was constantly drawing into the stadium, which greatly impaired the view at the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed visiting the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, where he received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, biathlon has fascinated me," he revealed. He also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The completely renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions," said the athletes, with thanks to those who have worked here since the World Championships were awarded.
Once again, Norway’s Johannes Thingnes Bö was ahead of the competition. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds behind) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed Norway’s four-time victory.
One day after Denise Herrmann-Wick’s triumph, the local skiers could not intervene in the fight for the medals. Johannes Kühn took eighth place after a shooting error and with a lag of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two glimpses of light behind the grey veil. Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his failed mixed use on Wednesday, the Black Forester left five discs standing this time and disappeared as 55th deeply disappointed and without comment in the cockpit.
In front of 14,300 spectators, Bö had started the race with the number 1 and demonstrated this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However, he had the luck of the skilled on his last two standing shots; they landed on the edge of the discs and fell anyway.The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his brother, five years older: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will dominate Sunday's pursuit as well. In the women's race, however, the German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. "When you start with the number one, the goal is not to finish tenth. There is only full gas and attack to defend the number one," said sports director Felix Bitterling. The organisers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (13.25 and 15.30/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "Bee Swarm" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on referee ball.
Aggressively approaching players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to punish unsportsmanlike behaviour "consistently".
Top German referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the interaction on the pitch. "I think there are new ways of behaviour of the players, who surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur. "We discussed this during the winter break. We decided that we do not want to accept such unsportiness.
Mainz coach Bo Svensson was shown a red card in the Cup defeat against FC Bayern. Freiburg coach Christian Streich was shown a yellow-red card in the league defeat at Dortmund. "The behaviour of coaches also falls into the category of unsportsmanlike behaviour. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike behaviour has increased in this area as well, that the behaviour towards us referees has become a little more demanding or aggressive.
DFB chief referee Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out that the relationship between coaches and referees is generally good. "Overall, the relationship is good. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reaction.
"Conflicts can certainly arise from emotionality in the course of a match, but if emotionality spills over into personal insults, then you have to accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by the referee," Fröhlich said. In the most recent cases, the parties involved cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if a rethinking process could be set in motion, that such behaviour simply does not belong," Fröhlich said on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sport Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible impacts on another level. "Of course, incidents in professional football always have an impact. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviour," Fröhlich said.
Combined skiers Oftebro wins in Schonach
Jens Luraas Oftebro of Norway secured the victory after a jump from the normal hill and the 10 km long cross-country race ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter, while Kristjan Ilves of Estonia finished third.
The German combined team is not competing in the Black Forest in its best line-up. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not among them. They are training in Oberstdorf for the World Championships, which will take place from 21 February to 5 March in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home.
Seven slightly injured after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people have been slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on the Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), including two children. According to a police statement, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a driver hit a car from the back during a slight traffic jam and pushed it onto two other cars.
Finissage at the Marl Sculpture Museum
The initiators of the exhibition, Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right), stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition ends at the Marl Sculpture Museum, with some extras for the finale.
The closing ceremony of the exhibition "Wandgebunden" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarter of the Marl Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted over and the works of art will disappear, but a catalogue documenting the works created specifically for the Marl Museum will be presented on 12 February by the curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the closing event, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall art in the service of the community, using numerous pictorial examples to present the peculiarities of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and asking about the connections to this art form in the Federal Republic, with a focus on North Rhine-Westphalia from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator who earned her doctorate in 2013 on the wall paintings of the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching building-related art as well as art and institutional history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art at the building in North Rhine-Westphalia. After the lecture, the last curatorial tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists will be on site.
Arrest warrants issued after building collapses in Turkey
Judicial authorities in the Turkish earthquake region have issued warrants for the arrest of dozens of suspects in connection with construction defects that contributed to the collapse of buildings.
Istanbul. Dozens of arrest warrants have been issued in southern Turkey for possible construction defects after buildings collapsed during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, 33 people have been arrested, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The defendants are said to be responsible for construction defects that facilitated the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the Adana public prosecutor’s office is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of this investigation, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it was said. One of the defendants was reportedly arrested at the airport in Istanbul. He allegedly tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in pretrial detention, Anadolu said. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, a 7.7 magnitude quake shook the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another 7.6 magnitude quake at noon, causing more than 7,500 buildings to collapse in Turkey alone.
Hans Modrow, GDR's second-to-last prime minister, dies
The left-wing group in the German Bundestag has announced that the 95-year-old former SED official and later PDS and left-wing politician Hans Modrow has died. Dietmar Bartsch, chairman of the group, praised the former SED official and later PDS and left-wing politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
"Hans Modrow passed away last night at the age of 95," the Left faction in the Bundestag said on Saturday, saying the party was losing "an important personality," group chairman Dietmar Bartsch and former group leader Gregor Gysi said.
In the 1970s, Modrow became the 1st Secretary of the SED district leadership in Dresden. As Minister-President, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the Berlin Wall, on 13 November 1989, he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the People's Chamber elections on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow resigned a month later. He was succeeded as the last Minister-President of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
In a message on the short message service Twitter, Dietmar Bartsch, chairman of the Left Party, described Modrow as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist."
"Until his old age he was an important adviser in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
"The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was precisely one of his special merits, and that will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary.
"His later work in the Volkskammer, the Bundestag, the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS consisted always in representing that part of the former GDR population which was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After German reunification, Modrow served in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa), Modrow had a "very critical" view of the new state: German unification had been achieved too quickly, the GDR had collapsed too unconditionally, and it had been condemned too unilaterally as a "state of lawlessness".
What happened in the night
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemns Russian missile attacks, but Kiev must carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks has again forced emergency repairs to the Ukrainian power grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydropower plants have been damaged, the head of the energy utility Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. Particularly bad is the situation with the power supply in the Kharkiv region. Because of the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block at the Khmelnytskyi NPP had to be shut down, and production at the Rivne and Southern Ukraine nuclear power plants was curtailed.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Friday’s Russian attack with about 100 rockets and cruise missiles as terrorism, but in a video message he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Zelensky does not want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut
On February 24, it will be one year since the war began. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to Poland, a key supporter of Ukraine, shortly before the anniversary. The threat of Russian missile attacks continued on Saturday night. In the capital city of Kiev, an air alert was issued late Friday night for the fifth time on that day. "There is a threat of an attack with drones," the military administration of the Kiev region said. Fighter drones of Iranian construction were also sighted and shot down over the regions of Mykolaiv and Odessa in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultants for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, during the election campaign to split it up failed on the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, a compromise was reached on an infrastructure company, which, however, is to be oriented towards the common good in the future, which means that it does not need to generate and transfer profits.
Restructuring backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consultancy firms will help the federal government to accompany this process. The rehabilitation backlog in the rail network is one of the main reasons why trains are currently very late. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this problem by completely renovating entire rail corridors. The investments necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations by the railways, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone pinch me, please?"
After the race, Herrmann-Wick told us that she had slept badly, that she had been "totally upset" and that her pulse hadn't come down even when she started running. "It's impossible to describe a race like this in words," she said. 11,000 spectators were cheering to the roaring hit music with German flags, and the coaches and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoying biathlon", that's what she had in mind
The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope outside of the relay. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter. In the overall World Cup she currently occupies fifth place. And even if the density of performance among the women at the top is significantly higher than among the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, they had rather others on their list for this sprint victory.
Nicaragua: Bishop sentenced to 26 years in prison for criticizing government
The bishop is a prominent critic of the leftist leader. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been tense since 2018, when protesters calling for Ortega’s resignation took refuge in churches. More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often fearing repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Defence industry requests more orders from special funds
Initial defense projects have already been cancelled as a result, and other projects are threatened with the same fate, the "Welt am Sonntag" newspaper reports. However, it is not yet possible to say which specific investments would be cancelled. "There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this time," the German government said in an answer to a question from Ingo Gädechens (CDU), a member of the German Bundestag.
The reason for the decrease in the investment amount is the rising interest rates. The fully loan-financed special fund, which was approved by the Bundestag in June 2022, has to bear the interest burden for the loans itself. If these rise, less money is available for the specific acquisitions for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the current high inflation reduces the purchasing power of the remaining amount.
Copper cell: accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40 o'clock, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive to the left in the direction of Heilbronn on the motorway at the motorway exit Kupferzell. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver was driving the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, as the police reported.
Both accident victims stated that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic light system revealed no complaint. Further investigations follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be admitted to a hospital.
Stuttgarters pay tribute to the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgarters followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria.De sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
The earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria is preoccupying the world, and on Friday evening more than 200 people thought of the victims and prayed for them on Stuttgart’s Schlossplatz.
Many members of the community had responded to the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the imam's plea earnestly and silently. In the prayer, the imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could overcome this disaster. He asked, among other things, for health, protection from plagues and for respectful interaction with each other. The community also asked for assistance and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib is standing by the people of Turkey and Syria, the speakers said, expressing their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the commemoration. The pleas were also translated into German at the Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the victims of the earthquake in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great.The donation campaign of the German Islamic Association, the Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib), has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has been collecting donations in kind in Glockenstraße for several days, which will be delivered by truck to the earthquake areas.
Hiking with meat - Ebersberg
"After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps ".... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones simply put it into practice. Either way, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance in the years of the pandemic. Because whoever does not sit in the middle of a stone desert thanks to home-office, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, now uses the lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as a substitute for a walk in the fresh air.
One reason could, of course, also be that the modern man can combine the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things in the course of an optimal use of time slots. Because why not find out about the news from the settlement from the neighbor who has not been seen for a long time on the occasion of a short march through nature? Or meet the friend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Alte Kino?
Fresh fruit, for example, which stands alongside cheese on a table on the side of the road. Or potatoes and meat. It is only stupid if you have not thought about the purchase in advance and taken appropriate precautions. An elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden sales room of the farmer with empty hands and regret in their voice.
The disappointment can be felt, because you have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. Which you also let the sympathetic random acquaintance know. To which the man replies: "That's not true! You do have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which you quickly threw over before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional head covering unnecessary.
And so it happens that one starts the return journey with a meat inlay, and this lunchtime short excursion has not only enriched one with a lamb’s back, but also with a very practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be due on this day - after dinner, this time actually for digestion.
Pinched and seriously injured
Around 9 pm, the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the district road in the direction of Hailfingen and, for so far unexplained reasons, departed the road to the right in a left-hand turn, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a guide post, struck a tree on the side and stopped a few meters away. The driver was trapped in his car as a result of the collision. The fire brigade freed him with heavy equipment. The ambulance service brought the seriously injured man to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of driving incapacity, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, total damage to the Audi amounted to 1000 euros.
Donald Trump’s tax filings: a point for the rule of law
The U.S. Department of Justice has ruled that the Internal Revenue Service must hand over former President Donald Trump's tax returns to Congress.
Trump in 2018, still in office as President of the United States
The Treasury Department must instruct the IRS to hand over the confidential documents to the Finance and Taxation Committee, the ministry’s decision on Friday said.
Contrary to U.S. political custom, Trump had not made his tax returns public as a candidate or later as president, and he fought to the Supreme Court to stop the disclosure. A New York prosecutor's office has now received the documents, but details have not been allowed to be made public - unless it would lead to a trial.
The circle of people authorized to access the documents is slightly larger and, under certain conditions, individual details could be made public in the course of the committee’s investigation.In addition, confidential information continues to leak from Parliament.
"The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as president," Pelosi said in a tweet, adding that access to Trump's tax records is a matter of national security.

British gangster arrested in Thailand after long escape
LONDON (Reuters) - A 55-year-old British convicted drug dealer has been arrested in Thailand after five years on the run, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said on Saturday. The 55-year-old, who was on the NCA's Most Wanted list, was arrested by Thai police at a car repair shop in Bangkok on Friday.
The leader of a criminal group fled early in 2018 before the start of a trial in which he was sentenced in absentia to 11 years in prison for attempting to import amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros), authorities said.

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: the physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and who says he loves Viennese humour, breaks a spear for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits this. Whether this fits well in the generally prevailing domestic skepticism of science, it is a matter of opinion. His humour, however, fits very well in Vienna.
By the way, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert’s more recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold in New York as a stand-up comedian for a year in 2019. But now he is back and tells his German-speaking audience not only about his experiences overseas, but also explains what Wissensaft actually is and what it can do – and above all, what it can’t do.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people put off: What is really important? All this with a huge wink, unaffected and very ironic, and so we are not only well entertained, but can also learn something in the process.

1. General information
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X / Y-monitor. This game illustrates the battle from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley there are rock pyramids and rock squadrons, which provide the player with temporary protection, as they can not be destroyed by enemy bullets.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as agile missiles, which are increasingly difficult to hit during the extended game sequence. In addition, UFO's appear periodically. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different modes of operation. These are the Attraction Sequence, the Game Initiation Sequence, the Game Abl on, the Initial Input for High Scores and the Self-Test Sequence. The latter mode of operation represents a special sequence for the verification of the control elements and the computer function.
4. Game play
The game is triggered when the START button is pressed. The LED switch remains lit and the game sounds become audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slow moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles can be determined by the player by observing the text displayed in the upper left hand corner of his cockpit. A hint can say, for example: ENEMY FROM RIGHT. In addition, a point is visible on the wide-ranging radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound, which represents the enemy position.
The upper, conical area on the radar screen represents the player's field of vision on the screen below. If the enemy is in this area, it will be easy to aim at them on the screen, and the message "ENEMY IN FIRE AREA" will be displayed simultaneously in the upper-left handout display.
The flight position of the UFO's can not be detected by the radar. The UFO's are intended to round off the battle and distract the player, as they normally appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated by both the player tank and the enemy tank. A shootdown by the player brings this 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: For a slow moving tank 1,000 points, for a missile 2,000 points and for a super tank 3,000 points. A super tank drives and rotates twice as fast as the player tank.
5. Initial input for highest results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the high score table, HE or SHE may enter three (3) personal initials in the table after the game is over. The instructions are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Please note that triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, or a power outage will clear the high score table. Upon clearing (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores with their initials will be retained and re-entered on the screen to challenge other players. Any score above 100,000 will be additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player’s initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, the high score table will be deleted.
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE unit has five (5) new components. If you have experience with ATARI video devices, you should note these important differences. The new components are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI shift lever. It has been reinforced with several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing part, making this assembly more stable and ensuring proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, keeps the control lever in the center position. The micro switches are now fixed with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y game circuitry has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector Boards.
These new components, as well as all other major components of this unit, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new components is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol.
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should perform some checks to complete the quality control. To ensure that the device has been delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be performed: NOTE: The device has not yet been connected to the 220 V mains. A. Inspect the outside of the housing for damage. B. Open the service door of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all wiring harness connectors for proper and firm connections. Connect any open or loose connectors.
NOTE: Never force connector connections. The connectors are provided with a forced guide so that a correct connection is made.A 180 degree twisted connector connection will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the game PC board for proper and firm fit. (3) Note the serial number of the unit on the nameplate on the back of the unit. Check that the stamped serial number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector-Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, controller/audio II PC board and TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the serial number can be found on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided when calling your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other major components such as the power supply, the control console and the TV monitor for proper assembly. (5) Finally, the unit must be supplied with mains power and turned on.
DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a few tips that can help you resolve most problems with recent DirectX games.
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the package. The DirectX Diagnostic Tool can help you get an overview of your system if you are unsure if your PC meets the requirements. To run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool, follow these steps: Click the Start button and select Run. Type "dxdiag" in the text box. The DirectX Diagnostic Tool interface will appear. Here you can access all relevant system details, including graphics and sound card information. You can check whether graphics and sound are working properly, among other things, by clicking the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D, and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool.
It may happen that other programs take up the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs are obvious that they are running, and many are automatically started when the system starts. Such programs that are constantly running on your system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they may be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. Therefore, we recommend that you close such background applications before starting the game. - If you have antivirus or Crash Guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, find the program's icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable" "Close", or similar). - Once you have disabled the antivirus and Crash Guard programs, you should also disable the general
Before you install any software, it is important to make sure that your hard drive is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to “clean up” your PC on a regular basis. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: Use ScanDisk, Defragmenter, and Disk Cleanup to keep everything running smoothly. Chances are that your latest games will run mostly smoothly on your PC. A “clean” system also has the advantage of working much more efficiently, and thus other applications you use will run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to learn about the ScanDisk, Error Checker, Defragmenter, and Disk Cleanup tools. Using Windows Help
1. Click the “Start” button and select the “Help” (or “Help and Support”) option to access Windows Help. 2. Now click in the search box and enter the appropriate keyword, such as “ScanDisk” (Win 98/ME), “Error Checker” (Win 2000/XP), “Defragmenter” and “Disk Cleanup”, and you will get a guide that explains how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure that you have the latest drivers for your graphics card, as this can often prevent a game from crashing or freezing. - First, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the graphics card manufacturer.
How to Quit All Unnecessary Background Applications
Important note: After finishing the game, you should re-enable the background applications by restarting your PC, which will automatically re-enable any background applications you have closed. Windows 98/ME
1. Hold down the CTRL and ALT keys on your keyboard and then press DELETE. The “Close Application” window will appear, listing all background applications currently running on your system. 2. To terminate a background application, click the entry in the task list and then click the “End Task” button. Note: Do not terminate the background applications Explorer and Systray, as they are required for Windows to run. You can safely terminate all other background applications. 3. The window will now close and the task will be finished. Repeat the steps above to terminate all other background applications (except “Explorer” and “Systray”). Windows 2000/XP Professional
1. Hold down the CTRL and ALT keys on your keyboard and then press DELETE. The Windows Security window will appear. 2. Click “Task Manager” to open the Windows Task Manager. To end a background application, go to the “Applications” tab, click the appropriate entry in the task list, and then click the “End Task” button. Note: Depending on your system settings, pressing CTRL, ALT, and DELETE may not display the Windows Security window, but immediately display the Windows Task Manager. Windows XP Home
1. Hold down the CTRL and ALT keys on your keyboard and then press DELETE. This will display the Windows Task Manager. 2. To end a background application, go to the Applications tab, click the appropriate entry in the task list, and then click the End Task button.

INTRODUCTORY WORDS ON DRIVING
My desire to create video games was sparked by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a whole new world of possibilities and seemed to me to be a new means of expression that could push the world to its limits. It was a way for me to open up new horizons. I thought of myself as a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that everything was still to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that video games were only exploiting a tiny fraction of their amazing creative possibilities, because they were too focused on “action” and therefore a fundamental element of the human experience.

Game of Thrones
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game starts for one or (with minimum credit 2) for 2 players. You must try to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game is set so that a minimum prescribed area must be taken before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the timed SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. At alarm, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, while you are trying to draw your territory, your marker gets into the spiral of death, it will be destroyed, because you cannot cross your own path, or return. If you hesitate and do not fill your area
The QIX game is able to test itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls work properly.For more information, see "Service Program".The volume can be adjusted at the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

It is possible to install a coin counter in the device. One line to 412 V DC supply.One line to terminal J 15 - 13 on the ROM/IC board.
THE SERVICE PROGRAMME
For programming and testing, the 4 switches - located in the device - the self-test button and the LED's on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. This display allows you to select the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. With the help of the "Sub-Test" switch, the languages can be set. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" switch to switch to the next program display. Bet Programming. This display allows you to determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, it allows you to set a "maximum number of credits" that may be before the game starts. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch repeatedly, the factory or basic setting can be achieved if the underlying lettering is changed.
"Threshold": amount of the %-number that must be reached to switch to the next pass
"Time limit": release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Level of difficulty of the game
"Pull-up sound": at "0" no sound when stationary
with "1" sound even when standing (animated sound) "table model": with "0" standing unit
with "1" desktop unit
Credits per coin are set on the "Throw Slot Programming" display. High score program display (highest hit rate so far). The hit points and initials of the player are displayed, including the next 10 score numbers. The values are used to set the high score that was selected on the previous display (setting "back"). By pressing the "Up" button, the initials are set to QIX standard. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears. The "Total Evaluation" display. By pressing the "Up" button, it can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total Credit: The number of credits paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts from the beginning. The total credits are set to 1,000,000.
High Score: The number of times a player has scored high enough to knock out other players from the high score list. Pressing the "Up" button will set the values to 0, and pressing the "Test" button will bring up the next program display.
Coin slot programming/normal coin setting: This display allows the operator to select a standard coin setting or to program a different setting
If a default setting is provided, pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches selects the programming, while the upper digit is green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. If the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the default setting, the values can be adjusted by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After a single press, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that custom setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment effort by selecting a setting that is close to his desired values and changing only the values that are not suitable. Once the adjustment has been made, pressing the "Sub-Test" switch can be used to adjust the values.
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, where all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM will be reset to factory defaults.
Troubleshooting and Settings
Start the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED indicator). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can start. The tests and settings can be entered to the respective program display, pressing the "Test" switch will display the next program. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in the auto-test mode. In this program, the device will perform the hardware test continuously until it is switched off. When the "Open Coin Door to Test" display appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. If the plug J 19 is disconnected, the memory will be protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed.
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each Video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LED's. If the ROM checksum is incorrect, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be inserted as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoder plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732).
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking whether the storing was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the device with the above display stops, an error has been detected. If the Communications RAM's fail during the Video Board test, the error may have been caused by a faulty wiring (RAM) or fault in the Data Board. To locate the fault, remove the Data Board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: fault in U 3, U 4 or related circuits.
Graphics Board CMOS RAM
After values are written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the unit stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predetermined sequences of numbers in the color RAM. These numbers will be checked for correctness when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video-Board (Display RAM). The Display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each side. The results of these writings are compared to the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LED's indicate the faulty RAM. If a Display RAM fails, determine the problem and replace the RAM. If this fault diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LED's), it will indicate that the next check is started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star No. 1. The 2nd for the fact that the right jacket arrived without recognizable seam defects. BUT I was probably too excited about this jacket, because the disappointment was all the greater. I had oriented myself on the basis of the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it should sit so tight and I did not want to fight myself in an S or M with my bust size.... In the end, it would have fitted from the length and at the hip... in the rest I could swim.
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear it well from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally enthusiastic. She usually wears the 158 and the 36 fits her quite well in this case and will certainly be worn next year.
• Robust quality
I decided on the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately, I measured myself and the pad does not fit quite. But which is my fault. Then slightly changed something so that it fits. The pad seems very robust and you do not damage the edges anymore. You can use the nut or the whole surface.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself I quite okay, but not under one year. Because the area for chewing is much too large for the small mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months and he could not use it for the purpose of the size. Now with 12 months we have looked for it again and he can use it.
Quality not sufficient / Goes back unfortunately
I have let myself be dazzled by the partly exuberant reviews. I would like to send in advance that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. One very large (for storing the equipment) and one quite small for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has now become too small and I need a replacement. At Prime Day I acquired this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, I had read many of the reviews in advance.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far I had liked the Electrics series by E. L. Todd the best, but my opinion was revised with this book. The first two books I found very strong and also recommendable and had really looked forward to the third part. In the part is all the time about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily dragged into length. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally confesses everything and then is like a small child at every fight and turns away?! At the same time there were also discrepancies, my feeling, because at the end of the second part Volt still tried to convince Taylor's ex and did not believe him when he said that Taylor would be on him and tries to convince the ex that Taylor could not without him and he heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I had hoped that this is the last part of the series
Man destroys everything, knows nothing to appreciate and does not learn from it! First of all: Sooooo bad is the film now, as many write. Sure, of course the story is totally constructed, and again and again conceived according to the same scheme F. If you have seen the beginning, you know how the end is. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and knows nothing to appreciate, and does not learn from it! And that is exactly what the film wants to tell us! How many times have I just thought about the film ( and that although I know that it is just a movie, and the animals come from the computer) : Oh my God, the poor animals, there are often already the tears in your eyes. Therefore, Jurassic World Das gefallene Königreich is already really well done. It is only a pity that the man the message behind the film simply does not pick up, and that, although it is a mainstream film. Man destroys consistently, the animal and the environment and does not learn from it!
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film à la 8 Mile.This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be.This film is above all "French" - besides, he is calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with him and expect nothing from him, what he does not want to be.
Problematic
Taste like Quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that does not matter. 5 days every morning a package: nothing has moved, but nothing at all. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating as never before! Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Little helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation the diarrhea remains for 1 week. It is to be noted that in the smaller package size only 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late) were given, in the larger full 5?
I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint into a chocolate brown, in February / March I used this hair dye remover. I used the product twice. The first time I immediately noticed that it smelled terrible! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out about chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it, as in the instructions even if not satisfied result, another time. This time it was a waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked like the first attempt. What was the worst of all, it still smelled weeks after application.. No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just did not disappear.
Very highly recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a long time now and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time because of my work, lack of exercise and a longer additional illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only through healthy eating but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This works very well. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get better out of bed. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommended.
Funktion nicht ganz einwandfrei!!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I discovered the following gross defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The case has problems with the time to "connect" with the phone. This means that it is no longer charged although you have pressed the "Power On / Off" button for 3 seconds. If you remove the phone from the case and re-install it, you solve the problem in 70% of cases, but a new defect arises. 2) By frequently removing and re-installing the phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times.
Too expensive, too thin and disappointing
The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I promised myself much more of these cloths it is really very very thin. Since I used it I can unfortunately not exchange it anymore I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far exaggerated more than 2 euros you should not give.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower, when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a gift, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I shcon fell into the shower), gives bass as bass, Bluetooth works great... suction cup you have to water, of course, otherwise it loosens.. it can reproduce sound very loud... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loud, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the vocals already almost hurt in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are audible just good enough. My old speaker did not reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were represented in the volume quite naturally.
very poor
At a few places the paint was splintered and if you just walked over it with your hand, the paint also went to some places. We wanted to pick them up for free because we did not want to have them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. they would only exchange the damaged parts but as if both chest of drawers were damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon has done all this for us and transferred the money back to us. A LOB to Amazon
Better spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Supplied are individual parts which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which consists of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman has stuffed the product literally into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I did not complain, because I needed this product urgently. The supplied adhesive hardly holds, but sticks neatly - like chewing gum which does not harden. Already one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils fell off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least this was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that everything is not glued together. The stencils are partially incompletely punched. For one-time use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money
The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closure + nice look + stable when it is assembled + Shelf board can be positioned arbitrarily
- Doors pop through magnets (maybe you can compensate with rubber pads) - some dirty places
- supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (had no others and did not have them in the house, glued with craft glue) - the holders for the shelf wobble a little (wrapped it with some paper and balanced it) Conclusion: If it did not look so good and had so good dimensions, I would give fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied.Besides, I find it a little too expensive.
The coffee tastes me.... but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run through evenly (if at all!).
Goes on my alarm clock
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound horrible, and extremely loud. I could not turn them down. Probably a defect, allegedly this is possible. The quietest radio setting was too loud for me, I fall out of bed immediately. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned my face to the alarm clock, because I thought it was tomorrow. When it is time and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. The colors and the color change I found beautiful, unfortunately you can not dim the colored light. I also found it good that it has a battery, so that in a power failure the clock and the alarm time do not have to be entered again. But went back for the reasons mentioned.
Light super, workmanship insufficient
I replaced four bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board laughs at me at this point... There was nothing in the box either. "Pay 6 - get 4" is not a good deal. Certainly Amazon would have settled this courteously and quickly, but I only noticed this after the return period. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication for the quality of these bulbs - so far the only reason for two stars deduction. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit. The light color is more towards cold white. For hallway, study, workshop, laundry room etc. perfect. For living rooms, I would personally go for warmer light. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb.
Tolle
I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes positive. I have considered for a long time whether I order this set or not. ** The material is stable and it fits well in the hand. ** The utensils all have a hole on the handle to hang them ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use on pans with coating. ** They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. ** They do not pass on the heat and can therefore be handled directly. ** The dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But shortly after wiping and they are gone. Finally I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-goods sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping just top. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts geprüft.Hierbei we found that the part has already been installed. On all assembly parts we have to determine significant scratch, abrasions. The fittings / connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we have installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now we saw that also on the chromed faucet itself scratches / streaks can be seen. This part was probably already delivered and sent back again. We keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it does not matter how it looks.
Product itself top, outside sensor unfortunately broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and also the radio range is very good, there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer seems to be intact, here plausible values are still displayed. The hygrometer, however, is probably gone, because it is always displayed completely astronomical values of the outdoor humidity. That is a pity, because the device was installed outside in a protected place and also the reason why I give this product only two stars.
Strong mower with weak collector
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery today still drives cheerfully with Hermes through the republic without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service of Amazon with the triggering of a replacement delivery was as always excellent. The mower arrived quickly with me and made a valuable impression. The motor is strong and it results in a nice cutting image. The volume is not exactly impressively low, but ok. Big shortcoming is unfortunately the collecting basket. On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and of fabric in between. If you put it down full only briefly, then it is of course squeezed and parts of the content fall out. Worse, however, is that the actually practical level indicator already shows red at half full collecting basket. That would not be so bad if the mower would not lose large parts of the cut from there. Always emptying the basket with a large lawn area
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. Very good is the supplied pluggable sensor cable, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to conserve the battery only once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons I give only 4 stars. - The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment can only be closed again quite clumsily. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses the connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not connect again by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to take out the batteries and insert them again after a short break, then it connects again.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed properly. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high and the front right screw almost falls out, because it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the cart are straight as well as the table. Maybe someone knows what you can do there, because it is impossible to print something out.
robust and precise am positively surprised
My old caliper has unfortunately given up after many years, so a new one had to be made. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included, so you can get started right away. The packaging of the caliper is simple, but fully meets its purpose. Otherwise, the caliper leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full score for this and think it will last at least as long as the old caliper.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and did not wear it for the time being, because it exudes a disgusting smell. Until today, this smell has not gone away, although it was constantly "ventilated".
For the price ok
The stars and balls on this chain are a little too big for me personally, so that it looks quite massive. The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice. However, the chain is very easily processed, so that I have ripped the clasp twice already. So far I was able to repair it again and again, but I think that it will not go well / last long.
Very nice jewel
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't open, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it a little softer and more supple. Only: if you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, scrap! I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: Connects only after some tinkering.... if you stick to the instructions it does not work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and had inserted a new one, the transmitters were finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy did not last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, and that although the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three transmitters was very different!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft was rusted. I bought it again for one reason, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew that the connections of the suction line and the drain would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production defect and the current pump performs its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had a transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slots broken. The carton was damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled carton. I kept the pump anyway, because as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump performance.
You could have thought better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer is more comfortable than walking around with a huge keychain all the time. In the beginning, everything went quite well. However, the paint went off quite quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. Nice that this also works with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. I did not find a suitable slotted screwdriver that would not have ruined the whole screw immediately. To get to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: the attachment of the keys. It is nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths through the different parts, but if you have screwed the whole thing together, you need pliers to take the whole thing apart again. The attachment of the keys itself is just a game of patience, balance and skill.
Do not correspond exactly to the specified dimensions
Smooth zippers, the material seems robust and all in featherweight. Since I do not have a comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to judge the goods after the first use. I can already say that the height is lower than stated. At the moment I can not really imagine to pack everything there, for example, for a three-week holiday. If necessary, the really large parts can be placed directly in the suitcase - as before. It should be noted that not 8 but 10 parts were delivered, as two smaller bags / sachets were included in the round cosmetic bag. Not high-quality processed, I wanted to mention that anyway. That the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of different material than the other bags, does not bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that is ok.
So lala
So, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it did not work anymore. Battery? Changed. But it still does not work. So I could have thrown the money directly into the trash can.
Maintenance is always good! The application is easy, but you should be very careful with the brush to not damage the needle.I could not hear an improvement in the sound of my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. The battery runs for a very long time. Definitely perfectly adequate sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wearing and are therefore very comfortable. The earcups are totally soft and comfortable to wear.
a chic dress
Very nice dress, which is well wearable for various occasions.. price-performance is fully consistent here, especially since I also bought it in the flash sale. It fits perfectly in my size, I am glad that I did not order it smaller (was recommended). I would have only wished that the neckline was not so deep, and the sleeves could tolerate a little more fabric (if you do not have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture).
The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II Gaming Laptop. It is assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD is normally, Blu-rays are recognized as unreliable as possible. The discs must be inserted several times, then it makes Rödel noises as you have not heard since the 90s of old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes you can then either restart the computer because nothing will happen or the disc will finally be recognized. Then you must not press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the film or anything else. This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze.
Does what it is supposed to, but is not pretty. First of all, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually eye candy, because only the port that faces up is a USB port. The other plug is only for charging some devices there and thus relatively useless. I did not know this when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a mean extension, I would certainly not have bought this shapeless lump with golden plugs. But apart from the optics and my misjudgement, the extension fulfills its service very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the plugged USB stick does not just dangle around the area, like with a normal extension cord. So no real bad purchase, but my euphoria is kept within narrow limits :-).
Small but oho! I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and can connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also push data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters that I also had to send back could unfortunately not. Practical is the HDMI output. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is no problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. For what I still use my PlayStation: P There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This should bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case does not fit the adapter. Well, it also holds so securely and has contact from there...
Plenty of power
Top device. Runs for months without problems. Is not exactly light or quiet but brings decent performance. I find the middle position of the temperature (Tp setting) rather a little too cool and therefore am always on level 2. Has also fallen several times on the tiled floor and has survived it well.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a cheap impression.In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed.Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in the live mode is the location on felt 0.5m accurate. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, but he likes to jump once a few meters which is not disturbing. Would buy it again at any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently it lasts about 1.5h days through. Here would be a solution great which would create 7-14 days. There is a XL version but unfortunately this is too big for our taste, as long as the battery would not last with us and daily change we also find impractical.
After a few weeks garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the lifespan is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education, after a few weeks the sole breaks and the shoes can no longer be used. With the last pair, it was also in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought for classes it will be enough. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive rubbish and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I gladly ordered new ones. These are unfortunately poorly processed at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I owned before. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but at second glance, you can see that the edges are poorly processed and the retaining strap at the heel is quite loose and will probably not last five years like my previous ones.
Surprisingly good food
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very sceptical. However, since I am driving to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on good luck. The scope of delivery included the mattress and a car air pump. To the mattress: I laid it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that this does not appear again. In the inflated state, a lying test was performed directly. It can lie well on it and fits great for the festival. Of course, this mattress can not replace your own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury. The mattress fits perfectly into my car. Before we took out the seats in the back. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which also fit to the car.
Definitely not worth more than 10 €... Unfortunately, the calendar gets only two stars from me.:( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open by the clumsy processing directly on day 1 over several doors. On the 21st door there were no more doors and I had to more or less allow my son that he may take out the remaining parts accordingly as they almost fell towards him. The parts come out often in a mess which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to bring the parts. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off when playing. (Most of the windshield. This can also be installed very badly again.) In itself, I would not buy this calendar anymore and recommend it to anyone else. Maybe the manufacturers reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next edition.
a real drone
I am enthusiastic about the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies with it. It flies very well indoors and the 5-minute flight time is usually completely sufficient. That hair gets stuck in it and the drone breaks down very quickly, I did not expect anything else at the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem.
Game ok but only playable with force to Steam.Have not seen when buying that it is not a game CD but merely a code with which you can download the game.That would be okay so far, but you are forced to install Steam to play it at all, which is an outrage.Since then, the computer hangs constantly, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails at the runtime of the battery
I was looking forward to the clock. Design and optics great, messages etc. were displayed without problems. Operation worked well.... and yet I send them back. Drr big catch: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, only lying on drm cabinet overnight and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use. Came on the day many messages, the battery was already at noon / early afternoon at the end and then you can not even read the time.
Noble shell with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10 + you should definitely buy a case. I liked recently cases in which you can also insert the credit card. This offers the case here. If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it will be too much, then the lid is a little high. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well processed. It looks noble. The phone is embedded around in contrast to many other cases, only the connectors are recesses. Otherwise you can operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides well through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible on some QI chargers to charge the phone through the thickness of the case. Even on the QI charging station made of leather by TORRO it does not work. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can thus only be charged when the case is off.
high-quality case with armored glass film
Robust case with a real armored glass as a protection for the screen in a classic design offers an all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily pulled on. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not soil. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some support. It is not too bulky and is firmly on the phone. Overall a good purchase.
