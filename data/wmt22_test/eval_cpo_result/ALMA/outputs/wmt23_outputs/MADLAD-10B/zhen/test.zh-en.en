If you find a conflict between the manual page and the software, check the Info
If we notice that the contents of a man page are causing obvious confusion and complaints because they are outdated, we stop publishing it. There is no other option than to update the Info file at the same time as we update the man manual, because the other tasks of maintaining GNU cc do not leave us time to do that.

DESCRIPTION C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, Hii (compilation), (assembly) and MERE (linking).
The source file postfix identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the postfix controls the default setting:
gcc assumes that the preprocessed file (.i) is a c file, and sets up a c-like connection,
g++ assumes that the preprocessed file (.i) is a c++ file, and sets the connection in c++ form.
The source file suffix indicates the language type and the subsequent operations:
.c C source code; preprocessing, compilation, compilation
.C C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
. CXX C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i Preprocessed c files; compilation, compilation
.ii Preprocessed c++ files; compilation, assembly
.s compile language source code; compile
Compiled language source code; preprocessing, compilation
.h preprocessor files; files that do not normally appear on the command line with other postclass names are passed to the linker.
.0 Object file
.a Archive file
Connecting is always the last step unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process).
During the connection phase, all.e files, -1 library files, and unrecognized filenames (including specified.o H tags and.a library files) corresponding to the source program are passed to the OPTIONS connector in the order specified on the command line.
Options must be given separately: de'is completely different from `-d -r '.
Most `-=E:' and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Only formats that are not default options are listed here.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations placed in later sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Explicitly specify the language of the subsequent input file as language (rather than the default selection obtained from the subsequent filename).
This option applies to all subsequent input files, until the next `-x' option is encountered.
Turns off any explicit indication of language, so files are processed after the RE AS E `-x' option based on the filename).
If only part of the four stages (preprocess, compile, assemble, connect) are being operated, you can use the `-x' option (or Ah after the filename) to tell geo where to start, and the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' options to tell geo where to end. Note that certain combinations of options (e.g., `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source file, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC replaces source filenames with `.o' tag filenames.
Select the target file.
The compilation stops immediately, no assembly is performed.
Using pipelines instead of temporary files to work between different stages of the compilation process, because the assemblers of those systems could not read data from pipelines, the GNU assembler does not have this problem, and the assembler can accept the C "dialect": support for ANSI-compliant C programs.
This turns off some of the non-ANSI Cc-compatible feature keywords in GNU Cc, as well as ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax, which are welcome and rarely used, and turns off use-despite.
Function declarations without arguments, such as `int foo ();', are handled C-style --- i.e. without specifying the number or type of arguments. (C++ only).
Normally, such a function foo means in C++ that the arguments are empty.
The section list is removed from here to try to support some aspects of the traditional C compiler.
See the NU c manual for details, we have removed the details, so that when the content is outdated, people will not HERI.
Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option has an additional effect, allowing you to assign a value to this.
It is the same as the `-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp tries to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
In particular, the preprocessor mentioned above, but does not include the other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers Allows the use of `$' characters in identifiers (C++ only).
You can specify the `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to prohibit the use of `$' symbols.
(GNU C++ allows `$' by default on some target systems, but not all.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of ant to enumeration (MEF c++).
Normally, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not the other way around.
-fexternal-—templates produces smaller code (limited to c++) for template declarations by creating a copy of each template function only where they are defined.
To use this option successfully, you must tag all files that use the template with `#pragma implementatio' (definition) or `#Pragma interface' (declaration).
When a program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates ', the template instantiation is all external types. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved by using typedef, which references each instance as needed.
Correspondingly, if you compile with the default `-fno-exteznal-templates' option, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions (except constructor subfunctions and mnew or delete member operators) are treated as virtual functions of their class.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will pass through the internal table of virtual functions.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch Allows a mismatch in the type of the second and third arguments of a conditional expression.
The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable allows you to assign a value to this (for c++ only).
The incorporation of user-defined free storage management mechanisms into c++ makes the assignable `this' obsolete.
Therefore, by default, the operation to assign a value to this inside a class member function is invalid.
However, for backward compatibility, you can enable this with the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char defines char as a non-signed type, like unsigned char.
Each machine has its own default char type, which can be either an unsigned char or a signed char.
Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on the symbolism of data.
But many programs have been written using only simple char, and period streets that are signed (or unsigned, depending on the target machine for which the program is written).
This option, and its opposite option, causes such a program to work at the corresponding default value.
The type of a char should always be explicitly defined as either signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly the same as one of them.
If the `signed' or "unsigned" modifier is not explicitly declared, these options are used to define a bitfield or no bitfield.
By default, positional domains are signed, because they inherit a signed base integer type such as int, however, if the `-traditional' option is specified, positional domains are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in writable data blocks, and does not treat them in a special way.
This is for compatibility with some older programs where changing the string constant is a very bad idea, the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive Summary
The Impact of COVID-19 on the Drug Market
Its impact may be similar to the economic crisis of 2008
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed health-care services to the point of near collapse, and the restrictions imposed by Governments have severely disrupted the global economy.
The impact of the epidemic on the drug market is unclear and difficult to predict, but it could be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers who are unable to cross borders owing to travel restrictions may have to find new routes and methods.
Patterns of drug use and supply may change, and Governments &apos; ability to respond may be hampered.
The transformation brought by COVID-19 is unprecedented, but there are lessons to be learned from past crises.
Following the economic crisis of 2008, some drug users began to seek cheaper synthetic substances and shifted their patterns of use to injecting drugs.
At the same time, Governments cut drug-related budgets.
If Governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way, interventions such as the prevention of drug use and related risky behaviour, as well as drug treatment services, are likely to be severely affected.
In addition, priorities for interception and international cooperation may be lowered, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Drug trafficking is expected to be most directly affected in countries where large quantities of drugs are smuggled through commercial flights.
Couriers carry synthetic drugs, such as methamphetamine, in backpacks or hidden in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. With restrictions on air passenger transport imposed almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs is likely to be completely disrupted.
Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, the use of dark webs and mailed goods for trafficking is likely to increase.
In the longer term, economic recession and associated closures may disrupt drug markets.
Owing to rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug-related disorders and turn to illicit activities related to drugs, whether production or transportation.
Drug-trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable populations and to recruit new members to strengthen their ranks.
These shifts are likely to take root rapidly and become new realities in many communities, as governments &apos; ability to respond decreases.
Expansion and complexity
Market growth
The pattern of population growth partially explains the reasons for market expansion
Drug abuse has been on the rise throughout the world, both in overall numbers and as a proportion of the world &apos; s population.
An estimated 210 million people, or 4.8 per cent of the global population aged 15-64, used drugs in 2009, compared with an estimated 269 million people, or 5.3 per cent of that population, in 2018.
Over the past two decades, drug use has grown much faster in developing countries than in developed countries.
This reflects to some extent the difference in overall population growth over the period, 7 per cent in developed countries and 28 per cent in developing countries, but also reflects the faster growth of younger populations in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.
During the period 2000-2018, the population of this age group in developing countries will grow by 16 per cent, while in developed countries it will decline by 10 per cent.
1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets
In both developed and developing countries, drug abuse is more prevalent in urban than in rural areas.
The overall increase in drug abuse is partly attributable to large-scale population movements from rural to urban areas. More than half of the world &apos; s population now lives in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization is likely to be a key factor in future drug market dynamics, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.
Increases in wealth are associated with increases in drug use, but it is the poorest who bear the greatest burden of the disease. Worldwide, drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are strongly linked to the wealthier parts of the world.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug abuse is higher among the wealthier segments of society.
However, the rate of transition to drug-related disorders is higher among people of lower socio-economic status.
Data from a few countries suggest that there is a link between harmful drug use patterns and disease and low income.
These patterns appear to be less common in wealthier segments of society.
The economic constraints imposed by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labour market, such as rising unemployment, have historically been associated with increases in drug use, and the epidemic has already forced tens of millions of people worldwide out of work.
The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to more farmers growing or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because the control capacity of State authorities is reduced, or because more people may be forced to take the risk of engaging in illicit activities under the economic crisis.
COVID-19-related restrictions have led to a decline in air and land trafficking, which may have increased trafficking by sea, where the risk of interception is lower and the volume of smuggling is greater than by air or land.
Recently, there have been reports of shipments of cocaine being transported directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of substances not under international control is stable, but new opioids with potential harm are proliferating and drug markets are becoming increasingly complex.
Hundreds of synthetic drugs, many of which are not under international control, have been added to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine, and heroin. Non-medical use of drugs is also growing rapidly.
Approximately 500 new active substances are introduced into the domestic markets of Member States each year.
Currently, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small number of opioids.
While the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.
Of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, opioids accounted for only 2 per cent, but by 2018 that figure had risen to 9 per cent.
Many of the new opioid psychoactive substances are analogues of fentanyl, whose efficacy and harmfulness have been demonstrated, leading to overdose deaths in North America and, to a lesser extent, in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is used as a dopant in heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, and in the manufacture of counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
There is some evidence that the phenomenon of injecting stimulants containing new psychoactive substances is also occurring in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with exciting new psychoactive substances. &quot;
2 Use of new psychoactive substances may be becoming firmly entrenched in vulnerable populations
A single class of new psychoactive substances rarely forms a large market.
However, evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups, such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two States reported on the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, most of which identified synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.
Control of precursor chemicals has forced drug manufacturers to innovate. Many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and “ecstasy” have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and producers have been looking for alternatives, not only to less strictly controlled substances, but also to chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, known as “tailor-made precursors”.
Restrictive measures aimed at halting the spread of COVID-19 are likely to put further pressure on drug producers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has already become a reality: in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia was reported to have contributed to rising methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is fast-moving
Substitution of opiates by synthetic drugs in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiate market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The quantity of opiates intercepted by the authorities in the Russian Federation decreased by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use decreased significantly.
But the doping market seems to be booming.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various catecholamines, including mephedrone and a-pyrroloquinoline quinone, are now widely available on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities reported a sharp increase in the number of recently discovered clandestine laboratories manufacturing various illicit drugs, more than doubling in two years to 152 in 2018.
Growth of methamphetamine markets in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, surveys of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystallized methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, alongside fentanyl and tramadol.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with users reporting that cannabis was harder to obtain than “fentanyl” or methamphetamine.
Recently, the Iraqi authorities discovered several methamphetamine laboratories, and the Board has expressed concern about the import of large quantities of pseudoephedrine preparations used as precursors in one methamphetamine laboratory.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacture appears to have begun in 2014.
Seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing since then.
But seizures in the first half of 2019 amounted to 657 kilograms – a sharp increase from the previous year.
Significant seizures of methamphetamine believed to originate in Afghanistan in other countries also indicate that production in that country is rising rapidly.
Policy changes and trends
Most jurisdictions that have legalized cannabis for non-medical use have seen an increase in cannabis use
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although similar trends have been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized the non-medical use of cannabis.
In Colorado and Washington, the first two states in the United States to pass legislation, the non-medical use of cannabis by adults has increased, particularly in the past month and for daily or almost daily use, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show an increase in cannabis use in Uruguay since 2011, with use almost doubling in the past month.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the frequent and frequent use of cannabis.
Short-term data from Canada also suggest that the expansion of the legal market between 2018 and 2019 was accompanied by an increase in use.
However, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illicit sources in 2019.
Is cannabis legalization behind the sharp decline in global cannabis herb seizures?
In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, owing to a decline in seizures in North America, which fell by 84 per cent over the past 10 years.
In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effectThe effectiveness of national regulation of new psychoactive substances remains difficult to assess.
A number of countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of use of new psychoactive substances.
In other States, the use of new psychoactive substances decreased following the adoption of national legislation.
The availability of pharmaceutical opioids for pain management and palliative treatment, mainly in high-income countries, is unevenly distributed across regions.
In 2018, more than 90 per cent of all pharmaceutical opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50 per cent are in North America, 40 per cent in Europe and 2 per cent in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12 per cent of the world &apos; s population.
It is estimated that while low- and middle-income countries account for 88 per cent of the global population, they consume less than 10 per cent of pharmaceutical opioids.
Barriers to access to pharmaceutical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescription practices.
Poverty increases the risk of drug use disordersAn estimated 35.6 million people had a drug use disorder in 2018.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug-related disorders and exacerbate their consequences. This is confirmed by studies in high-income countries, in which individuals’ unfavourable socioeconomic trajectories are linked to the risk of drug-related disorders, rather than simply their status at a given point in time.
Drug use disorders also exacerbate socio-economic disadvantage, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby fuelling a vicious circle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, groups of diverse sexual orientation, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug-related disorders or face problems in accessing treatment services.
According to the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death, the broader social impact of harmful drug use has increased over the past 10 years.
Between 2007 and 2018, the number of global disability-adjusted life years attributed to drug use increased by 17 per cent.
The increase in disability-adjusted life years associated with liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, is particularly high -- up to 40 per cent.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to establish all the causal links between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited global data suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
But alcohol appears to play a greater role than drugs in violent incidents.
While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases the link can be partly attributed to a variety of mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity resulting from personal risks, family environment and peer influence.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
Large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, are likely to be carried out without violence where stable criminal structures exist.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depend less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of illicit markets, the death or imprisonment of prominent offenders and law enforcement measures that weaken one group over another.
Latest trends
Cannabis is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most harmful
An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug globally.
In comparison, opioids were used by 58 million people in 2018.
However, the harm associated with opioids is overlooked because of the small number of users.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66% were attributed to these substances, and 50% of the 21 million life years believed to be lost to disability or premature death due to drug use.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis
In West, Central, and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by tramadol; in North America, it is exacerbated by fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of their economies, demographics, or general drug-use patterns, but they are both struggling with opioid crises fueled by substances that are readily available and cheap to produce.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has contributed to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, fentanyl accounted for two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths recorded in the United States.
Canada reported similar results, albeit in lower numbers.
Fentanyl overdose deaths are partly due to the unpredictable effects of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.
In West, Central and North Africa, the market for tramadol for non-medical use has grown significantly.
An increasing number of patients with tramadol-related disorders are receiving treatment in the region.
In 2017, the amount of tramadol intercepted globally increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.
But in 2018, after India passed a new law to regulate tramadol, global seizures dropped to 32 tons.
Simple manufacture and low production costs, in addition to the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors, contributed to the crisis in both places.
The crisis in both places is exacerbated by the fact that these substances are available on both the pharmaceutical and the illicit markets, making their abuse more difficult to detect and prevent.
Increasing use of stimulants
The area of stimulants is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are on the rise in their main markets.
An estimated 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, owing to its popularity in North America and Western Europe.
An estimated 27 million people used amphetamine in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most widely used amphetamine-type stimulant in South-East Asia and North America.
According to most available indicators, methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions over the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine coexist and sometimes substitute for each other, so that the use of one drug increases when the use of the other decreases, and sometimes both increase and decrease simultaneously to meet demand in the same market.
COVID-19 raises risks for injecting drug users
It is estimated that approximately 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018, accounting for about 10% of global HIV infections.
More than 1 million injecting drug users are infected with HIV and 5.5 million with hepatitis C.
In 2017, approximately 585,000 people died from drug use, half of them from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, which remains largely untreated among injecting drug users.
Shortages of opioids caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute them with more readily available substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
More harmful use patterns are likely to emerge as some users switch to injecting or inject more frequently.

EU summit for refugee policy debate, EU officials: the reception process step by step bottleneck-China News Network
EU summit fights over refugee policy, EU officials say bottlenecks at every step of the reception process
At the latest summit of the European Union, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed on a stricter policy on illegal immigration, making it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
The EU’s move is reportedly a response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, where the core problem today is that very few illegal immigrants are eventually returned.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to “immediately mobilize substantial EU funds” to strengthen external borders, including with infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU has been quarrelling with member states over issues such as the payment of fence costs.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not cover the costs.
But some member states’ diplomatic officials say that if the EU were to share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along its external borders, it would free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.
According to Euractiv, EU officials have acknowledged that the EU’s refugee reception system is in an almost “permanent crisis,” with bottlenecks at every step of the process, limited reception capacity, and overburdened immigration authorities in member states unable to prevent refugees from filing “innumerable” asylum applications across the EU.
According to the European Commission, the EU’s Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, almost half as many as the year before.
Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
In this context, the summit also agreed on a “principle” that EU countries can repatriate illegal immigrants on the basis of a court ruling in another member state.
In addition, EU leaders agreed to “increase the use of the safe country concept,” which would pave the way for the EU to develop a common list, the report said.

U.S. upgrade "chip war" hit global semiconductor industry-CNN
Recently, the U.S. “chip war” against China has escalated – first, the Netherlands and Japan, under U.S. pressure, agreed to initiate controls on exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; then there are foreign media reports that the U.S. government is considering cutting all links between U.S. suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting U.S. suppliers from supplying any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order limiting U.S. investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries … Soon after the beginning of 2023, the U.S. will continue to harass the development of Chinese semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the U.S. has never stopped fighting China's "core" development, while precisely cracking down on China's semiconductor supply chain, while building a "de-Chinese" semiconductor industry chain alliance, attempting to completely "get rid of" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is through a “technology alliance” with South Korea, a “quadrilateral chip alliance” with South Korea, Japan, and China’s Taiwan region, or a “small circle” of semiconductor industry chains through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia “Quadrilateral Mechanism” and the “Indo-Pacific Economic Framework,” the US is attempting to build a US-led closed supply chain cycle by introducing politicization, bifurcation, and weaponization into the semiconductor industry, thereby compensating for its shortcomings in chip manufacturing and maintaining its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, the US’s much-vaunted “core tactics” against China are also “one-in-a-thousand to one-out-of-eight-hundred.”
Recently, the prominent U.S. chip-making equipment supplier Broadcom announced that it would lay off 1,300 full-time employees and 1,400 temporary employees over the next two quarters as a result of the latest round of chip-making equipment export bans against China.
Global optoelectronic giant Ascom Holdings, Inc., recently warned that a ban on exports of semiconductor-making equipment to China could drive up semiconductor prices.
U.S. media reports that many U.S. companies, including electronics design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves, have suffered greatly after the U.S. government imposed arbitrary pressure on Chinese industries such as chips and semiconductors.
The US’s so-called crackdown on China’s advanced semiconductor industry has dragged down the global semiconductor industry and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, with a well-connected global semiconductor industry chain.
According to professional estimates, based on specialized division of labour, the entire production process of a semiconductor product requires more than 70 crossings of national borders, taking up to 100 days.
While the United States semiconductor industry has a strong base, it is weak in terms of manufacturing capabilities, particularly advanced process technologies, and is heavily dependent on East Asia.
The regional distribution and interdependence of global semiconductor-related industries is unlikely to change, even if the US tries to steer advanced chip supply chains towards US-led “small-circle” regionalization.
The U.S. strongly “reshaped” the “de-Chinese” semiconductor industry chain, devastating the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are at the core of the global industry of the future, and the development of the chip industry requires the participation of all countries of the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introducing the Innovation and Competition Act, the 2022 U.S. Competition Act, and the Chip and Science Act, exploiting its technological hegemony to consolidate its technological leadership advantages. It has also “encouraged” its allies, such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung, to set up factories in the United States, striving to ensure the global leadership of the United States in the field of chips.
In the short term, the US does reap real benefits by creating trouble for China’s chip and related industries.
But in the long run, US hysterical pressure, pushing the Chinese chip industry to continue to breakthrough, allowing itself to lose a huge Chinese market, will ultimately greatly weaken the willingness and ability of US technology companies to innovate, and harm the development of the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension products on sale at least can only hold 360 days-CNN
First sale of personal retirement savings products
Minimum holding period is 360 days.
Personal retirement savings products are finally online.
On February 10, China Finance Network released the first list of personal retirement savings products, seven personal retirement savings products of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural and Rural Bank of China and China Postal Bank of China were officially sold.
At this point, the “shelves” of personal pension accounts finally contain four categories of products: personal pension savings, personal pension investment, personal pension insurance, and personal pension mutual funds.
It was explained that the first batch of personal retirement savings products were all publicly traded net-value open-ended products, of which 5 were new products, 2 were existing products, and the remaining 6 were fixed-income products, with the exception of 1 hybrid product.
Beijing Youth newspaper reporters saw that four of the five newly issued products come from Bank of China, all fixed-income products, the minimum holding period is 365 days, 540 days, 720 days and 1080 days, respectively, the corresponding performance benchmark (annualized) is 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, 5.25% - 5.75%.
The remaining newly issued product is the "Postal Bank of China Wealth Yi Yi Hong Jing Minimum Hold 1095 Days No. 1", which is also a fixed-income product, which began on February 10 and ended on February 19, with a risk rating of 2.
Of the two existing products, one is a 360-day technology-innovative renminbi investment product, which is a hybrid investment product with a risk rating of level 3.
The other continuing product is the fixed-income type "Postal Bank of China Wealth Yi Yun Hong Jing Minimum Hold 365 Days No. 1", which was launched on December 30 last year and officially launched on January 4 this year, with a cumulative net value of 1.0011 on February 8.
According to the Opinion of the Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Personal Pensions, the financial products in which funds in personal pension fund accounts may be invested include bank savings accounts, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and publicly traded funds.
The launch of the first individual pension investment products marks the official launch of investment products for individual pension investors through personal pension fund accounts.
Last November, the Banking and Insurance Supervisory Commission issued the Provisional Procedures for the Management of Personal Pension Businesses of Commercial Banks and Financial Institutions.
The Scheme provides that participants may purchase personal pension products, such as personal pension savings, personal pension investment products, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension mutual fund products, through personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Welfare, the Ministry of Finance and the National Tax Administration issued a circular stating that the personal old-age pension system would be implemented in Beijing, Tianjin and 36 pilot cities and regions, including Shijiazhuang, Xuan An New District, Hebei, and Jin City, Shanxi.
By the end of 2022, there will be 19.54 million individual pension participants, 6.13 million contributors and a total contribution of 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks participating in the pilot only offered three types of products: personal retirement savings, personal retirement insurance products, and personal retirement mutual funds.
Now that personal-pension-saving products are also available, how should investors choose?
Experts from the Research and Development Department of the Central Bank of China said that, compared to other personal pension products, the pilot phase of the retirement savings product and the personal retirement savings product have three characteristics.
One is robustness, with more robust risk management mechanisms, more robust investment strategies and philosophy, and independent custody by a third party other than the parent bank.
The second is the long-term nature. The term of the retirement savings products in the pilot phase is five years or more. The minimum holding period of the individual retirement savings products to be issued in the next phase is in principle one year, and holding for more than three years is encouraged.
The third is universality. The threshold for purchasing products is low, generally starting at 1 yuan, and in some cases as low as 0.01 yuan.
Professionals point out that investors make choices based on product characteristics and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have a longer term, higher interest rate and high security characteristics, and are suitable for those with low risk-bearing capacity; personal pension insurance products emphasize security, and are more suitable for those who are unable to bear investment risks and can accept stable returns; while personal pension savings products and publicly traded funds products do not guarantee capital or returns, have certain investment risks, but expected higher returns, and are suitable for those with certain financial knowledge and higher risk-bearing capacity.

Fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of confidence-China News Network
Another Big Gym “Thunderstorm”?
Recently, the issue of defending the rights of fitness members in well-known fitness institutions has attracted the attention of society.
After the Spring Festival, many members discovered that their shops were not operating normally, and rumors about the closure of the institute caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of the public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the head of the institution responded, promising to work hard to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the storm subsided.
Some stores of individual fitness institutions have operational problems, temporarily closed, consumers could calm down and wait for the problem to be solved, why many members of the first reaction is "things are not good"?
Behind the storm of claims by fitness club members is a deep-seated crisis of confidence in the industry.
Traditional gyms in China are generally pre-paid, and the underlying logic behind their development is to “make money without users.”
Cash flow generated through pre-sales of membership cards and the opening of new stores appears to be cyclical, but in reality it is unpredictable and does not form a stable profit model.
Negative reports from industries such as gyms and jogging tracks have been rife, causing a severe blow to consumer confidence.
From a market perspective, gyms are, of course, a good business that “pays off.”
The fitness track, though ups and downs, has always attracted capital.
A number of figures show that the market is continuously recovering, with a rising interest in cultural consumption and other areas.
Specifically to the fitness market, as the standard of living of the population steadily improves, the concept of healthy living deeply in the heart of people, fitness industry development has much to be done.
The more the situation improves, the more the industry needs to focus on the quality of development.
However, individual institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption, just emerged from the crisis, blowing the horns of the frontier, the financing funds invested in the construction of new stores.
It is undeniable that in the past few years, affected by the pandemic, many institutions have withdrawn, the industry has been revamped, and strong companies have selectively increased acquisitions and repositioning at this time, taking advantage of new opportunities.
However, if the fitness market is to enter a virtuous circle and move on to a stable and far-reaching road, the industry will have to change the traditional model and change the business strategy.
Only by steadily rebuilding consumer confidence and security can we truly win the market and win the future.
Instead of building new stores to capture the market, the fitness industry now more need to focus on optimizing services, high-quality development to stabilize users.
First, services are needed to retain users.
The gym belongs to the service industry, the essence is to adhere to the "user orientation", closely around the user's needs, the focus of the operation on the upgrading of service quality.
Second, digital transformation will enhance the user experience.
One example is the popular Internet gym model, which allows users to pay per session and choose their own location.
At the same time, physical data and movement data can be used effectively, and can also meet social needs, achieving a complete service closed loop from online to offline.
With no one-on-one marketing, and no high-priced memberships, users are less concerned about “running out” and more confident.
In addition, diversified industries should be actively explored.
Today, sports consumption has moved from single services to scenario consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become new entry points for consumption. Peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment needed for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with richer choices.

Nanjing housing market reappears "differential compensation"-China News Service
Yanzi Evening News (Reporter Ma Zhou) Yanzi Evening News / Zibo News reporters 10 in an interview found that more than a decade unseen "guaranteed price agreement" returned to the Nanjing housing market, located in the new district of Jiangbei a property claims "difference compensation", before the delivery of the house of other housing sources greater than the previous discount, the developer is willing to exchange the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
"Price Guarantee Agreement" conditions can be quite a lot
Mr. Sun, a tenant at the building in Jiangbei New District, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he visited the building last weekend.
The photographs he sent to the journalists show that the developer of the building promised that for purchases made between 1 February and 28 February, from the date of signing the purchase and sale contract between the parties until the delivery of the corresponding house, if the preferential discount for other houses in the project is greater than the discount for the previous purchase (limited to other unsold houses belonging to the same size, same building, same unit, same property type), the developer can exchange the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
According to Mr. Sun, the real estate consultant said that it was actually a "price guarantee agreement", the purpose of which is to give the buyer confidence in buying, not to worry about the developer's discount promotion, "now you're afraid that after buying it, the price will be reduced, go to the sales office, there is no time, and if you don't, it's really safe."
Others argue that the price-guarantee agreements, while giving homebuyers a “tablet of hope,” are not bad at all.
Ms. Zheng, who intends to buy a short-term home in Jiangbei, says that guaranteed-price homes must first be of the same size, in the same building, and in the same unit. There are few homes that buyers can compare, so the “threshold” is still quite high.
Others argue that, because of the asymmetry of information, it is difficult for buyers to “enforce” their rights, given that additional concessions are not excluded at the time of sale.
The ability to retain home buyers remains to be seen
Reporters in Nanjing online real estate inquiry learned that the building in November last year, the chief of two buildings with a total of 252 suites source of the sale, the size of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc., fully furnished licensed average price is 39,843 yuan / sqm.
However, more than two months later, online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the project is 157, or 62.3%, of which 128 units in building 8, or 113 units, are unsold, and 44 units in building 7, or 124 units, are unsold, and the total number of sold units in the project is only 33, or 13%.
According to market observers, “price-guarantee agreements” also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, in order to attract buyers, Yongkang Xiyuan, a building on Huangshan Road in Hebei, launched a price guarantee program, with the specific content of "the company's solemn commitment, if the project's preferential margin is expanded within a year, the resulting difference, the company will refund the difference to the old owner".
Later, in April 2011, nine owners of housing in Nanjing also promised to "pay the difference".
“As the housing market warms up, the need for a ‘heart tonic’ is even greater.
Mr. Shen, a senior trader in the Nanjing real estate industry, said that "price guarantee agreements" are also one of the marketing methods of real estate companies.
He argues that developers now need confidence more than buyers, and that the introduction of “guaranteed-price agreements” is actually encouraging them.
Regarding the retention of homebuyers, he said it depended on the impact of multiple factors, such as regulatory policies, lending thresholds, etc., and remained to be seen at this time.
Taiwan's economic performance in the first half of 2017 was weaker than expected-CNN
TAIPEI, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Exports fell for the fifth month in a row, the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) contracted for the seventh month in a row, and the consumer price index (CPI) fell for the third month in a row.
Experts believe that Taiwan's economy has not performed well in the beginning of the year, and growth pressure is not small.
According to Taiwan &apos; s Ministry of Finance, exports from Taiwan amounted to $31.51 billion in January, down 21.2 per cent year-on-year, the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
Exports in all 11 major export categories fell compared with the same period last year.
Plastic rubber and products thereof and optical equipment fell the most, by 37.6 per cent and 35.7 per cent, respectively.
Exports of electronic components fell by 20.1 per cent, the largest decline in 11 years.
Of these, integrated circuits fell by 18.3% year-on-year, the biggest decline in 14 years.
According to the head of the department's statistics department, Tsai Minna, this indicates that the effects of weak demand in the consumer electronics industry are spreading, and the electronics industry is entering a correction period.
Statistics show that in January, Taiwan &apos; s imports and exports fell, with a surplus of only $2.34 billion, the lowest in three years.
In the opinion of the authorities responsible for fiscal affairs in Taiwan, the decline in global end-user demand, the adjustment of inventories in the industry and the reduction in the willingness of manufacturers to purchase raw materials make it unlikely that exports will improve in the short term, and the decline in Taiwan &apos; s exports in the first quarter of this year is likely to be greater than expected.
According to the Taiwan China Economic Research Institute, the Taiwan manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) seasonally adjusted to 40.4% in January, down 3.3 percentage points from last December, the seventh consecutive month of contraction.
In the system of economic monitoring indicators, the PMI takes 50% as the golden mean, with an index greater than 50% representing expansion and the opposite of contraction.
Among the five component indicators of Taiwan's PMI in January, new orders, production and labor employment contracted, suppliers' delivery times decreased, and inventories contracted.
The six major industries all returned PMI contraction, the industries in order of contraction rate are power and mechanical equipment industry (35.1%), electronics and optics industry (35.2%), chemical and biotechnology medical industry (39.2%), basic raw materials industry (42.4%), transportation industry (42.6%) and food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the Central Bureau of Statistics announced that Taiwan’s CPI rose by 3.04% in January, the highest rate since July last year.
Of these, vegetable prices rose by 28.25 per cent, reaching a 17-month high.
According to Cao Zhihong, a member of the Bureau of Statistics, the increase in vegetable prices has indeed exceeded expectations. Excluding the Chinese New Year, the average CPI in January and February should be close to the 2.71% of last December. Inflation pressure still exists and remains high.
Looking ahead to this year’s Taiwan economy, experts expressed pessimism based on reports in the mainland media such as the Associated Press and Yahoo Finance.
The decline in exports could lead to cash-flow problems for exporting manufacturers, raising the risk of debt default, according to Wu Dai-Lin, a professor of economics at Central University in Taiwan.
At the same time, the decline in orders led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household finances, which in turn impacted consumption capacity.
Taiwan Economic Research Institute researcher Qu Dasheng believes that this year's inflation situation in Europe and the United States has not been resolved, demand continues to shrink, and Taiwan's export recession is expected to continue in the first half of the year.
As Taiwan &apos; s economy is supported by exports and is affected by the slump in exports, the full-year economic growth performance will be lower than last year.

China News Service
China News Network, February 11, 2018 Title: China's e-commerce industry is emerging "new variables", how to make the delivery "content is king"?
China News and Finance correspondent Shaping
“We entered the e-commerce arena late, but we knew from the start that content was important if we wanted to stand out from the millions of stores out there.
Fan Fan, a 90-year-old woman from Guangdong, now runs a nutritious food store on Twitch e-commerce, allowing an offline store with a history of more than 30 years to "flower" online.
Imitating the old Hong Kong film soundtrack, with classic Cantonese songs, open @ Fan Fan one-man-eating Twitch account, the beautiful video is refreshing to the ears.
At the recently held Twitch e-commerce "finding peers, quality content sharing special session," Fan Fan spoke as a representative of quality creators, and introduced the experience and experience of daily creation.
She said on the spot: "The carefully polished video garnered a lot of attention from netizens, many people are interested in my family's food ingredients, want to make food together, and the sales road suddenly opened.
‘
Fan Fan used her cooking videos to make more people fall in love with "the taste of Old Guang", selling up to 300,000 nutritious food items in one live broadcast, saving her family's old shop from closing down.
"No content, no e-commerce", with the development of short video and live e-commerce, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content is entering a new phase.
In the early days of take-away, booths often attracted customers with low-price discounts, and price advantage seemed to be the only selling point.
In recent years, there have been phenomenal Vs such as Liu Zahong and Oriental Selection, as well as a number of unknown experts and businesses in the vertical segmentation field, who have improved long-term operating efficiency by continuously creating high-quality content that matches their brand tone.
Gao Xiaoxuan, head of e-commerce star author operations at Twitch, said that 6.27 million creators have monetized content through Twitch e-commerce in the past year, their content creation volume has grown by 252%, and the total sales amount has more than doubled.
“Behind these figures, we can sense a thriving and vibrant author ecosystem.
"Yes," he said.
The Beijing Normal University Communication Innovation and Future Media Experiment Platform previously released the E-commerce Industry Content Ecological Health Index (ECHI) report, analyzing the importance of quality content as a "new variable" in the current e-commerce industry from a data perspective, and using the index to assess the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China.

Good PGC (professionally produced content) and UGC (user-generated content) are the quality vehicles for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the scenarios of consumption and promotion, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, the greater the commercial value, and the higher the proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption gradually integrated between the public and private spheres.

He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from the "consumer accessibility" to the "consumer quality" stage, and high-quality, professional, differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and handle of the new phase of e-commerce development, and PGC content such as knowledge payment, professional knowledge, and KOL (Key Opinion Leader) has begun to become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking ahead to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming made two recommendations.
One is to promote the overall improvement of the ecological health and quality of e-commerce content from the point of view of content structure improvement, to create positive content creation and management standards, and to achieve e-commerce industry content ecological health system index and dynamic balance.
The other is from the external ecology point of view, to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the external environment value synergy and co-creation.
"The future e-commerce industry also needs more data and artificial intelligence support, forming a forecast for future development stability; In addition, to provide businesses with more standardized, healthy growth space, achieve value synergies of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and jointly create a healthy content ecosystem.

Xi Jinping's Important Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the Seminar on the Study and Implementation of the Spirit of the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of China
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11, 2017 Title: Advancing Chinese-Style Modernization is a Systemic Project: Four Thoughts on Profoundly Understanding Secretary General Xi Jinping's Important Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the Seminar on Studying and Implementing the Spirit of the Twentieth Party Congress
Xinhua News Agency
“Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a system project that requires balanced consideration, systematic planning, and comprehensive advancement. It requires proper handling of a series of important relationships, including top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, integrity and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and self-strengthening, and openness to the outside world.
At the opening ceremony of the seminar for new members of the Central Committee, alternate members of the Central Committee, and key leadership cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels to study the implementation of Xi Jinping's socialist ideas with a Chinese characteristic for a new era and the 20 principles of the Party, Secretary General Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization construction, systematically and thoroughly clarified a series of important relationships that need to be handled well in practice, and provided a scientific methodology for us to vigorously advance Chinese-style modernization.
The promotion of Chinese-style modernization involves all areas of the economy, politics, culture, society, ecology and civilization, as well as all aspects of Party and State governance, military governance, domestic affairs, foreign affairs and national defence.
Top-level design requires a profound understanding of the world &apos; s development trends, an accurate grasp of the common aspirations of the masses of people, and an in-depth exploration of the patterns of economic and social development, so that the system of plans and policies developed reflects modernity, grasps the patterns and is rich in creativity.
Advancing Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory endeavour. There are still many unknown areas that need to be boldly explored in practice, and reform and innovation must be used to advance the cause.
The strategic question is the fundamental question of a political party and a country.
In advancing the Chinese-style modernization, we must strengthen the forward-looking nature of the strategy, foreseeing and leading the future with a scientific strategy. We must strengthen the comprehensive nature of the strategy, focusing on solving the major problems that affect the rise and fall of the Party and the nation's cause, and moving the whole thing at once. We must strengthen the stability of the strategy, and once the strategy is formed, it must be adhered to for a long time, caught up to the end, and done well.
We must scientifically grasp the dialectical and unified relationship between strategy and tactics, combine the principled nature of strategies with the flexibility of tactics in an organic manner, be flexible and agile, adapt to random changes and make ad hoc decisions, and grasp strategic initiatives while adapting to the local circumstances, responding to circumstances and following the tide.
The Chinese nation is a nation of integrity and innovation.
In dealing with the relationship between integrity and innovation, we must preserve the essence, source, roots and soul of Chinese-style modernization, unwaveringly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, and ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization. At the same time, we must place innovation at the forefront of national development, respond to the development requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively recognize change and seek change, vigorously promote reform and innovation, continuously shape new development dynamics and advantages, and fully stimulate the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important foundation for equity, and equity is a strong guarantee of efficiency.
In advancing Chinese-style modernization, we must not only create greater efficiency than capitalism, but also preserve social equity more effectively, so that efficiency and equity can be better balanced, promoted and integrated.
The relationship between efficiency and equity must be properly addressed, and development must continue to be for the people, depend on the people, and be shared by the people, so that the results of modernization and construction benefit all the people more widely and more equitably.
To advance Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to deal with the relationship between dynamism and order, so that society can be both dynamic and orderly.
The two major issues of development and security must be well integrated, the overall national security concept must be implemented, the national security system must be improved, the capacity for safeguarding national security must be enhanced, and the security of the national regime, the security of the system, the security of ideology and the security of priority areas must be firmly safeguarded.
China is taking greater account of security considerations in its development, improving national security through development and using development gains to strengthen the foundations of national security. It is also skilled in creating a security environment conducive to economic and social development, continuously stimulating the dynamism of development and achieving the beneficial interaction of high-quality development and high-level security.
In advancing Chinese-style modernization, we must not only stick to our own path, but also broaden our outlook on the world, maintain openness to the outside world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of Chinese-style modernization.
We must adhere to the principles of independence, sovereignty, self-reliance and self-strengthening. We must adhere to the principle of placing national and ethnic development on the basis of our own strength. We must adhere to the principle of keeping the destiny of our country &apos; s development and progress firmly in our own hands.
China must continue to expand its high-level openness to the outside world, deeply participate in global industrial division and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, expand the development space for China-style modernization, share development opportunities for mutual benefit and win-win, and jointly create a better future.
Follow the path and you will go far.
Let us, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and under the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping &apos; s socialist ideology with Chinese characteristics for a new era, grasp the laws, persevere, fully exercise our energy, initiative and creativity, correctly deal with a series of important relationships, strive actively on the new path of the comprehensive construction of a socialist modern country, and continuously open up new frontiers of Chinese-style modernization.
(Deutsche Welle) – The Biden administration on Friday (February 10) blacklisted six Chinese entities for alleged involvement in the spy balloon program.
The U.S. Department of Commerce says the five Chinese companies and one research institute are helping to modernize the Chinese military, particularly in aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
Companies that are blacklisted have difficulty obtaining technology exports from the United States.
The list is known as the "entity list" and companies on it will not be able to purchase technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., the 48th Institute of the China Electronics and Technology Group, Dongguan Lingqu Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Eagleman Aerospace Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhai Xiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd. and Shanxi Eagleman Aerospace Technology Group Co., Ltd.
In the meantime, the White House has indicated that it is considering broader measures to “expose and address” China’s larger-scale surveillance activities that threaten US national security.
The balloon incident sparked further tensions between China and the US, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelled a visit to China.
After the United States shot down a balloon on February 4, the Chinese Government made serious representations to the United States Embassy in China, criticizing the United States for seriously hindering and damaging efforts and processes to stabilize China-United States relations.
From existing evidence of the wreckage and information from Chinese military procurement platforms, the U.S. government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon "had a direct relationship with the People's Liberation Army" and was an approved supplier to the Chinese military.
At a news conference on Friday, Mao Ning, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said that the Chinese side has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position regarding the accidental incident in which a Chinese unmanned airship entered U.S. airspace due to force majeure.
According to the website of the Department of State, she added that the relevant resolution of the United States Congress was purely political manipulation and hype.
China is strongly dissatisfied with this and firmly opposes it.
Matthew Axelrod, Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement at the US Department of Commerce, said: “Today’s action demonstrates our collective efforts to identify and stop China’s use of spy balloons, which have violated the airspace of the United States and more than 40 countries.
‘
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhai Xiang Aircraft Technology Co., Ltd. said he had no knowledge of the sanctions and refused to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not commented on this information.

DEUTSCHLAND (Deutsche Welle) – Days after the earthquake struck parts of Turkey and Syria, the hopes of finding survivors were dampening, but the rescue of a family of five on Saturday was a huge relief for rescuers.
According to Associated Press, this family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days in Nurdayi town, in the severely affected Gaziantep province.
Rescuers first pulled the mother and daughter out of a pile of rubble and then found the father, who insisted that his son and another daughter be rescued first.
When they were all rescued, the crowd cheered.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old man were also successfully rescued in severe cold weather conditions.
"What's going on?"
The boy, who was trapped under the rubble for 129 hours, asked his rescuers after being brought back to the surface.
A man from Kachraman Marash holds his newly rescued cat.
While miraculous rescue successes have given a glimmer of hope to already bleak search and rescue efforts, the death toll is also rising.
So far, Monday’s earthquake has killed more than 20,000 people in Turkey, according to official figures, and more than 3,500 in neighboring Syria.
Although experts say that people can survive trapped in the rubble for a maximum of more than a week, hopes of finding more survivors are becoming increasingly dim.
Rescuers are still using thermal imaging to search for signs of life beneath the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of relief efforts has begun to shift to helping survivors in dire need.
UN Official: The Region’s “100-Year-Old” Disaster
The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, said at a press conference in Turkey that the earthquake was "the worst disaster in a century" in the region.
He also praised Turkey’s response to the disaster as “extraordinary.”
He also told Reuters that he hoped relief could be delivered to areas controlled by both the Syrian government and the opposition, but that it was "not clear".
The United Nations pledged an additional $25 million in relief contributions for the Syrian population affected by the earthquake.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced $25 million in relief for Turkey and Syria.

This year marks the 60th anniversary of China &apos; s dispatch of medical teams abroad, and I would like to express my sincere condolences to the comrades who are carrying out or have carried out medical missions abroad.
He noted that the Chinese people love peace and cherish life, and medical aid abroad is a vivid expression of that.

Google AI chatbot "answer the wrong question" parent company stock price evaporated hundreds of billions of dollars
(Consolidated on 11)
Google's new artificial intelligence chatbot, Bard, was unlucky, "answering the wrong question" in a promotional video, causing Google's parent company Alphabet's stock to plummet 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below $100, evaporating $110 billion (about RM476.5 billion) in market capitalization, closing at $94.57 on Friday.
Markets are concerned that Alphabet is lagging behind competitor Microsoft.
According to Reuters, Google earlier released a promotional video of its AI chatbot Bard on social media, in which Bard is asked, "What new discoveries can I tell my 9-year-old about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)?"
In his reply, Bard mentioned that the telescope had taken the first picture of an extrasolar planet.
However, according to NASA, the first image of an extrasolar planet was taken by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in 2004.
Reuters reported, "Alphabet shares plummet after Bard answers wrong."
Google, on the other hand, stated that Bard's response "highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process" and that it will combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure Bard's response "meets high standards based on quality, safety, and truthful information".
Tourism in Singapore recovers strongly with inbound passengers 19 times higher than in 2021
(Xinhua) -- The Singapore Tourism Board recently announced that it expects 12 million to 14 million international tourists to visit Singapore in 2023, bringing about S$18 billion to S$21 billion in tourism revenues; tourist arrivals and tourism revenues will recover to about 67% to 75% of the pre-COVID-19 level in 2019; and the tourism industry is likely to achieve a full recovery in 2024.
The Singapore tourism market will gradually restart and recover by 2022.
Statistics recently released by the Singapore Tourism Board show that incoming tourists in 2022 will increase 19-fold from 330,600 in 2021 to 6.3 million, exceeding the Board’s earlier estimate of 4 million to 6 million, and tourists have already recovered to pre-pandemic levels of 33%.
From January to September 2022, Singapore’s tourism revenues totaled S$8.96 billion, and full-year tourism revenues in 2022 are expected to reach S$13.8 billion to S$14.3 billion, up from S$1.89 billion in 2021 by a factor of 6 to 7, and already recovering to pre-COVID-19 levels of about 50% to 52%.
The Government of Singapore has taken a number of measures to accelerate the recovery of tourism.
In April 2022, the government announced an allocation of nearly S$500 million to stimulate tourism recovery.
The Tourism Board recently announced plans to allocate S$110 million from this budget over the next two years to launch more commercial and leisure activities to attract returning tourists.
In order to make health and wellness one of Singapore &apos; s tourism highlights, the Singapore Tourism Board issued a call for proposals on 23 November 2022 for the development of a health and wellness destination on Singapore &apos; s south coast.
Wang Ling Li, Executive Director, Sports and Wellness Tourism, Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have placed health at the top of their list of considerations.
The development of a health and wellness destination in Marina South, with its Marina Bay Gardens and Marina Barrage, is expected to contribute to Singapore &apos; s tourism and economy by encouraging tourists to spend and stay longer in Singapore.
Health and wellness will be an important part of Singapore &apos; s tourism product in the coming years, according to the Director of the Singapore Tourism Board, Chen Jianlong.
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, the Tourism Board has been promoting health and wellness programmes to the local public and international tourists over the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board hosted its first ever Health Festival, offering more than 130 different health activities and experiences to the public.
Singapore will continue to offer visitors new travel experiences.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children &apos; s Museum, the Avatar World at Marina Bay Sands, the Central Beach Market at Sentosa, the new &quot; Discover New Territories &quot; exhibition at the Museum of Arts and Sciences, and the new open-air theater at Night Safari, STB will support the development and upgrading of projects such as the Bird Park at World of Birds to make Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
Singapore plans to develop industry standards for meetings, conventions and tourism sustainability awards by 2023, focusing on improving waste management and carbon emissions to further optimize the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
The data shows that as of December 18, 2022, the passenger traffic at Changi Airport has recovered strongly, receiving up to 150,000 passengers per day, about 1 million passengers per week, equivalent to about 75% of the pre-COVID-19 pandemic, and the number of aviation industry employees on duty has also returned to about 90% of the pre-pandemic level.
The data show that between January and October 2022, Singapore has received 23.6 million passengers, equivalent to 42% of pre-COVID-19, and 170,000 flights, 53% of pre-pandemic.
The rapid recovery in tourism has also driven the pace of recovery in sectors such as accommodation, transportation, catering and shopping.
Singapore’s government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Ko Suk Tan, Assistant Director of the International Division of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that a survey by China Travel Platform showed that Singapore &apos; s safety index was among the top three in the world, which was one of the reasons why Singapore was so popular with Chinese tourists.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, about 3.6 million Chinese traveled to Singapore on holiday each year.
As China relaxes its border policies, the number of Chinese tourists is expected to recover to 30% to 60% of 2019 this year.
According to Ko Suk-tan, the Tourism Board will closely monitor China’s further signals regarding outbound travel policies in order to respond to changing tourist demands.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to the new trends in overseas travel in China.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, STB is confident that tourism will recover at a faster pace than expected, provided that the global economy does not experience a significant recession that impacts public revenues and that there are no new large-scale and fatal outbreaks.
Kim Jong-un's daughter, Kim Yo-jong, was born in 1994.
Kim Jong-un's daughter Kim Jong-eun not only attended the military parade on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), but also stood on the podium with her father.
The official North Korean media released a video on September 9, showing Kim Jong-ai hugging her father, watching him warmly and whispering to him several times. She gently touched her father's cheeks with her hands, and even touched her father's chest. The interactive video of the father and daughter was broadcast to the whole country.
However, First Lady Lee Hsien Loong was forced to step aside.
According to reports in South Korea, Kim Jong-un and his wife Lee So-yeon took an official photo with their daughter Kim So-yeon at a dinner on July 7. Kim So-yeon not only rarely sat in the middle of the C-seat with her parents, but she also climbed the podium with Kim Jong-un at the 75th anniversary parade of the Day of the Army the following evening.
North Korea’s official media, KCNA, released footage of the parade afterwards, revealing more of the father-daughter relationship.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times from the podium, and the two never lost their smiles. They whispered in each other’s ears.
Other official media footage also shows Kim Yo-jong continuously touching her father’s face with her hands as they sit on a sofa in the living room, and touching Kim Jong-un’s chest with her hands as she walks hand in hand with her father.
First Lady Lee Hsien Loong walked behind or sat on the side, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
According to South Korean media, Kim Jong-il has been increasingly exposed in the past three months since his first public appearance on November 18, 2017, when he tested a Mars-17 missile. This is his fifth official appearance so far.
The official media referred to Kim Jong-il as “my dearest son,” “my noble son,” and so on. They also broadcast footage of Kim Jong-il standing in the stands overlooking the parade and repeatedly shouting his oath of allegiance to the White Head lineage.
These indications raise questions as to whether Kim Jong-il has already been designated as the successor to the Kim regime, with the Washington Post analysing it as "a signal that Kim Jong-un is pushing his middle-school-aged daughter to the position of successor," although others argue that it is too early to make such a judgment and that, with a son on his lap, all possibilities remain open.
重阳问答︱How to view the US January non-farm employment data greatly exceeded expectations and future trends - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站
Q: What do you think of the U.S. non-farm employment data in January, which largely exceeded expectations, and the future trends?
A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor released January 2023 non-farm employment data, adding 517,000 new non-farm jobs, significantly higher than market expectations of 189,000; unemployment fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; hourly wages increased by 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% year-on-year, slowing slightly.
From an aggregate point of view, there are many one-time and technical disturbances in this data, such as teachers returning to work after a strike, revision of the survey statistical scale, and update of the seasonal adjustment factor, which may be revised in the future (referring to the January 2022 new non-agricultural employment, which was revised down from 504,000 to 364,000), and non-agricultural employment may not be as strong as the data show.
Structurally, the impact of redundancies in high-tech enterprises remains, but at a lower level; new jobs in high-contact services such as leisure hotels, education, and health care have recovered sharply, and data show that the labour gap in services remains.
Combined with a similarly larger-than-expected services PMI, upturns in job vacancy and labor gap data, and strong consumer credit data, we judge that the US services sector has recovered rapidly after the extreme weather and holidays.
In our view, supply-and-demand tensions in the US employment market are unlikely to improve without a recession.
The US labor market currently has a supply gap of more than 5 million, and labor-participation rates are rising slowly, especially for those aged 25-54, which are close to pre-pandemic highs.
In addition, strong consumer demand, owing to excess savings and consumer credit by United States residents, will further delay the impact of austerity on the job market.
Continued supply-and-demand tensions in the US job market will underscore the US economy in 2023.
We are not optimistic about a continued slowdown in wage growth, given the recurring inflation expectations and the near-end of the current interest-rate hike.
Prior to this data release, US equity and bond markets were overly optimistic about the Fed’s path to interest rate hikes.
As inflation data continued to improve, the Fed maintained a fragile balance between slowing the pace of rate hikes and maintaining market inflation expectations. But markets ignored the Fed’s falconry, expecting not only an early end to the hikes, but also two rate cuts by the end of the year.
Given the tight supply and demand in the labor market and the uncertain impact of austerity, we believe the Fed’s guidance for interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and extreme adjustments in market expectations and trading crowds are likely to cause some harm to the market.
Nevertheless, the persistence of wage growth is unlikely to change the current rapid decline in inflation. With M2 data going negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of the leading indicators of various CPI subcomponents, the US CPI data since October has moved into a rapid decline phase, the persistence of wage growth will only form a base for subsequent inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of play after the next inflation data is released.
杉杉创始人郑永刚因突发心脏病逝世 曾带领中国服装第一股转型 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站
On February 11, 2023, the official Weibo account of the certified entity, Sugisugi Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Sugisugi Holdings"), announced that the founder of Sugisugi Enterprises and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sugisugi Holdings, Zheng Yonggang, died on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65, due to a sudden heart attack.
In the 1980s, he was the director of a state-owned cotton spinning mill, and in 1989, he became the director of the Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Sumi-Sumi.
In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd Annual Meeting of China Enterprise Future Stars, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the market share of the Sugi Sugi brand was as high as 37%.
In 1996, Sugisugi Co., Ltd. (600884.SH) became the first listed company in the Chinese clothing industry.
Just as the clothing business was flourishing, the Sumi-Sui Group began to transform, because Zheng realized that, “Once the market is opened up, Chinese brands will naturally form a ladder-style brand market, and Sumi-Sui’s western clothing is unlikely to be the national clothing of the country in the long term.”
In 1999, Su Su began to study enterprise transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalls, “We came to Shanghai to find out what transformation was all about.
Finally, we set out two broad strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is a future for great health.”
At that time, the Carbon Research Institute of the Anshan Institute of Thermal Energy was working on the National 863 Project for Anshan Steel, and the research funds were insufficient. Therefore, Sugisugi and the Carbon Research Institute of the Anshan Institute of Thermal Energy signed a cooperation agreement, jointly promoting the industrialization of the National 863 Project "Intermediate Phase Carbon Microspheres", engaged in the research and development, production and sales of negative-pole materials, and achieved the commercial promotion of negative-pole materials in the country.
In 2001, Sugisugi Co., Ltd. achieved the scale production of intermediate phase carbon microspheres, and began to substitute domestic production, replacing Japan as the main domestic supplier of intermediate phase carbon microspheres.
It is China's first lithium-ion battery negative electrode material production enterprise, and achieved the domestication of lithium-ion battery negative electrode material.
With the rapid spread of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Sugisugi began to gradually develop. In 2007, the lithium electric materials business was written into the main business of Sugisugi, and the revenue share of the clothing business decreased year by year until 2013, when the revenue of the lithium electric materials business of Sugisugi fully exceeded that of the clothing business.
In February 2021, Sumitomo Corporation successfully acquired LG's chemical polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer company Sumitomo Optoelectronics. The technology content in this field is relatively high, and Sumitomo's main competitors are the world's top 500, such as Samsung of Korea, Sumitomo Chemical of Japan, and Nitto Electric.
“When Chinese private firms acquire international high-tech companies, the likelihood of success is low. Why do those acquisitions fail?
Because everyone will consider, I spent so much money, I have to send people to control it, this is a behavior that is usually done. However, Zheng Yonggang is different, on the day of the successful acquisition of Sugisugi, Zheng Yonggang publicly announced that Sugisugi, as a major shareholder of Sugikin, decided to implement a one-business-two-system, except for Zheng Yonggang serving as chairman, Sugisugi enterprise people do not send to Sugikin, adopting the authorized operating method, the original distribution system, corporate culture, various management and other models remain unchanged.
ICC Xin Pa information released 2022 negative terminal data showed that 2022 shipments of 杉杉 negative terminal exceeded 200,000 tons, an increase of 100% year-on-year, market share of 16%, and artificial graphite negative terminal material shipments ranked first.
In the polarizer business, Yano Research statistics show that the global market share of the company's Sumitomo Photonics reached 29% in 2022, and the market share is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to be the world's largest.
In the first three quarters of 2022, the revenue of Sugisugi shares was 15.841 billion yuan, net profit was 2.313 billion yuan, on February 10, the share price of Sugisugi shares was 19.24 yuan / share, and the total market capitalization was 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Sugisugi Co., Ltd. said on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite production capacity will be about 100,000 tons, and the graphite production capacity of the Meishan project is still on the rise.
Mante indicates that, at present, Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and effective controller of Sugisugi Co., Ltd.
According to Tencent, Zheng Yonggang holds 40.1% of the total share capital of SugiSugi Holdings Co., Ltd.
The General Manager of Sumi-Sui Co., Ltd. is Mr. Li Zhihua, born in 1968, who served as Chairman of Dongguan Sumi-Sui Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Sumi-Sui New Materials Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Sumi-Sui Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and Deputy General Manager of Ningbo Sumi-Sui Co., Ltd.
On February 10, Sugisugi Co., Ltd. stated on its investor interaction platform that there is no relationship between the senior management of the company and the beneficial owner of the company.
"Fund E account" is here: the Securities and Exchange Commission authorized the development of all funds under the name of investors to achieve the collection and query - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站
Economic Observatory Reporter Chen San The proliferation of fund purchase channels leads to the account information is not easy to gather?
Always Forgetting the “Little Vault”?
These problems of Christians are about to be solved.
On February 10, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that the "Fund E Account" app was launched in various mobile app stores and conducted a public test run.
It was introduced that "fund E account" for individual investors to provide publicly traded fund account and share information "one-stop" query service, aimed at solving a wide range of small and medium-sized investors forget account, query tedious and other industry service pain points.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there will be 156 publicly traded fund managers in China, managing funds worth about 26 trillion yuan; 167 publicly traded fund share registration agencies, and 411 publicly traded fund sales agencies.
The accounting systems of the various share registers are separate from each other and lack industry-wide accessibility.
Some industry people said that at the end of 2021, China's fund investors exceeded 720 million people, which means that half of the country has invested in fund products.
Previously, investors had to inquire about their purchases through different sales agencies, but through the “Fund E Account” they can inquire about the purchases from all sales channels, holding the fund at a glance.
What is the Fund E-Account App?
According to the relevant document, the "Fund E Account" APP is a mobile application developed by China Securities and Exchange Commission approved by China Securities and Exchange Commission, which can provide investors with a one-stop query on the off-exchange holdings of publicly traded funds in the entire market.
Investors can easily and quickly control their holdings of OTC shares of publicly traded fund products owned by various fund managers purchased through various sales channels in the market through the "Fund E Account", which improves the efficiency of querying.
Specifically, investors can access information on fund accounts opened with publicly traded fund managers across the market, trading accounts opened with publicly traded fund sales agencies, and off-exchange holdings of products including publicly traded securities investment funds and collective asset management plans managed by securities companies with a maximum number of investors of 200.
Liu Yichen, head of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation and Research Center, told reporters that investors can use the "Fund E Account" app to know all their OTC holdings, help them find back "forgotten assets", and more importantly, the full account information of the integrated fund investment situation is collected for customers, helping customers to more timely, accurate and complete control of their investment situation, thus better optimizing their own fund portfolio configuration, and better planning their own financial arrangements.
How to register?
Reporters noted that at present, the "fund e account" app has been listed in Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, vivo and other mobile application stores, but the app is still in the public trial phase, registration needs to fill in the invitation code, investors can contact the fund manager of the fund held to obtain.
A customer service representative of a large- and medium-sized publicly traded fund in Shanghai gave a 6-digit invitation code to reporters from Economic Observer. He told reporters, “During the trial phase of the app, China Securities will provide a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager.
Once the trial run is over, the invitation code will no longer be required for open user registration.
‘
According to the Securities and Exchange Commission's website, the journalists downloaded and used the relevant documents for account registration and completed the query. The entire process took only a few minutes and was mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real name verification, fund account binding, and publicly traded fund query.
After authenticating the real name, pressing the "Asset" fund binding button, all the fund products purchased by the journalist through the various fund sales platforms are presented in the list of binding options (the account can be linked). After completing the binding, the journalist can visually see the total assets of the invested fund and can start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the “Fund E Account” provides investors with a query service only, and does not allow for redemption transactions.
The data dates displayed in the “Fund E Account” are generally three trading days forward from the date of the user’s query (day T).
For example, if the “Fund E” account is opened on February 10, the total assets, fund shares, and fund net worth on the assets page will correspond to three trading days forward from that date, i.e. February 7.

U.S.-Philippines Defence Consensus
ASIA – On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan to meet with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the Chinese Communist Party's violations of the South China Sea and the East Sea. After the meeting, the leaders of Fiji and Japan issued a joint statement stating that they would sign a trilateral defense agreement with the United States, conduct substantive defense exchanges, and oppose the Chinese Communist Party's hegemonic policy.
According to the Japanese media, Kishida hopes to use the meeting to help Japan and the Philippines develop policies to address the Taiwan crisis.
Marcos Jr. visited China in early January and secured $20 billion worth of deals.
But since then, China-Philippines relations have declined rather than improved.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States, agreeing to open more bases to US forces to secure the South China Sea.
One of the new bases is located 300 kilometres from Taiwan, which is also one of the closest locations to China.
In the event of a crisis in Taiwan, US forces could launch operations from bases in the Philippines.
According to Japanese media, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines are now forming an axis with the US, creating an “anti-CCP arc” in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Song Tao, Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang Party, delivered a speech during the visit: Under the 92nd Consensus, we welcome the visit of the Green Camp
Vice-Chairman of the Nationalist Party of China on Taiwan, Xia Lijian, met with Director of the State Taiwan Office of China, Song Tao, and Standing Committee Member of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Wang Huning.
Last night, Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the Nationalist Party’s official agency, the National Policy Foundation, was interviewed by the Taiwan Central News Agency. He positively commented on Song Tao’s comments that as long as the Greens agree with the “September 2nd Consensus” and oppose Taiwan’s independence, China will welcome them to visit the mainland.
The Nationalist Party considers this to be a novelty.
This was not mentioned in the news of the day when Xia Lijian met Song Tao earlier in the day.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan has repeatedly clarified its refusal to accept the 92 Consensus.
According to the Central News Agency (CNA) today, Kuomintang (KMT) Deputy Chairman Xie Lijian led the delegation, and during his stay in Beijing, he met Wang Huning, Standing Committee Member of the CPC Central Political Bureau, Song Tao, newly appointed Director of the State Taiwan Office, and Yin Li, Secretary of the Beijing City Committee.
During the meeting, Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the Kuomintang National Policy Foundation, said that the Kuomintang’s “Consensus of 92” is the “Consensus of 92” in its purest form.
According to Zhao Chunshan, this was a different experience from the previous meetings he had attended.
In recent video conferences with scholars from the mainland, as well as in this conference, we did not hear scholars from Taiwan talking about the Mutianyu Line and the “anti-secession law.” Instead, we heard about the resumption of exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the two sides were at war, and that mainland China hoped to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust among the DCP, the other party still wants to do good work for the Taiwanese people, and the representative does not want the relations between the two sides to go bad.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning personally instructed Song Tao that "you must implement their (Taiwan farmers and fishermen's) demands," and that if it is not possible to solve the problem in a comprehensive manner, it will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
The report did not mention whether Kuomintang officials visiting the mainland addressed the daily disturbance of Taiwan by Chinese warplanes and warships, the agricultural and fisheries problems of a small number of Taiwanese counties and cities, or whether interviews with journalists from the Central News Agency raised such issues.
Lawyers' Unions Mobilize Again Against Government's Retirement Reforms
On Saturday (11 February), French trade unions once again launched a national mobilization against the government's draft pension reform, calling on people to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action in the social uprising against the government's proposed pension reforms.
And how many people respond to the call for a rally may influence the union group’s next course of action.
For the fourth time in a month, France’s eight major trade union groups have launched a national mobilization, and for the first time the protests will take place on a Saturday.
Given that Saturday is a public holiday for most French people, who do not have to choose between participating in a demonstration or a wage-cut strike, the trade union group hopes that today’s rally will attract more people.
The unions of the public bus system, the subway, and the public railways have not called for strikes today. The public bus system should function normally, and people should be able to travel to the venues of the rallies. At the same time, people should be able to start their holidays as usual in the areas where the winter school holidays have begun.
Trade union groups are hoping for more than a million people to rally today, while the police are forecasting between 600,000 and 800,000 nationwide, and between 90,000 and 120,000 in the metropolitan area of Paris.
Since the start of the protests against the government’s pension reforms, the number of people actually taking to the streets has been decreasing, although polls show that the majority of French people do not support raising the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64.
The first strike demonstrations on 31 January brought together between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people across the country.
On Tuesday, February 7, the number of demonstrators had shrunk to between 757,000 and two million across the country.
This pension reform programme is currently under discussion in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, particularly those led by the Radical Left, have submitted so many amendments that the process of consideration has been very slow.
And the dispute among Asano is becoming increasingly heated.
A parliamentarian from the radical left-wing party France Insoumise recently posted a photo on social media of himself stepping on a balloon bearing the head of the Labour Minister, prompting protests from the ruling party.
The President of the National Assembly eventually imposed a 15-day ban on the member &apos; s participation in parliamentary activities as a punishment for such behaviour.
Despite the fact that this reform has triggered the largest social upheaval in France in more than 20 years, the Government has not made any major concessions to date, although it has made minor adjustments to the draft.
The unions are preparing to re-launch their action next Thursday, March 16, and they also plan to organize demonstrations on March 7, when the bill will be discussed in the Senate.
China Encourages Higher Fertility Rates, Calls on Universities to Donate Sperm, High Quality Standards
On September 9, the human sperm bank in the Yunnan province of China issued an advertisement, asking people with higher education or school students to donate sperm, successfully donating 8 to 12 times can receive a subsidy of RMB 4,500.
According to Taiwan media reports today, the message was searched heavily on Weibo that day and triggered follow-up initiatives in many provinces and cities, including Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing.
According to a Free Times report, China encourages university students to donate sperm.
The highest donation threshold is in Beijing, where, in addition to educational qualifications, the donor must be at least 170 cm tall, have an orderly appearance, no visible hair loss, and a myopia of no more than 600 degrees.
According to the report, the human sperm bank in Yunnan stated that sperm donors can obtain a complete male medical examination worth 1,000 yuan, "especially sperm and chromosome tests, most people have never done, and is important to know their fertility status."
Conditions for sperm donors include a height of 165 cm or more, a university degree or higher, or being a student, and not suffering from colour blindness or genetic or infectious diseases such as hepatitis B.
The report quoted Chinese news agency Xinhua as saying that the human sperm bank in the Shaanxi province printed posters with the slogan "paid sperm donation, unlimited glory", calling on young people to respond to sperm donation, and encouraging netizens to forward the message, "let the love spread".
In Shaanxi, the price is higher than in Yunnan, and eligible donors receive RMB 300 in cash each time, and RMB 5,000 in subsidies for completing a certain number of donations.
The highest price currently known is in Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5,150 yuan.
East Germany's last communist chancellor dies
The successor of the East German Communist Party reported in a party statement, "Last night Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.
As a result, our party has lost an important leader.
‘
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, was opened, Modrow said he would help turn East Germany into a democratic country.
At that time, communist leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union, he called for change in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe.
In March 1990, Mudros declared the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election resulted in his resignation as Prime Minister.
Despite his reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political change and reunification that took place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to re-establish, rather than abolish, the secret police.
In 1993, Modrow was found guilty of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but did not go to jail.
It was alleged that the charges were politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Moder continued to serve in the German Bundestag, and from 1999 to 2004, he was a member of the European Parliament.
Modrow saw himself as a reformer and wanted to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want a return to the old East Germany, but that its achievements should be recognized.
Born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica in Poland), Modrow was trained as a mechanic.
During the Second World War, he served as a platoon commander in a youth fire brigade, and near the end of the conflict became a member of the Volkssturm, the Nazi militia that conscripted men aged 16 to 60 for the final struggles of the war.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by the Soviet army and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he attended anti-fascist courses and became a committed Communist.
In 1949, the year of the founding of East Germany, he returned to Germany, where he found a job as a mechanic and continued his studies in social sciences and economics, obtaining a doctorate.
Modro was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, which almost all young East Germans joined, and rose through the ruling Social Unity Party (SED) to become chairman of the Dresden regional party between 1973 and 1989.
He also served in the East German parliament for over 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state office.
Iran marks anniversary of revolution, hackers hacked presidential TV speech in support of protests
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Raisi’s televised address.
The live TV broadcast of the president's speech was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute, with a banner of a group of anti-government hackers named "Edalat Ali" (Justice Ali) appearing on the screen.
There was also a voice shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic".
According to a Reuters report today, hackers interrupted state television reporting as Iran commemorated the anniversary of the revolution.
As Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Raisi’s hardline government faces its boldest challenge from young protesters calling for its ouster, but he still calls on the “deceived youth” to repent so that they can be pardoned by Iran’s supreme leader.
Nationwide protests continue to sweep Iran, following the death in September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in custody of the country’s morality police.
The Iranian security forces’ deadly crackdown on protests has been one of the most formidable challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since the 1979 revolution overthrew a 2,500-year-old monarchy.
As part of an amnesty commemorating the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities on Friday released imprisoned dissidents on hunger strike, Farah Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelhaj.
Earlier, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, issued an amnesty decree that included some of the prisoners arrested during the recent anti-government protests.
According to the human rights organization HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors.
A further 70 Government security personnel were reportedly killed.
As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been calling for voting at Saturday rallies to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On Friday night, the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media showed fireworks as part of government-sponsored celebrations, and people shouted “Allahu Akbar!”
("God is great!").
However, the rally also heard many shouting "Death to the dictator!
"The Death of the Islamic Republic" in a video posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live footage of official rallies across the country.
In Tehran, nationally produced anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were displayed as part of official celebrations.
President Lacy's speeches were often interrupted by shouts of "Death to America"—a signature slogan of state rallies.
The crowd also shouted "Death to Israel".
According to Reuters, Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on national security charges.
She was subsequently placed under house arrest, but returned to prison in January.
Adelkhah denied the allegations.
A week before his release, supporters warned that he was at risk of death as a result of his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the mandatory headscarf.
The French Foreign Ministry on Friday welcomed Adelkhah's release, calling for her freedom to be restored, "including allowing her to return to France if she so wishes."

Does the Balloon Affair Brighten America’s Eyes?
Strengthening restrictions on technology exports to China
According to the Wall Street Journal today, after the balloon incident, the United States is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials have said that the balloon incident highlights the national security threat posed by China, and will lead to more political support for strengthening U.S. technological protection.
The United States claims that the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communications.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official who now serves at the New American Security Center at the Washington-based think tank.
"This has undoubtedly fueled the fire and supported the views of the hardliners against China".
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, “We will also consider broader actions to expose and respond to China’s increased surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security and to our allies and partners.”
U.S. officials said they had informed the governments of more than 30 countries about the balloon incident, and that international coordination was essential to counter the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that, in addition to the Biden administration’s actions, the US House of Representatives’ newly formed Special Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Communist Party of China may put pressure on the US to take tougher measures to slow China’s development.
She said Congressmen would feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which in turn could force the White House to adopt tougher policies.
According to The Wall Street Journal, many of those who advocate tighter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The US government is also developing an overseas investment review program to examine US investments abroad for potential national security threats from China.
According to analysts, the White House may face calls to launch the program faster.
Syria earthquake relief night after day
Since the powerful earthquake struck Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working day and night in the ruins of thousands of destroyed buildings to rescue survivors buried under the rubble.
In the freezing temperatures, they often appealed for silence as they struggled to hear any sound of life from the dilapidated concrete piles.
Reuters reported today that two more women were rescued after surviving several days in the rubble of the earthquake.
However, the number of deaths caused by the earthquake rose to 24,150.
The number of deaths in Turkey was 20,665 and in Syria more than 3,500.
Monday’s 7.8-magnitude earthquake, followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similarly powerful earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Rescuers rescued two women from the rubble of a collapsed building in Turkey after they were trapped for 122 hours after the region's deadliest earthquake in 20 years, Turkish authorities said on Saturday.
Another injured man, identified as Masallah Cicek, 55, was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In freezing temperatures, rescuers often called for silence as they struggled to hear any sound of life from the dilapidated concrete piles.
In the Samandag district of Turkey, rescuers crouched under concrete slabs, whispering “Inshallah” – “God bless” – as they carefully reached into the rubble to rescue a 10-day-old baby.
He opened his eyes and saw the baby, Yagiz Ulas, wrapped in a blanket and carried to the field hospital.
The video images show that the first responders also took away his mother, who was on a stretcher, dizzy and pale, but clear-headed.
Overnight, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, with a total of 31,000 rescue workers deployed in the affected areas.
He said that some 80,000 people were being treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million people had become homeless as a result of the earthquake and were crowded into temporary shelters.
As many people lack food in cold winter conditions, the public is increasingly questioning both leaders’ response to the disaster.
According to official Syrian media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad traveled to a hospital in Aleppo with his wife Asma, reportedly for the first time since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme indicated that its stocks in the rebel-controlled north-western part of Syria were nearing exhaustion, as the state of war complicated relief efforts.
On Friday, Erdoğan visited Turkey’s Adana province, where he acknowledged that the government’s response had not been as rapid as expected.
Opponents have taken this issue to attack Erdoğan, who will run for re-election in a vote on May 14 that may be postponed by the disaster.
According to Reuters, anger over delays in the delivery of aid and initiation of relief efforts could affect the elections.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as Erdoğan’s most daunting challenge in his two decades in office.
Erdoğan called for unity, and condemned what he called a “passive campaign for political gain.”
Turkey's main opposition leader Kemal Kiliçdaroğlu criticized the government's response.
Critics said, "The earthquake was great, but worse than the earthquake was the lack of coordination, lack of planning, and incompetence."

Hanoi, Feb. 11 (VNA) - On the morning of Feb. 11, Prime Minister Phan Minh Triet and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD) during their visit to the country.
The University of Brunei is the largest centre of higher education and scientific research in Brunei and ranks third among universities in the region.
The University of Brunei is one of the symbols of Vietnam-Brunei cooperation in education and training.
In July 2013, the University of Brunei formally established cooperation with FPT University of Vietnam, with English training as the main area of cooperation.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, Mandarin, Japanese and Korean, Vietnamese is included in the curriculum of the University of Brunei Darussalam.
During his visit to the University of Brunei Darussalam, the Prime Minister of the Government of Viet Nam, Mr. Pham Minh Chính, and his wife exchanged views with the students of the Vietnamese language course.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chính was pleased that an increasing number of foreigners liked to learn Vietnamese, thus making an active contribution to the promotion of Vietnamese cultural characteristics and the image of the country &apos; s people throughout the world.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chính expressed his confidence and hope that the Vietnamese language faculty at the University of Brunei Darussalam will become stronger and stronger, and that the students of the Vietnamese language course will become more and more interested in the Vietnamese language, will study hard, will be able to use the Vietnamese language fluently at an early age, and will become ambassadors of the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.
Prime Minister Phan Minh Triet also took the opportunity to communicate via video with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Center in Da Nang, to learn about their learning, especially during the pandemic.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chính said that the cooperation between FPT University and UBD, especially the FPT-UBD Global Center, is a living symbol of Vietnam-Brunei education cooperation.
At the same time, it is hoped that the students of the center will make greater progress in their studies and make a positive contribution to the friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and China.
In his discussions with the Minister of Education of Brunei and the leadership of the University of Brunei, Prime Minister Phan Minh Khai highly appreciated the results achieved in education cooperation between the two countries, including cooperation between FPT University and the University of Brunei, and the initiative of the University of Brunei to incorporate Vietnamese into the curriculum.
The Prime Minister hoped that the University would continue to focus on ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expand the size of Vietnamese language classes.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chính also appreciated the positive results of cooperation between the two countries on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding on Education Cooperation signed in April 2014, and recommended that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively implement short-term exchange training programs such as the Global Discovery Programme and the Discovery Year.
Prime Minister Phan Minh Triet expressed his appreciation for the establishment of the first branch of the University of Brunei in Southeast Asia in Viet Nam, and expressed his confidence that the University will continue to strengthen its development in the region and the world, and further expand its cooperation with Vietnamese universities and colleges.
On the occasion, the Prime Minister and his wife planted a memorial tree on the campus of the University of Brunei Darussalam and left a message in the memorial book.
Prime Minister Phan Minh Triet wished the University of Brunei to continue to develop, contribute more and more to the educational cause of Brunei, and develop deeper and broader cooperation with various educational and training institutions in Viet Nam.

What Was the “Object” Downed Over Alaska?
I'm confused. I'm guessing.
On Friday afternoon (February 10), the U.S. military once again used the country's most advanced stealth fighter jet, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska, U.S.
The crash site was 10 miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that U.S. forces have shot down a flying object.
Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China was shot down near the US coast of South Carolina after drifting through US airspace for days.
The Pentagon said the second object that was shot down entered U.S. airspace for the first time on Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), about the size of a small car and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.
The Pentagon also believes that there are no indications that the object is manoeuvrable.
White House National Security Council Strategic Communications Coordinator John Corby said on Friday that while the exact appearance of the high-flying object was not clear, it "possessed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."
According to Corby, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, the object did not carry a "payload".
Corby said, "To call it an 'object' is the best description we can give at the moment."
President Biden listened to the advice of the Pentagon before ordering the object to be shot down, and he was "very cautious" in making the decision, Corby added.
The United States official description of the object can be roughly summarized as follows: the size of a small car, no joystick, no suspension, flying at an altitude of about 10,000 metres.
But that information does not answer basic questions, such as what the object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is performing.
A lot of analysis and speculation on the Internet now suggests that this could be another Chinese balloon.
It may have come from China, just like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that hovered over Latin America, both of which were on a mission in different locations.
The "object" in Alaska has also been linked to "unidentifiable flying objects" (UFOs).
The U.S. News & World Report quoted former U.S. Representative Peter Meijer as tweeting on Friday, "Hopefully this 'unidentified flying object' is also a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO."
“The irony of mixing alien spaceships with weather balloons is surprising, but it’s not worth triggering an interstellar conflict,” says Major.
Major tweeted shortly after Coby confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
According to Newsweek, Major was not the only one to suspect that the object was a UFO.
Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee criticized the government’s intelligence cover-up last month, asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on “unidentified flying objects.”
Amazon customer service attitude makes me hard to believe
I guess few people are here, but I would like to say a few words.
The dress was a zipper when we bought it, and it was a short-sleeved shirt when it was given to me.
After receiving the clothes immediately contacted Amazon customer service, at that time confirmed that the clothes were still in stock, I requested exchange, customer service said to solve it, then immediately see the product name changed to short sleeves, it turned out that I bought links off the shelf.
The customer service then advises the customer to either keep the goods for a certain amount of money or to return the goods.
Is that how Amazon deals with it?
It’s hard to believe that it wasn’t my problem that the clothes were wrong. As a consumer, I asked for what I was entitled to, without making any exaggerated demands, and Amazon changed its name and said it was out of stock.
This is my first long review and I hope it will not be the last.
Sleeves that are incomprehensible
It is hard to say that it is cowhide, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks, it is not clear whether it is leather, and the sleeves of this garment are really incomprehensible, usually the sleeves of the jacket are longer than the coat, but usually 1-2 centimeters, this garment is 5 centimeters long, the arms should naturally droop in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this garment cover the fingers.
Clothing is easy to buy and easy to return.
But when will the money be paid back?
The workmanship of the garments was good, but I had to return them because they were too small. It has been more than a week since I returned the garments, and I have not received a refund.
And if the buyer has to contact the dishonest UPS, it's the worst purchase since buying from Amazon!
But the store is still good, actively cooperate with expediting express and timely refund, but this full-peak express real work is done quite angry, dragging about half a month to refund, this partner is to drag the back leg of Amazon, poor work efficiency, no service awareness!
More suitable for young people
99 seconds to kill.
The workmanship, color and feel of the trousers are good, soft/medium thickness, no kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the format is slim and more suitable for young people.
3XL, waist 2 ft. 5 in., maximum stretch 4 ft., 1.79/80 lbs., slightly tight at waist.
It seems that there are no loose waist belts, and it is difficult to loosen them.
In addition, they are uncomfortable to wear.
Very good. The color isn't very bright.
This is the first time I've seen it.
The first time Amazon used the cooperation of the daily rotten express, the first time the delivery was not at home, then the initiative and the courier agreed on two times the delivery time, the courier did not deliver, then directly returned the goods to me, the fucking courier has no integrity, strongly recommended not to use the daily rotten express again.
This time, a shirt was returned to me, and the price was raised by more than $100.
This page should not be displayed.
The product special offer when purchased, the price is not low, see the review is also a very good product.
When I actually received the product, I was amazed, the surface of the goods large areas of wear, many other places are worn, not inferior or old products, later on the picture.
I applied for a return, the manufacturer's people see the picture after saying that it was caused by transportation, isn't it stupid?
How could the inside of the goods be worn out?
There were only two possibilities: either it was a substandard product, or I deliberately damaged it and returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence that I have not damaged the goods, but with my credit record on Amazon shopping, I think that such goods should not appear in Amazon self-service goods, customers choose Amazon self-service is trust, customer win, we win, the victory of the customer is the victory of the manufacturer, I hope everyone can work together to improve, thank you.
I have been using the product for less than a year and I have two E2s, I don't know what to do?
I bought the goods on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016 receiver right two groups often appear red E2, should be the launcher module problems, this with the Amazon website speaking of the launcher module sustainable work 7 years is not very consistent, on the Amazon website and find no after-sales, now I do not know how it is good?
I'm fine.
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn't feel like new.
The labels on the boxes were torn and the labels on the aircraft were broken.
And it's always a white screen.
"I'll do it."
The changeover is fast, a little blurry at night, the view is not very wide, but it is enough for the average household.
The shortcomings are that it doesn't have a card, it's own purchase, and it's a phone I bought from Amazon before.
There is a sticker on the packaging to prevent it from being opened, which was not present, and when I bought the phone, there was a sticker-like stamp that could be affixed to the warranty card, which was not present.
I don't know if it's cheaper or not, I'm confused.
Waiting for a reply from the supplier
The packaging does not have any markings, directly to the supplier said, answered no mark is genuine, if suspected can be mailed to Johnson Company inspection of goods, also leave the license plate and telephone number, promised to send a text message to enter my information in the Johnson website warranty card, to now also confiscated the text message?
Oil was delivered in the morning and replaced in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
I'm very confident.
The master who changed the oil said that the oil was clear and that it was indeed good oil.
It's the second time I've bought it.
It's a good thing.
The delivery was fast, the packaging was spotless, and after using this oil, the engine noise decreased noticeably.
Value for money is good, less than 200 is difficult to find synthetic engine oil.
Support the star crown, support the winning card, effectively protect the car.
Amazon Japan seriously damages buyers &apos; interests due to customer service problems (8c bugs delivered as 8cm bugs) (8c = 14cm, 8cm = 2c)
The error was acknowledged but continued to be pushed, always emphasizing that the goods were a third party and could not bind the third party.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
I bought the page size options for 7c, 8, 9c, then thought it was a trap, call the customer service, clearly informing 8 is 8c, but the goods back to China to discover, only 8cm, I think it is a deliberate trap to fool Chinese (according to Amazon after sales), now view the page has no option.
We are sorry to bring you loss, we give you two ways to go:
1, You return the goods, the buyer bears all the shipping costs.
2, you do not return the goods, we compensate you 1000 yen.
(I calculate, shoes 4000+ yen, 200rmb, option 1, I have no shoes, loss 200 yen.)
Option 2, I have shoes, finally compensated me 2000 yen, the final loss in 150rmb Customer service: We have recorded, we will deal seriously, the next day returned the mail, saying I do not accept the Chinese customer service mediation, that's it.
I suggested: the purchase page is 7c, 8, 9c such confusing options, Chinese customer service helped me say about the common Japanese code is not with c like that, similar to 140 like that, but do you so go to other bugs page look?
There is a mixture of US and Japanese codes.
Also, why do you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, which is the smallest size, what do you mean by that?
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we do not know that you want to ship back to your country, so we will not compensate your shipping costs.
I don't understand this logic. I'm a Japanese, and I need Chinese customer service. Chinese living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service, and tourists visiting Japan don't have the skills to make long-distance international calls.
Doesn't Amazon's Chinese customer service make it easier for these people to shop online?
This purchase is not very satisfied
This is the second time from Amazon purchase help baby fit diaper, had bought a box when the baby was 2 months old, chose the European import paper diaper, the first purchase experience is more satisfied, the baby used a diaper all night, indeed can satisfy 12 hours without changing diapers.
But this time the purchase of L size diaper, in a box with 2 packs of separate packaging, after opening the paper feels loose, with the import help baby fit a clear difference, to the baby after use, it's okay, there is no leakage of urine and no red rash and other signs.
But with the second pack of diapers, a red rash appeared on the inside of the baby's thighs immediately after the start of use, which has not faded yet.
It's not the same thing.
I'm not going to buy it again!
Want to pay attention to the transport protection of the package
This is my online shopping for so long, see the worst once packaging transport, absolutely no protection measures, buffer foam, wrapping buffer layer material, etc., nothing.
It's about a box that's been squeezed and deformed.
And the inside of the soft box is packed, the cardboard box is pressed open and pressed to deform.
I hope it's genuine. Quality is guaranteed, and after that I don't dare to buy anything from Amazon.
It is preferable to be half as expensive at home, with some guarantees.
And the packaging of commodity products, I see the comments in 2016, some commented, now 19 years, still the same.
This indicates that Amazon does not value service feedback at all, and it is too far from the domestic K-DONG, TianKat, etc.
Nice, but a little bit of a pity.
I like the color of the whole cup, orange-red, and although my family is male, I still think orange-red with yellow is very eye-catching.
It's smaller than I expected, but it was meant to be taken out, so it's acceptable.
I took it home last night and tried it. After pushing the lid, the distance between the straw and the lid is too close, because the position of the straw is perpendicular to the right, so my son always has to drink water with the bump on the top of the lid, thinking that this place could be improved.
It seems that other brands of straw cups make the straw inclined or reason, small children's stuff, really cares about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and large capacity
I like it lightweight, big opening, just the two separate separation bags are a bit redundant for me, I don't know what to put in.
After buying it, I discovered that there was another brand that was very similar on Alibaba, for less than 200 yuan.
It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fa
Amazon sells fakes, and so do I.
The customer service said that because it was used so can not return, I did not know how to know it was fake.
After all, it is the face mask supplies, really go to the physical store to buy, recognize a little more expensive.
I have not read the comments, because it is the second kill, I have submitted to the e-commerce platform of the State Directorate of Industry and Commerce, let's defend our rights together.
Broken?
Fake?
In short, a tragedy.
When I used the second piece, the pores were fine, but as soon as I opened it, there was a strange smell, I thought it was normal, because I had not used it, and then when I put it on my face, I could not stand it, it smelled very bad, it was indescribable, I coughed it out immediately, my eyes were very sore, I shed tears, and I immediately took it off to wash my face.
It's not as bad as it sounds, and it's not as bad as it looks.
It tasted a little like the taste of bad quality hairspray in a barbershop.
Is it unthinkable that Amazon’s own skin-care products will have to be shunned?
You're a crook.
At the time of purchase, the activity page is said full 99 yuan gift "three-piece set", the receipt of goods without this gift, call customer service said to show them the screenshot of the activity at the time, the problem is who buys things and save the web page screenshot, you have done your own activities, and need customers to help you provide, buyers next time to keep an eye, preserve evidence.
Feeling after use
First time to buy something on Amazon, there are several different feelings, first of all, let's talk about the feeling of the end of the goods, the first is indeed painless, and there is no stimulating taste of things, overall very good, wait for about 8 minutes to wipe off, just have a small amount of sweat residue on it, if you don't look carefully, you can't see it, so overall it's good, as for the rest, use it once and continue to observe, continue to use it, you'll know.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
The second from the 27th order, 12th received the goods, a total of 15 days is half a month, Amazon delivery service attitude is also good.
Third, Amazon's Black Friday do not believe it, Friday order, wait two days and cheaper to close to 12 bucks, that is, I bought 170 (plus shipping and so on), a kind of activity to raise the price of the feeling.
Customer service said what price fluctuations, I paid attention to 10 days price is the same, fluctuations are not great.
Affordable, Japanese origin, with Chinese label, with granules, absolutely buy back!
In the body of the ointment with particles, freshness just right, after the teeth smooth, much better than a second-hand thing, there is said to be imported things, but a lot of things do not have Chinese labels, I do not know where to wholesale.
As long as Amazon exists, there will be no second-hand shops.
Give a suggestion, the Amazon app on the list how to sometimes sunbathe, hope to improve some applications, will do better and better!
Excellent these years, worse and worse, there is no quality of service!
Special delivery time 19:00-22:00 when placing an order.
Because of the presence of a post-operatively bedridden elderly person in the family, it was only possible to receive the letters at night.
As a result, it was delivered directly to the door at 12 noon, without prior notification by telephone.
If your couriers can deliver at whatever time they want, why pretend to give your customers a choice?
If your own logistics can not guarantee the service, then simply do not do e-commerce!
Get an old man out of bed with three wounds on his body, open the door for a courier, and find a change to pay for it!
There's a contact number on the order!
From the beginning to the end, no one called to explain!
ExcellenceNet's so-called complaints service is a bunch of foreigners pretending to be there, fabricating your complaint and then giving you a so-called answer.
There will be no change or compensation!
I've had similar problems before, but this time I can't stand it, it's too much!
I bought a new book in advance, and when it arrived, the cover and the back of the book were the opposite, so it was obvious that there was a quality problem, and so the book was sent to the customer blindly?
Nobody will contact you if you leave a bad review.
Excellent these years, worse and worse, there is no quality of service!
No more spending a dime on excellence.
The picture quality is really not acceptable
As an "ancient atlas," the book is unacceptable in its selection, layout, and printing of images, some of which are even mosaics, blurred beyond recognition.
Even if the book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small-scale illustration, it should be worthy of the large-scale second-hand documentation left by the ancestors in the catalogue!
What is the difference between using such images to assemble a book and not using any images at all?
I am sorry for that.
The text is not evaluated, and there are differences between the two schools.
Overall 2 stars.
When I was in high school, I read this book just because I was bored and wanted to play with it. I thought that I wouldn't fall in love with such a book, after all, I wasn't really attracted to the web texts at the beginning.
And then... I fell into the pit.
In the first part of the book, the main character is a young man who is in love with a young woman, but in the second part of the book, the main character is a young woman who is in love with a young man.
As for the competition part, it is written with a little bit of sadness (maybe my own sense of melancholy) about the changing times and the alternation of old and new.
It took me a lot of time in high school to read the whole book, but I just couldn't stop.
Full-time to character and emotional line of description is very impressive, some characters only occasionally carry, will also leave a very deep impact on people, such as more emphasis on character description Li Xu Huang Shu Tian Su Mu Orange have a large number of fans, and not in the writing center of the character such as Jiang Bo Tao Chu Yun Show and so on also very much liked, in an e-sports funny text did not let people find an extremely unpleasant character, this is a full-time success in character description.
And on the emotional line, full-time and the general web texts criticized the palace of 30,000,000,000 either beautiful or corrupt problems, the whole text of all the emotions, all have one thing in common is that they like to glorify the game, and mostly want to victory.
There is little conspiracy in small doses, and everyone looks so simple and cute.
This is perhaps why there are no annoying roles full-time.
The large number of full-time IPs is also due to this.
Aside from being a cultural phenomenon, Full Time is a good book.
How much he would really offer some warmth, a little touch.
This April, full-time to be animated.
In fact, want to buy this set of books for a long time, because the wallet is always not thick enough is not bad enough, and then when you want to buy it, you will find that the tb is just a fake rampant, in fact, full-time recently came out another version, cover picture I myself is quite like, but still intend to buy the old version, so I looked at Amazon, bought a set at once.
The following is a brief description of the situation of the goods.
The seal of the fourth volume is missing, but the book is new.
● The seventeenth volume was sealed but was opened, the texture of the book also felt strange no other hard.
The 23rd is the same as the 17th, but also harder than the 17th, but much older.
The publishers of individual books differ, as if the 23rd and 17th were the same publisher, and the others were different.
● Overall, I am satisfied, 24 is a big box, very satisfied.
The Lonely Little Lion
When I got the book, I thought it was going to be as simple as The Lost Corner, and it turned out to be a lot of words!
I read it three times before I finished reading it to my little friend, a little lion who can shoot, a little lion who loves to eat fruit juice and candy.
The scene of the lion eating the hunter is slightly uncomfortable, and the arrangement of being eaten by an animal is somewhat unacceptable to modern urban people.
In the end, the little lion, who had succeeded in human society, lost himself, and was no longer a complete lion or a complete man.
In the end, there was only the shadow of the little lion, and no one knew where he had gone.
Perhaps many years later, the image of this little lion will remain in the minds of her grown-up friends, recalled at an unexpected moment one day, perhaps touching or inspiring them.
Very good value for money.
1. I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but I've bought a lot of their books lately, because they're so strong, both in the choice of topics and in the production itself.
There are three editions of the work, the largest, like the Michelangelo Complete, measuring about 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the medium, about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and the smallest, a two-volume edition with a box.
Personally, I think it is acceptable, not only because it is cheap and more than 700 pages divided into two books, which are better read as a paperback, but also because, unlike Michelangelo's complete works, the paintings dominate, and the black-and-white manuscript by da Vinci takes up most of it. For a limited budget, non-professional art reader, this edition is the best value for money as an appreciation of paintings and manuscripts.
2, the explanation of the drawing part is great, with composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I do not know whether it is printing or book size, some shadows are too deep, can not see the details, a little regret.
3. Compared to Michelangelo's manuscript, Leonardo's manuscript is much richer in content.
The former is already a genius, while the latter is not a genius because of the breadth and depth of his achievements.
If before you could only experience half of Leonardo da Vinci by looking at his paintings, after reading the manuscript, you would be completely speechless.
Garbage, whoever buys it will regret it!
He never gives a bad review, this genuine rubbish, bought a waste of money God horse, give me a reason!
1. The time is wrong, suddenly it's January 1, time is zero.
2. Poor quality leather strap, not silicone, with a wrist allergic bubble.
3. Frequently can not connect to the phone.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. Sleep test does not show, time is 0.
6.Not waterproof.
7. Other.
Logistics is too slow.
It says it arrived on October 16th, but it arrived on October 21st.
Delivery is so bad, it's slow to buy stuff on Amazon, I didn't expect it to be so slow!
Overall satisfaction
Before the beginning was worried about the packaging of the camera, this time is good, there is an inflatable bag, the camera is three-dimensional, can also be registered on the website, shutter speed 0, the rest can only wait to test it.
The speed of delivery is quite fast, here to spit on the courier guy, valuable items are placed in the doorway, go fast, I can't open the box in front of him to inspect, it's really wordless.
The merchant before the shipment to do for the customer to think:)
The seller is more responsible, specifically calling to ask the screen size of the camera used, and really thinks about the customer.
Shipping is also fast.
The diamond film is also quite suitable and works.
The battery is not fully charged
The machine is really good, I wanted to ask how the first charge is not satisfied, the charging indicator light is always red
Currently, there is no official Amazon feedback channel, so you can only give feedback in the product review
1. On March 29, the book was purchased for $31 via pre-order, which indicated that it would be pushed to the device on March 31, when the book could not be previewed on the Amazon website (because it was not yet released);
2. On March 31, the book was pushed to the device, the content was empty, only kindly expect, and the e-book on Amazon was reduced to 18 yuan;
3. Repeated attempts during the two days to delete the blank book downloaded on the device and to synchronize again failed to access the electronic version of The Nature of Business containing the actual content, but it appears that a preview of the book is already available on the Amazon website.
I have a few thoughts for now.
1. the price issue is not really the most important, the key is now how to replace the blank book on the kindle with actual content of the book, not always download "please look forward"
2. Pre-ordered books should not be bought again, after all, in case you skip the ticket and download an empty book, the procedure seems very complicated;
3. Amazon should provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues, such as downloading and using e-books (work orders, online customer service, etc.).
Not very recommended to read
I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see it.
The book is less a collection of short stories than a collection of fragments of life about love.
The tone of the book is extremely calm, as calm as white boiling water, the use of words and phrases pursues simplicity to the extreme, and the plot is calm and quiet, like the streets in a summer afternoon.
Each short story is a silhouette of a short moment in ordinary life, without beginning or ending.
It was eventually compiled under the title What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.
I think that this collection of novels, and its title, as a form of performance art, the author wants to express that love is not only the sad and happy on the stage, the sea in the urban legend, and not just you and me, love is not only and should not be represented by the above, love is also life as water, dull and tasteless day after day, but also the helplessness of life, the escape of reality, the uncertainty of the future.
As you read this book, you may be reminded of quarreling couples around you, of the dull marriages of people you know, and of unpleasant relationships.
That’s why I don’t recommend it. From an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of the book are tasteless, and unless your life is full of turmoil or sweet as a candy castle, you’ll find it boring and uninteresting.
And, in terms of the depth of thought, the daily episodes do not open one’s eyes or expand one’s mind and horizon (unlike Marx’s Love in the Time of Cholera), and the brief fragments do not explore any questions, such as what mistakes led to the failure of love.
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don’t recommend reading the book. It doesn’t make much sense to read it.
The author &apos; s ideas are expressed more through technique and style than through narrative, which also contributes to the poor readability of the book.
It is suitable for rough reading, not for detailed reading.
The logic of the book is good, but the content is not rich enough.
Explained a lot of sales theory is what and why, but in how to do it is very weak, just pointed out the direction but did not give specific practice.
Also, the book feels like a piece of junk.
There are examples both domestic and foreign; both well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and well-known unknown people.
I wonder if the story was compiled for illustrative purposes, but it would have been more convincing if some of the author &apos; s personal experiences had been mentioned.
The name of the customer or the customer varies.
The title is still the customer, the body becomes the customer.
There are also problems with misspellings, missing punctuation, and incorrect numbering in e-books.
All in all, this book is a good choice as a theoretical introduction, but it is not very suitable for those who already work in sales and want to improve the level of sales.
A Quick Guide to Internet Finance
The book is shallow, it can be said that it is just an introductory course, which can help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but to understand in depth, you have to follow the tutorial, dig deeper yourself.
Moreover, the book was written earlier, and the content of the subsequent Weibo loan subsidy war to cultivate user habits was not mentioned, and today's third-party payment share is probably not as small as it was said in the book.
Many people now take their mobile phones with them when they go out to eat, and businesses have abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank leverage.
However, I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book, which shows that the author has at least many years of financial observation experience, and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so that he can write such a simple and understandable content.
It is easy to write in large letters, but it is difficult to write in simple and understandable terms.
I appreciate you, and I want you to know!
The first factor in determining a person &apos; s job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether the work is sufficiently valued and appreciated.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, after a person's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs -- the desire to be understood, acknowledged, and appreciated.
Indeed, for most Chinese, “love is hard to express,” and even love, gratitude, and appreciation are kept quietly in their hearts.
In this book, the author outlines five languages of appreciation: affirmative words, thoughtful moments, acts of service, thoughtful gifts, and physical touch.
I don't think it's important that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use them whenever and wherever you want to express appreciation and gratitude to those around you, whether it's family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the closer we are to someone, the more we need to show appreciation and gratitude, so that our lives become better.
By learning to appreciate, companies can also retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the number of resignations.
Thank you to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign ideas and world.
Because of the Chinese and Western cultural backgrounds, there are more or less differences between the languages, and it would certainly be more rewarding to have the opportunity to see the author &apos; s original version.
Thanks again to the authors and translators, and to the editors for their hard work!
Suspected counterfeit goods, please Amazon strict review
Super poor quality, packaging loose, no weight, even worse than roadside stall products, no gram weight, no barcode, ten bags of packaging is also loose and collapsed, completely not the characteristics of qualified products; is Amazon's worst shopping experience, has applied for a return; completely belongs to the quality issue; suggested that the merchants brighten their eyes, refuse low-quality goods; add: bought another heart-shaped print, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 rolls, plus a few contrasting photos, further verified the product's counterfeit, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, avoid economic losses and further moodiness!
Again, Amazon is expected to be meticulous about where its products come from.
A poor product that falls short of expectations
Advantages:
1. Big brand, cheap price.
Advantage 2: The motor and blades are Panasonic guaranteed, it is OK to use, but there is a gap with my expectations.
Disadvantages:
1. charging no indicator light, this is the most basic of your power instruction is saved, it is estimated that the purchase of 300 yuan product customer, in the eyes of Panasonic, also alms, no respect.
2. Strong smell. During charging, even after only 10 minutes of charging, you can smell the strong smell of burning plastic.
I tried it in the office for a day, and the whole room smelled like plastic.
Compared to the Philips that I used before at the same price, although it has one more blade, the quality of this Panasonic product really does not deserve the consumer.
Small packages
收到快递一看上面写着电商版就知道又掉坑里了,比超市买的小了好些,应该是M,跟商品介绍上面的图片包装不一样,所谓的新版吧.
Three stars is to blame yourself careless not to see clearly the specifications of goods, you sell M size e-commerce version I have no comment, you do not mean the right version is how many?
E-commerce is so clever that there is still time to go to the supermarket.
It's just a question of time.
I don't like the taste.
The kids don't like the taste of toothpaste, they say it's spicy every time, and maybe it's better to use another word, which is the only word in their vocabulary for the time being.
I bought it during the event, it's cheap, so I'm not embarrassed to give a bad review, four stars, but I won't buy it again.
Very well packaged.
The packaging is complete, with an inflatable bag inside, and there is no online review except for the bare appearance of a product.
The bottle also has a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging as described in the picture, the courier is also fast, it came the next day after taking the photo.
I don't know when I'll be back.
A horrible shopping experience
黑五的时候下的单，结果等了很久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，但是说要寄件方才能启动查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被错投给别人了，还有几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的
Wrong diagram.
I thought I could receive headphones like Figure 1, but unexpectedly received headphones like Figure 2, the image is not consistent, the left and right headphones sound size is different, what does it mean?
Although the name is the same, but still hope that everyone can pay attention, and also ask Amazon responsible for timely replacement of the correct map, thank you very much.
General Operating System
Used for a while, in general, the picture is good, feel no difference, is that the system makes people look confused, the startup time is obviously a little slow, and can not make a good setup, and the software is not to comment, the response speed is more average, compared to colleagues that is not an order of magnitude.
Look at the comments said very humane design, I did not find anywhere humane, the remote control is commonly used up and down left and right, the position of the return key design is really not daring to compliment.
So, let's just use it as a TV, plus a set-top box or something.
That's a huge deal.
That's a huge deal, 100-plus is now 99!
Amazon accumulated a lot of unreviewed orders, so I uniformly used a copy of a sentence as the content of the review.
If I were to rate this product with this sentence, it would be at least 85 or more.
I will not be lazy enough to copy and paste the reviews of poorer products, so that other consumers can use them as a reference when buying, and the merchants can improve the quality of their goods.
Low price, good line, no fever, that's all it takes!
Such a cheap line, but it should be to meet the hdmi certification standards, personal comparison of the second in the country autumn leaves these shit gadgets (the price is twice as expensive), the line is thick, soft, 7 meters transmission no noise, then low-priced line acknowledged think twice!
Good stuff, but Amazon's after-sales service is really bad compared to other sites.
After placing the order, I realized that I had made a mistake, but I could not cancel the order, and the online customer service page showed an error link and could not be contacted.
When the goods arrived, the courier called me, and I said that I did not want them. I tried to cancel the order, but it did not work. The courier took the goods back and told me to sign the receipt and apply for a return.
When I applied for a return, I was told that the food category could not be returned once it was signed, there was no way to call Amazon customer service, it was also said that it could not be returned once it was signed.
I have bought in the past on the policy of not being able to return goods, including milk, diaper pants, etc., contact customer service to return, and after opening the diaper pants taste too great contact customer service to return, to your Amazon can not.
Rules are dead, people are alive.
Tell me, either I take it myself, or the courier buys it for me. It's not easy to be a courier. Why should I make people pay for something they didn't buy?
Okay, I'm not going back, I'm taking it myself, but I have to give you one point for your service.
Don't waste your money.
First full of expectations to buy, think that the brand should not be far off, after receiving the packaging feels good, the head is not bad, but a box is basically soft, the appearance is not visible, to feel, eat in the mouth completely tasteless, pale and tasteless, biting the flesh a circle is dark yellow is broken that kind of, good and bad for sale, can eat less than one third, advise everyone not to buy, and not cheap, the quality is too bad!
Learn from this and never buy fruit from e-commerce again!
Where is the product counterfeit marking
The depth of the bottom corner of the bottle, should have been subjected to a strong impact to be caused, from the outer packaging bag, the degree of destruction feels heartbreaking, after all, the food packaging is too simple, and still belongs to the international purchase, and did not see any obvious counterfeit marking, opening the bottle is very easy, the key is a layer of honey in the lid directly from the inside, the opening is almost no stickiness, foreign products are all like this?
I was born in China and I don't understand.
It should be genuine, right?
This is the first time I buy overseas here, just to write down my doubts, maybe this is normal?
Pick-up service can be improved
I bought a total of 5 vouchers, at the time of withdrawal, the first appointment to withdraw 3, the result was only sent 2, after multiple communications only confirmed that it was leaked, promised to be re-issued; the second appointment, just in time for the rest day, the website and WeChat no hint that you need to make an appointment on a working day, causing unnecessary panic, recommends future improvement.
Very good shopping.
Something good!
Still more confident Amazon own things, now overseas purchase after it is convenient, buy back from abroad to logistics time than in the country is more than a few days, I have to say Amazon overseas purchase to domestic customs clearance capacity is still very strong, much faster than going transit, so now a lot of things are bought overseas to buy.
It is to be hoped that the quality and prices of domestic goods will be improved. Many things are domestically produced, but it is cheaper to go abroad and buy them than to buy them at home.
Garbage
When you see a package like this, ask yourself: Do you think it's trash on the side of the road?
Is it responsible to send a fragile plastic package in a plastic bag from so-called Germany?
I bought this product, the packaging is simple, without any measures to prevent breakage, just a simple plastic bag packaging, upon arrival, the package is completely deformed, and the items inside are broken.
If I just run into one of these, I recognize, bought a few are like this, to Amazon customer service, customer service said it can be returned, but shipping paid in advance, and then shipping in the form of a gift card returned to me.
I paid for the shipping in cash, and you gave me the gift card back. I have to buy your gift card myself, and I have to mail the product to the German warehouse myself.
And I've been saying to customer service, such a problem is whose responsibility, customer service but half a word is their responsibility, even half a word responsibility do not dare to bear, such after-sales service and what guarantee? In a word: recognize! But I guess my evaluation, Amazon will not give the opportunity to publish, directly back to delete!
Very good quality, 5 stars, poor logistics.
1, good quality, instant kill, moderate price, great value.
2, sturdy, sufficient material, weld point firm, proper surface treatment, good color.
3, logistics is hard, 3 under the order, 11 arrived.
4. I might have been happy if Amazon had not indicated February 7 as the expected delivery date.
5, but indicating the expected time of arrival amounts to giving a promise to the user, and it is very unpleasant for the user when the promise cannot be fulfilled.
6, if you do not have the assurance of giving a commitment, please do not make a commitment.
7, in fact, I am very concerned about the commitment made by the merchant.
8, so I scored low.
The gold thread will fade.
The effect is still there, but whether it is obvious, it depends on the individual, or psychological effects.
One thing that is not so good is the gold wire, which was designed to look good, but in fact, the gold wire will fade, and if you put it on the car, if you move it a few times, on the hand, and on the car, there will be some gold powder.
Hope the product can be improved.
This square, there is no decorative effect, so do not get involved in the gold wire, fall down in the car to get dirty car trouble.
It's in good condition, it's fast, it's in two packages, it's differently packed.
8 days speed is quite fast, but the 2 pieces divided into 2 packages, packaging is not the same, obviously one shockproof too much, thick cardboard, sealed with a layer of plastic, outer packaging is also easy to unpack, one like a domestic courier box, put a few buffer airbags is a matter of fact, feel a little complicated.
The mattress is very comfortable.
The 34cm mattress is not normally thick, it is not necessary to sleep directly on the mattress.
The quality is very good, both the front and the back are very soft, it is very comfortable to sleep on and you soon fall asleep.
The mattress arrived with some stains in two places because of the violent transport of the courier, the Yaran customer service was very responsible and very efficient in solving the problem.
It's not self-service. Amazon is shameless.
The page is clearly marked as self-service, but in fact it is distributed by the supplier. After-sales is the responsibility of the supplier, who should be contacted in case of problems.
If you want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been transmitted to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; if you want to return the goods, you have successfully applied for the return of the goods on Amazon, sorry, no one cares about you, you need to contact the supplier to return the goods yourself.
This is not a good idea.
Goods are not Amazon delivery, after-sales Amazon does not assume, customer service says "I'll help you contact the supplier", also claims to be self-employed, so shameless, naked no face, naked fraud to consumers!
A depressing experience
Before the filter cartridge purchased online, the filtration is good, 28 days after the end of more than a couple of days and the same no scale.
Since the quality of the things acquired in Amazon can, this time I thought to buy here, the first time in Amazon to buy a filter cartridge, feel not so good, not only early in the morning to start with limescale, and the filter cartridge has been used to the 28th day, will have suspended small black ink, I do not know is to continue to use, or directly thrown good, very depressing ~
It's not as good as it sounds.
Compared to the plug-in board I used before, the external work is normal, how the inside is not disassembled, but as described by the store, from the convenience of use, whether each independent unit is powered lacking display
The packaging was broken and the quality of the product had to be tested.
The outer packaging is severely damaged, the inner box seems to be new, but the instructions do not seem to be new, it was renovated in September, stocked, hopefully it will not be bad, please explain to Amazon why several customers mentioned that the packaging was broken, but you can be safe, thank you!
Overall good, a little bit of a problem
The first time to buy a water filter kettle, read a few reviews, feel LAICA's higher value for money to choose this, the receipt of goods according to the instructions installed the filter cartridge, tried it, feels overall good, but when pouring water as if the raw water will be mixed from the mouth of the kettle with the treated water (the original water tank seal is not too tight).
When you use it, be sure to wait until all the water is filtered before pouring it out!
The picture is incomplete
The picture does not show the side details, the side details are not consistent with the style of the subject, there is a big difference, that's one; the beads are Thai, there is no indication of origin, that's two; there is no indication of texture, that's three; when I bought it in the UK, it was clear that each item had a box, here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product logo on the beads, I can't judge whether it's real or fake.
Be careful when buying, especially when it comes from Hong Kong.
Amazon Customer Service
The order was placed two days ago, received today and found a drop of 40 bucks, took a lot of time to find customer service, customer service said that it could not compensate for the difference, can rebuy and return the goods.
This customer experience and service is 10,000 times better than anything else.
Okay, as a beginner, it's worth trying.
It's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert, and it's the first time I've ever been to a concert.
It's good stuff.
The thing is really good, sent his girlfriend, but at noon I was not in Canada Post somewhat unpleasant, the logistics company directly put the mail deposit and did not send a copy of the verification text message to me, caused me to run twice.
But the baby is really good.
Worth buying
The little monkey is cute, Amazon's preferential power is so great, Zhou Zhisheng's official website sends directly, the order was placed the night before, this afternoon I received it, so fast.
The postman is also very responsible.
Zane!
Confession of a customer
1 When you receive such a defective item, Amazon Customer Service tells you not to hurry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 In the meantime, you contact the customer service staff, who will tell you that the matter will be dealt with by a commissioner, who will inform you of the outcome.
You never contact the commissioner on your own initiative, you don &apos; t know her work number, there is no hotline, so you can &apos; t contact her, only she can contact you.
3 The tragedy was that after waiting almost three days, the Commissioner contacted me, and my mobile phone was off for a while, so I did not receive the Commissioner &apos; s call.
I waited for 2 hours and did not get a call from the commissioner, during which I took the initiative to contact Amazon customer service and emailed the customer service to call me back.
4 Nearly three days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon will do to me when they receive this defective coffee machine!
5 There are no problems with the goods on Amazon in the United States, which is a good way to shop overseas, but it is a far cry from the service provided to America and Asia.
6 For me, I can only continue to wait...
Flat Bottomed Girls
Because see the review is very good, all of this pot is very hopeful, when I got it, I like it very much, very light, but when I open the pot, I found the problem, the bottom of the pot is not flat, the middle protrudes, the edge is dented, the oil runs to the edge, specially bought to open the pot big fat meat fried out a lot of oil can not cover the central region, the paste, open the pot can not open, this construction is estimated to be unable to normally cook food.
I don't know if I was unlucky or not, but I got a pot with an uneven bottom. Fortunately, Amazon offered a one-month return policy, so I decided to return it.
I wiped the pot clean and retired for half a day.
Good product design requires a matching manufacturing process
This is a product with a very simple design.
For the shape of the cube, the designers treated the top as a slightly curved surface.
It should have been a very smooth line.
Unfortunately, the final result could not be achieved.
Because the top has two parts, the front is the control panel and the rear is the top cover of the water tank.
The curvature of the top cover and the curvature of the control panel did not match, and a height difference of up to about 2 mm appeared after assembly.
Although it looks like a small gap.
But it can be said to destroy the whole sense of design.
It's a little painful for the product designer.
Looking beautiful product managers do not have the ability to create such a level of products.
(Of course, the feedback of the after-sales lady can not be too high, but when I heard the after-sales said that all the individuals of this product are like this, not only I bought this problem, her disbelief and honestly burdened emotions make me understand that the beauty can not be too high) 2019-7-7 water pump malfunction output is small, it has been repaired for the second time, and it was broken two weeks after the first repair.
It's a good deal, but it's a bad deal on Amazon.
A week after the birth of the baby bought, super warm.
The outside of the pot does not touch a trace of heat, which means that it can effectively protect the temperature from spreading without fear of burning people.
After a night in the air-conditioned room can still keep a very high temperature.
Amazon said that the anniversary 320 great deals, later found that everyone 249,289,299 have, instantly a feeling of being deceived, but to the supermarket to compare it still more than the same price range of various brands more economical, in the future out can carry with the car.
Vitamix 6300
It has been waiting for a long time, seeing US $ 6300 discount, Central Asia overseas purchase at the same price, hurry up.
September 2nd order, expected arrival was 21, the result of 12 arrived, almost 10 days in advance, the speed is really fast!
The box is small, directly using the original packaging of Vitamix, Amazon is not afraid of floating across the sea broke!
The machine looks pretty new, with all the accessories, but the cups on the base shake so badly that I'm afraid the cups will fly out of the machine!
I asked a friend with a 5200, and he described it as not as loose as mine.
I'm tired of seeing random recipes in English, and I can't find a Chinese version on the web, which is a hassle!
After receiving the goods in a hurry to buy a transformer, estimated three days to be here, and then fold well!
Too small, no umbrella, average material.
It's not a big deal!
The second Totes, 1. This does not have an umbrella 2. umbrella handle material normal 3. clearly writes Large, in fact, is a convenient umbrella for one person, two people estimated enough to choke.
Instead, I bought the one I bought in America three people can use without stress.
I don't feel so good.
First of all, the box is not very sturdy, with a click is deformed, secondly, the design of the back to prevent the box surface of the ABS scratch and does not work, again, the box inside is a piece of cloth wrapped, the pull rod is prominent.. etc., various dissatisfaction, the last zipper a little uneven.
PS: The wheels feel really good.
It's okay.
Advantages: This shoulder bag is sophisticated and looks durable.
Disadvantages: The QR code on the card can not be scanned (what the hell), 15.6-inch laptop can not be placed (a little longer can not do), this shoulder bag zipper can be locked, but does not provide a lock for the buyer, not the best service.
I don't know if it's leather.
The overall feeling is good, not knowing whether it is leather, so you can not blindly evaluate.
Documents of A4 size can be stored, but boxes of more than 80 pages, which are too thick and hard (and cannot be deformed), are not expected to fit.
The bag is very soft, inside the inner pocket separation is more humanized, it is quite good.
It's just that I got this one with a little sandy eye on the bottom, I don't know if it's my bad manners or something.
I'm lazy to go back and forth.
It's worth it.
ForRoyal Worldwide Camera Back Strap SLR Back Strap
The back strap is designed more scientifically, hanging on the shoulders, practical, and the chest is fixed and protected by a soft material, not like other fast guns with screws attached to the bottom of the camera, and it is easy to take off the camera.
Garbage after sales
I bought a piano a month and a half ago, missing a part, notified Amazon, then gave me the after-sales phone, after several communications, the parts are now confiscated, ask what efficiency!
Estimated after maintenance problems more troublesome, look forward to good after-sales friends or a detour, too much trouble!
Slightly defective, good tone.
The head is defective, a horn is missing, it feels like a scrap, and there is no gift, but the price is already good, and the tone of the piano is also good.
All right, first page.
I've been using it for a long time and it's great.
The work is not as perfect as expected.
When I bought it for the first time, something was wrong, all the lights were blinking and it could not be used.
He requested a replacement, but the goods had been in Shanghai for three days and had not yet been delivered.
He didn't answer the phone.
The courier stated that that was the only contact they had.
Amazon can't find a place to complain.
There was no request, and in the event of a delay in delivery, an inexplicable text message was sent, stating that the delivery was delayed at my request.
What do you mean by that?
Anyway, the extremely bad shopping experience began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
I don't think I'll get it today.
Label adhesion too poor, not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is convenient, but the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not coated; and the stickiness of the label is poor, it is not good at all for cable labels, it is very easy to fall off, friends who buy it to organize cables need to pay attention.
The pen was fine, but the packaging was too simple, just a paper box, without any protection, and the box containing the pen was glued with a large piece of transparent glue, which, when torn off, was all on the box.
It was a very disappointing shopping experience.
But the pen is fine.
Hope to improve the packaging in the future!
It's not as good as the 925-25 when it comes to writing.
First praise daily express, aviation parts, super fast, service attitude is also very good!
一直在用 925-25, 很棒, 刚收到 925-85, 笔的质量没的说, 样式也很漂亮, 为什么给四星是因为笔有点重, 不适合快速写字, 笔帽调节铅芯长度处有点抖动, 个人意见: 925-25要比 85更顺手.
So it turns into Amazon loyalty powder.
They were bought at a super-discounted price, and as a result the children did not like to read with a pencil.
Unsealed, tried to apply for a return, it was free to pick up at home.
It's cool.
It does not advocate returns, but such a service, in China only this one.
Hope not to be abused.
After that, all the books were transferred to this location and bought here.
The headphones are distorted, and there's noise.
I don't know if it's my ears that have a problem, or if the headphones are really not as good as they used to be.
I bought a blue one two years ago at eBay, sound quality is good, no noise, bass is good, after more than two years of use, I'm going to buy another one (urbeats), after all, it feels good.
I saw a purple one, and it was pretty. I bought this one today, and when I opened it, it sounded strange. It was loud and quiet at the same time.
At first I thought it was because of the sound effect of the song did not think much, but then listened to half a day I found this problem is very serious, not only distortion, bass effect is not my earlier that sounded better, and some noise, is only I bought this purple has this phenomenon? or now the headphone manufacturing process really can't do it?
Quite poor evaluation, very disappointing.
"I'll be back tomorrow," he said.
It's not good.
This type of AV amplifier is complex, roughly crafted, and generates a lot of heat.
The sound will take some time to review again!
August 14 just got the German version of the DN1080.
1. The front panel and knobs are made of plastic.
2. backboard audio input jack, speaker output terminal is bad, just find a 1000-2000 CD player is much better than this.
3. The top cover is thin, my transformer that side also dented, had to open the box by hand to recover, the top cover and the front panel together loose.
4. The entire center of gravity of the machine is inclined towards the end of the transformer, and it is very easy to move.
It feels like a Sony entry-level machine, just do it, produced in Malaysia.
It feels like Sony to put in China subcontractors are much better than Pony.
5.Machine heat, watching movies with two voices about 2 hours right top cover with the hand to touch a 40-50 ℃, do not know whether the transformer too much heat.
Now I use switched-mode power supplies, and this stupid transformer weighs about 4 kg.
Sony should have used a quiet, active cooling fan inside the machine, instead of a large aluminum heat sink on a tube.

I haven't opened it.
The battery is in use.
I'd like to dissect it and see what's in it.
If you think about it later, if you are disappointed after disassembly, it would be wrong to spend so much money; if you are satisfied after disassembly, it would be difficult to reassemble, and it would not be cool to use.
Forget it, even if Sony uses good batteries.
As for the detailed specifications of the power, the average person would be disheartened to see.
I'm fine, I've worked in a cell phone factory for a long time, and apart from not knowing circuits, I'm half a battery engineer, so I can handle it.
Unexpected happiness
I didn't know what to expect until I opened the box!
Finally, when I touch the headphone cord, it feels particularly soft, the quality is so good, I can't wait to plug it into my phone to open QQ music.
I was amazed that the sound was surround 3D!
I asked in the physical store, about 30, but definitely not the brand of victory, is mixed, so say this victory although 27 blocks, but the value for money is absolutely worth owning!
The worst online shopping experience
After placing the order on 28 September, the system indicated that the goods had been shipped, but they had not arrived until 12 October.
When the status of the order was checked on Amazon, the seller did not provide a tracking number and it was not possible to find out where the order was.
An e-mail was sent to the seller asking if it could provide the consignment note number, but no reply was received after two days.
In desperation, I called Amazon customer service, the customer service told the seller's phone number, I called the store again, after a few calls, the phone was connected, and was told that the courier lost the package, can immediately resend me one.
Although I was particularly angry, because I needed the computer urgently, I did not say much to the seller, as long as he sent it to me immediately.
As a result, the next day I called and asked if it was shipped.
The seller said not yet, it will be sent in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, the seller said he would send it after 5:00 or 6:00 p.m., and when I called at 7:00 p.m., no one answered the phone.
On the third morning, I called again, asking if the goods had been shipped.
Can you give me the order number?
The seller said that it had not been delivered and told me that if I was in a hurry, I could order it from another place and if I could wait, it would be delivered in the afternoon.
No way, ordering from another place will take a long time.
The seller is very friendly and helpful.
Finally, after countless telephone follow-ups, I received the computer on 16 October.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because I bought it for someone else, I'll add comments later.
Just bought half a year not used a few times, now has bad contact, ask can be repaired?
I haven't used it a few times since I bought it because I have a desktop computer.
Just take a few times in the business fashion bag.
Recently, it has been found that when plugged into a power source, it does not charge and requires a few hand movements to the left and right of the charger and cord connections in order to charge.
I suspect it's bad contact at the interface, I don't know if it can be repaired now?
Strongly recommend Amazon to turn off EMS!
Goods five stars, logistics one star, average three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon to send EMS, the industry recognized as unreliable, well, computers are also valuable items!
The post-purchase order indicated that delivery was expected on the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four or five days to ship from Xiamen to Fuzhou?
22 in the morning to check the logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou, ready to open the heart to receive the goods, as a result, in the evening in the confiscation of any telephone, text message, a check logistics, it was signed at noon, and also showed the signature!
I was shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
I don't believe in life!
"I'm going to take it back."
The specific reason is simply because the courier guy turned the two numbers upside down, and it's good that the package wasn't lost.
I strongly recommend that Amazon stop using EMS, and I will not buy anything from Amazon if it uses EMS in the future.
It's good.
First of all, I just bought a few days to discover the reduction, bad reviews, this is still good, value for money, cpu and graphics card enough to cope with the mainstream online games and a considerable part of the large single machine, heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a little leaking (ips screen common disease), sound quality is not very good, hard drive is not good (recommended to spend a little money to add a solid state), yesterday took it to the sale after testing the hardware, no problems, its own win8.1 not very good, recommended upgrade to 10, the seller ships very quickly, various questions answered very quickly, received the computer the next day the invoice arrived, good, unfortunately what gifts are not.
(By the way, buy a keyboard foil certainly do not go to a shop called E-cool digital center buy, delivery slow, poor quality, the product is not returned or replaced, the boss is full of bad words, especially exposed)
It's good. The platform bureaucrats are still there.
The quality of the hard drive is very good, absolutely high value for money, cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, not in a hurry to use and can endure the logistics absolutely recommended purchase.
But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still, no improvement from a few years ago when I swore absolutely not use, you can never find out the actual logistics, information is always a few weeks later sent, never can complain, that's how bureaucratic!
The goods received in a few days, logistics information is still 10 days, you will receive the goods!
Logistics is not careful
It was delivered as it was, not only flattened, but the electrical packaging was also open, and I do not know if it was repackaged.
FYI
I haven't tried it yet, always trusting Philips, hoping the battery life is longer than other brands.
It may be that it is a common disease in the water, and there is no warranty.
Depressed!
Now wrap it in plastic wrap and continue to use it, I don't know how long it will last?
I bought it from someone else.
"It's not that I don't like you," he said, "but I don't like the way you look at me now.
When I received the sealing tape condition looks very wrong, like unpacking, hurry up to take a picture, it turned out to tear it open, after opening the inside of the cardboard is damaged, worried that someone else returned, not to the anniversary day to hurry up to my husband to try it, the result is that the machine has no power, luckily there is no slag in the knife, it is not a long way to go back!
Good or bad or short-term will not have any problem is unknown, as the previous evaluation, when the shortage of things sent really not reliable!
The feeling of the experience to the upper level
It's a top-of-the-line electric toothbrush, with a variety of cleaning modes, but few people will switch between them every day.
I've been using it for six months now, no problems, brushing every day for about a week or so.
The brush head accessories buy the same cheap on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use, except for changing the colors, other seemingly compatible problems are the reason for the overseas version?
I want to learn the Dafa.
Very good value for money
It has been used 3-4 times.
1, good packaging.
2, very simple to use, easy to clean.
3, completely can DIY haircut, save money.
All in all, a very successful purchase.
It's fake.
The last time I bought two packages, it turned out to be two different versions, the word on the top left corner of the package was green, as a result, one package was not, it was white word, as a result, cat cat ate and pulled his stomach.
I'm not sure if Amazon's source is fake, or if the package was opened by an employee at the time of shipment.
I'll buy it again, and if it's still fake, I'll take your people to task.
It's a joke!
Amazon picture is oblique, the result to send me is horizontal, this is not a scammer?
It's working.
Cats like to eat, that's the point.
And it does work.
Tight, narrow, bound feet, grinding back of feet.
Not recommended.
1.UN is the most comfortable series of Clarks, unfortunately this is too bad.
Addendum: Today compared to the previous UN series shoe pads (shoes thrown pad keep it), the material is not much different than before, less elastic than before, breathability is not as before, is fake soft.
2. The back of my feet is not high, and the... is about 3 cm to the front at the highest point of the back of my feet.
3. Three pairs of Clarks shoes were purchased overseas, but only one pair fit.
I was so scared I deleted all of my favorites.
I'm going to go back and try it again.
Good filling, poor quality control.
First, it is certain that Prime overseas purchases are strong, the single 6 under the number 31 received.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.
Shoe size slightly larger, 25 feet 10.5 wide shoe 7.5W, slightly loose on the foot, but usually like to wear a little loose, a pair of shoe pads just right.
Secondly, this shoe quality control really dare not compliment, a shoe sole adhesive damaged, the other shoe has various scratches and a needle eye, shoe and sole joint adhesive strip misplaced, clearly displayed in the second fill!
A little regret!
Do the activity 280 blocks bought, the price to buy Arthurs quite reasonable, of course, see the reviews and lower prices.
Now let's talk about the shoes, the advantages: the shoes are light, comfortable to run, and fits the foot, not loose and crumbling.
It's high-quality but the drawbacks are obvious: I normally wear 40 shoes, this time I bought 40.5, and the front of the shoe is about a thumb away, but that doesn't matter.
The shoe is "narrow" and feels tight, although there is space in the front.
Also, the breathability of the shoes may not be very good, and the feet feel very hot when wearing them now.
Press the foot back.
First of all, the shoes are well made and worth the price.
My feet are very standard, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, Amazon Love Walk also bought a few pairs, never appeared to fit, but this pair I refer to the comments, buy a large uk7, on the foot because a larger length is obviously longer, but because the shoe pad is too thick, or the foot back pressure is strong, and the hiking shoes are very hard, causing the foot very uncomfortable.
It's not recommended if your feet aren't particularly thin.
If you have to buy, change the shoe pads can also solve, but the original shoe pads look very high-end, it is not a pity.
Very perfect shopping!
Very satisfied, very much like, Amazon overseas purchase is undoubtedly genuine, quality is very good, good value, buy confident, after-sales service is very attentive, customer service is very kind and polite, deal with problems patiently and efficiently, perfectly solve the care concerns, the accompanying express delivery at home is very convenient and secure, the delivery master thinks about the customer, every time will be reminded in time to pick up the goods from the express cabinet, thank Amazon to provide customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In short, the whole family loves to shop overseas on Amazon!
Absolutely bad review!
It's a great way to start the day.
Be careful when buying electronics on Amazon in the future.
It's been a long time, but I'm still here.
I bought it last minute in the winter, less than 200, and kept it at home for a few months.
In the spring, when it was to be used, it was found that it could not be connected to the wristband in any way, both the instructions for the devices indicated that they supported each other, and later it was found that it should be a problem with the heart rate belt, because finding other devices could not be connected.
They called Amazon and told me to contact the agent, who told me to send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After nearly half a month, the stuff was sent back in the same way, even the courier box was the same one I used when I sent it!
No response and no acknowledgement and no test report!
Tell me if it's good or bad!
I called and asked, and they said that it was good to send it back because it meant that there was no problem with the equipment.
But I still couldn't connect, and the agency replied, "That's none of your business."
I'm sorry, I'm lazy to be broken by you for a 200-dollar thing.
Serious non-conformity.
It's not the end of the world.
The headband material is very good.
Much better than Nike.
Breathability is also good.
It's just the hat in front.
Very thin.
Are you coming for fun?
The sun was shining.
Not returned because it works well as a headband.
The sun is shining, but it's not sunny.
But it's different from other headband styles.
Keep it.
The quality of the goods is good, Amazon lacks contractual spirit, and the delivery man is good.
I require delivery on Saturdays and Sundays!
Amazon's policy is not to deliver on Saturdays and Sundays.
Damn it, driving 200 kilometers from the country to pick it up!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery man was very active and enthusiastic.
Give me a compliment!
Goods, just try it, it's good.
But I haven't bought similar goods before, so I can't compare prices!
Size Logistics
The work can, is too slow logistics, the previous shoes what is DHL, this time Apex really... in the country bought a lot of UA, the price is not low, feels like doing higher than NIKE ADIDAS class?
It's all the same, so it's sea shopping.
Size: I am 176CM tall, 68KG, my shoulder width normal clothes are 180, buy M, slightly longer, the other wears just right, I see there is a recommended size S, is the body so thin? or like tight? I think the hat shirt is still loose better.
It's just the right size.
Chest 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, before buying the customer service was told to buy xxl, then looked at the comments decided to get L, after receiving the goods found the right size, almost got trapped.
The price of double eleven is more expensive than black five.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
Affordable goods are a problem!
Ordered on the 18th, received on the 25th, snail speed from Guangzhou to Beijing!
I bought the Z-affordable goods, the instructions informed scratches, but after receiving the goods found missing 4 screws and nuts!
The child does not want to return the goods, thinking that the problem is not big, but accessories such as small parts, the child's grandfather ran several hardware stores in the vicinity did not buy!
Grandpa stuck it in the end!
Looks like you won't be able to buy Z-affordable goods anymore!
Toy processing quality is not good
Most of the screw holes are not aligned, the screw is very hard, can see the processing quality is not good, and I do not know how long you can play, because it is something promised to the child, so it does not go back.
Other reviews say it's easy to install, is this the only one I bought that has a problem?
Very average.
Is it my bad luck?
The packaging is too old; the workmanship is mediocre; the music is one and only eight seconds long and then repeated over and over again; the movements are shaking the head and moving forward without any change.
Not worth the price.
I don't think it's a good idea.
The quality of the toys is good. Let's talk about the packaging.
Yesterday, I received a parcel from Amazon, marked EMS delivery, and finally delivered by TianKat. How many turns did it take? Amazon and TianKat have a good relationship.
And about the packaging, it is wrapped in several layers of plastic film, there is not even a plastic bubble wrap, open it, all the parts are placed in an empty box, good quality toys, no broken parts, is much smaller than expected, because it is not with batteries, often pushed off the track, feel the gap on both sides of the track too large, unreasonable design.
It's good quality. It's fun.
It is fun, the components are very precise, fine workmanship, quality is almost the same as Lego, and the price is very favorable when doing activities.
The process of assembling was interesting. I was assembling and my five-year-old son was playing.
He laughed and laughed and laughed and probably will continue to buy this brand of toys in the future.
It's new. It's a good deal.
I bought it for Christmas, it was 150 bucks more expensive, but the shipping is a little slower now.
It's still good, it's still new.
Built-in pickup truck.
Then connect the goblin ball words will send a dream.
Playing is good, than ps4, high portability.
I already bought Zelda, I'm waiting for the game, I'll try again.
Producing bad goods, selling bad goods, resulting in bad service, bought six watches for children, one of which the numbers showed incomplete, the six pieces did not match the time, the difference of more than ten hours.
I contacted the manufacturer and asked if the time was checked when the watch was delivered to the warehouse. They replied that it was. If it was, then why was the time so different? It must be that the watch was not accurate. Simply put, it was a merchandise product.
I contacted the seller, the seller gave a lot of reasons, even complained that I should not have bought their stuff, such a product, such a seller, such an after-sales service, who dares to buy stuff on Amazon in the future.
In any case, I recommend not to buy anything from this seller, and if you do, it will be rubbish.
Amazon Shipping Problems
Inspection upon receipt revealed:
1, the table packaging severely damaged.
2, the table instruction book has a serious use of wrinkles.
3, the table does not go, the table lamp charging is not used, can not adjust the time.
4, separately contact Amazon customer service, can only be mailed to the United States, at their own expense, then replenish the postage.
5, 2 points reason is customer service is good.
I can only say that it fits.
The time is not very accurate, faster by about a second a day, and after only a few months it is almost two minutes faster.
I used to use a piece of West Iron City, I feel like one or two years will not be a few seconds.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, the timekeeping function is a bit of chicken rib, basically useless, occasionally mistakenly touch into the timekeeping mode.
Solar Sports Watches
Advantages: Solar charging, no need to worry about replacing batteries, world time, multiple alarms and full-time reminders.
Disadvantages: The mirror surface is easily scratched and dusted.
Value for money: the domestic price is generally between 220-300, overseas purchase more than 180 (it takes about 1 week).
Very satisfied.
It must be genuine, go to the store to inspect the goods, the appearance of the watch is beautiful, fine workmanship, enough material, plus it is imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight, those three or four hundred so-called mechanical watches can not compare, this is the real value of the goods.
The watch is very accurate, the error is completely within the acceptable range, the watch packaging has a jewel identification certificate, the 12 characters on the dial are real diamonds, it is very suitable to wear it yourself, and it is also very respectable to give it as a gift.
Bentley watches are really good.
Experience the worst shopping ever
On the night of September 23rd, my wife's phone broke, and I ordered an 8p from Amazon, which was available but not self-service and without a surcharge (in my heart), because the delivery was slower than the self-service, the system showed that the delivery was expected at the latest on September 27th.
My wife did not use the phone to die, the next day at 6 o'clock in the morning called me to think of a way, then went to Kyoto to see 256G goods can be delivered on the same day, just to immediately order another one.
I bought a new one and decided to cancel my Amazon order immediately.
Since the order was placed at midnight, it was impossible to collect the parcel in the morning. At 7 a.m., I called the customer service to cancel the order. The customer service replied that the order had been cancelled and that I should wait for a text message.
Well, I waited patiently, at noon on the phone look, the order is still in the state is still unshipped, immediately contact customer service request to cancel the order quickly, customer service response has been operating OK.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon on the phone to see the order is still there, there is no way but to contact customer service again to clearly inform the third call, please cancel the order and notify the seller must not ship!
At my request, the customer service contacted the seller immediately and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and that I should wait until he was familiar with it before cancelling the order.
But clearly tell me the seller already knows, absolutely will not ship please rest assured.
When I looked at my order on Monday and saw that it had been shipped, I was speechless.
As it was not possible to contact the seller directly, it was necessary to call the customer service again.
It's not that I don't like it, it's just that I don't like the way it's done.
The order is still in a rejected shipment status and is being prepared for re-shipment!
Wouldn’t Amazon follow suit?
The seller company anyway and collected the money does not follow up and it does not matter.
In summary, there will be no prepayment for large items in the future, it looks too troublesome.
It's gorgeous.
A long time ago looked at this camera, but because in addition to the price, there are some other reasons, so did not buy, this time because of free shipping, the price is also good so I bought.
After buying the other is no problem, it is in the software connection, how can not connect, my home is TP router, checked online after finding many people have this problem, made more than two hours, various changes to the router settings, finally I use 360WIFI as a medium to get it done, during the call to Xiaomi customer service, they have no solution to this problem, directly let me contact Amazon for after-sales.
Another point worth noting is that I saw on the web user comments that this camera supports memory cards of at least 8G, smaller storage capacity is not recognized, I hope you pay attention to this.
It feels good to use, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is poor, the machine has a certain degree of heat, always on, feel this level of heat is a bit unacceptable.
Summarizing the above, the product has many shortcomings, I hope everyone to be careful when buying.
The reason why I give it 3 stars is because I bought it with my first love in life, we were together for almost 3 years, and then she left me last year, until now.
The reason why I give it 3 stars is because I bought it with my first love in life, and now I don't know how much I've used it, maybe I threw it away!
I have been with her for almost three years, and this is how she left me last year. As soon as I think of her, it hurts my heart to leave this world. The first woman in my life has brought me shadows and pain for a lifetime, and so far I have not been able to get out of it.
When I bought this phone, think of the two of the feeling at that time, and can still share the suffering, but now it is unbearable to look back, perhaps life is like that, some people do not want to meet for a lifetime, some things do not want to know for a lifetime, but what is the way?
I have never had to spend more than $2,000 on a cell phone, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate. It's good for one person, but one day, when she changes her mind, all the promises of the mountains and the sea will disappear.
Boutique in the country product brand
Huawei is a boutique in the national goods.
Low-profile CEOs and firms rely on technology and quality to win customers, in contrast to today’s business culture, which relies on advertising to increase visibility!
A weak company would not be able to do that, and would not dare to do it!
That's why I chose Huawei.
I bought it for more than half a year, it feels good, very good.
The reason why I didn't give it full marks is because once when I was using it for offline navigation, there was a misdirection phenomenon, I didn't find out the reason in the end, other times it was good.
And its online input well the destination, after searching automatically design the route, leaving the wifi departure after, it automatically offline navigation function is very practical, do not run traffic, it directly talk to the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation, very good!
Sony Dafa is good
Sony's low-end, the design is still perfect, and cheap, the screen is big enough, the range of a level of bar, suitable for the elderly.
A long time has passed, but the machine is still fine.
But since my Z2 was decommissioned, it also served its purpose.
