GB 18030 - 2022
4-character idiom
4.1 Overview
The characters included in this document are encoded in single bytes, two bytes, or four bytes.
The single-byte part includes all 128 characters from GB/T 11383 from 0x00 to 0x7F in 1989.
4.3 Double-byte part
The double-byte part includes all graphic characters from GB/T 2312 of 1980, the CJK unified Chinese characters from GB/T 13000, and some graphic characters.
The double-byte characters are according to the rules in Appendix A.
In particular, the graphical, code position, and functional descriptions of ideographic characters should comply with the requirements specified in Appendix B.
Note: GB/T 13000 unifies the coding of Chinese characters used in China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, and other countries and regions.
Characters with unique abstract forms in Chinese are assigned unique code positions; characters with the same abstract forms but different sources are assigned shared code positions.
After being encoded, Chinese characters are called CJK Unified Ideographs, where CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea.
4.4 Four-byte part
The four-byte part includes the characters in GB/T 13000 other than the double-byte characters listed above, as well as the 66 CJK unified Han characters (9FA6 to 9FEF, excluding the 8 characters from 9FB4 to 9FBB), the CJK unified Han characters supplementary A, the CJK unified Han characters supplementary BCJK, the CJK unified Han characters supplementary C, the CJK unified Han characters supplementary DCJK, the CJK unified Han characters supplementary F, and the characters of minority languages that have already been encoded in GB/T 13000.
The four-byte part of the characters is according to Appendix C.
5 Overall Structure
Any number preceded by 0x in the main text is expressed in hexadecimal, while any number not preceded by 0x is expressed in decimal.
All codes in the appendix are expressed in hexadecimal, while other numbers are expressed in decimal.
The single-byte part uses the code structure of GB/T 11383-1989, using code bits 0x00~0x7F.
The double-byte gong part uses two eight-bit binary strings to represent one character, with the first byte code position ranging from 0x81 to 0xFE, and the second byte code position ranging from 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE.
The four-byte part uses GB/T 11383-1989, which was not adopted, as the suffix for the expansion of the double-byte encoding, with the code range of 0x81308130 to 0xFE39FE39.
The first four-byte character code range is 0x81 to 0xFE; the second four-byte character code range is 0x30 to 0x39; the third four-byte character code range is 0x81 to 0xFE; and the fourth four-byte character code range is 0x30 to 0x39. That is: 0x81308130 to 0x81308139; 0x81308230 to 0x81308239; 0x8130FEFE30 to 0x8130FE39; 0x81318130 to 0x81318139; Oo2douolag0c "0URo23061393 0xFE39FE30 to 0xFE39FE39.
The overall structure and bit range allocation are shown in Figure 1 and Table 1.

The content of this page is excerpted from the complete documentation of the GNU C compiler, and is limited to the meaning of the interpretation options.
Unless someone voluntarily maintains them, the EURo files and Info files are authoritative documents.
If there is a conflict between the manual page and the software, please check Info.
If we find that the content of this page becomes obviously confusing and complaints arise because it is outdated, we stop publishing it. There is no other option, such as updating the Info file and the man page at the same time, because we don't have time to maintain Gnu cc otherwise. The GNU project considers the man page to be an outdated product, and believes that time should be spent elsewhere.
For complete and up-to-date documentation, please refer to the Info file gee or Using and Porting GNU CC (for version 2.0) (ft&/HAIZE#H GNU CC 2.0), both of which are from the Texinfo source file gee.texinfo.
The C and C++ compilers are integrated, and they both process one or more of the four steps of input files: preprocessing, Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The extension name identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the extension name controls the default setting:
gcc considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C file and sets the C-style connection.
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C++ file and sets the C++ format for the connection.
The suffix of the original file name indicates the language type and subsequent operations:
.c C source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
C, C++, source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc is a C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, and assembly
CXX C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, and assembly
.m Objective-C source code; preprocessing, compilation, and assembly
.i a preprocessed C file; compile and assemble
.ii Preprocessed C++ files; compilation, assembly
.s is the source code of the assembly language; assembly
Assembler language source program; preprocessing, assembling
.h preprocessor files; they are usually not displayed in the command line along with other subsequent files that are passed to the linker (Linker). They typically include:
.0 Object file (Target file)
.a is an archive file
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process), connecting is always the final step.
During the linking stage, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognizable file names (including the specified .o H header file and .a library file) are passed to the linker options in the order specified on the command line.
The options must be given separately: de is completely different from -d -r.
Most "-E" and "-W" options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Only formats that are not the default are listed here.
The following is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in the following chapters.
Code Generation Option
Overall option
It explicitly specifies the language of the input file to be language (rather than the default selection based on the file name after the extension).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next -x language option is encountered.
It omits any explicit language specification, so the RE AS E ` -x' option for processing files based on the file name suffix applies.
If you only operate on a subset of the four stages (preprocessing, compilation, assembly, linking), you can use the -x option (or filename followed by Ah) to tell geo where to start, and the ~-c, -s, or -E options to tell geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (e.g., -x cpp-output -E) {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI by default, GCC creates .o files from source files by appending .ec file names to the source file names. You can use the -o option to select other names. GCC ignores anything after the -ec option that it cannot recognize as an input file -S F.
The target file.
After compilation, it stops and does not perform assembly.
Using pipes instead of temporary files at different stages of the compilation process, because the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from pipes, the GNU assembler does not have this problem. The assembler can accept "dialects" of C that support ANSI-standard C programs.
This will close certain features of GNU Cc that are incompatible with ANSI Cc, such as certain ANSI trigraph features that are rarely used, such as Unix and VAX, as well as features that are available in the host environment but not in the freestanding environment, such as all standard libraries available in the host environment and the main function returning an int value, a typical example being all programs except the kernel in almost all cases. Details can be found in the latest information on the gcc website.
For function declarations without parameters, such as "int foo ();", treat them in the C style --- that is, do not specify the number or type of parameters. (Only applicable to C++)
In normal circumstances, a function foo like this in C++ means that the parameter is empty.
The list of features removed from here targets certain aspects of support for traditional C compilers.
See NU c  manual for details, which we have deleted for the sake of brevity, so that when the content becomes outdated, people will not HERI.
There is one exception: For C++ programs (not C), the -traditional option has an additional effect, allowing this to be assigned a value.
It is similar to the effect of the "-ethis-is-variable" option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support certain aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
In particular, the content about the preprocessor, but not the other effects of the -traditional option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the '$' character in identifiers (only for C++) in the identifier (identifier).
You can specify the "-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers" option to make it clear that the "$" symbol is not allowed to be used.
(GNU C++ allows the `$' symbol by default on some target systems, but not on all systems.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion from the ant type to an enumeration type (MEF in C++) .
Under normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows the conversion from enum to int, but not the other way around.
-fexternal-—templates generates smaller code (limited to C++) by generating a copy of each template function only at the place where they are defined. This is the template declaration (template function).
To successfully use this option, you must mark "#pragma implementation" (definition) or "#Pragma interface" (declaration) in all files that use templates.
When the program is compiled with the option "-fexternal-templates", all template instances (template instantiation) are external types. You must make the instances required to appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved using typedef, which references each instance it needs.
Correspondingly, if the default option ` -fno-exteznal-templates' is used during compilation, all template instances are explicitly set to be internal.
All member functions (except for the constructor sub-functions and the mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class to which they belong.
This does not mean that every time a member function is called, it will be done via an internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a particular virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the second and third parameters of a conditional expression to have types that do not match.
The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable, which allows this to be assigned a value (only in C++).
After merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into C++, the assignable "this" becomes inappropriate.
Therefore, by default, assigning to this within a member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backwards compatibility, you can make this operation effective by using the -fthis-is-variable option.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, similar to unsigned char.
All kinds of machines have their own default char type, which may be unsigned char or signed char.
In an ideal situation, when data is used symbolically, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned char.
However, many programs have been written to use only simple chars, and they are signed numbers (or unsigned numbers, depending on the target machine where the program is written).
This option, and its opposite, makes the program work on the corresponding default value.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If the "signed" or "unsigned" modifiers are not specified explicitly, these options are used to define signed or unsigned bitfields (bitfields with sign bits).
By default, the domain is signed, because the basic integer types that they inherit, such as int, are signed numbers. However, if the "-traditional" option is specified, the domain is always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores constant strings into writable data segments without any special treatment.
This is for compatibility with some old programs, and the idea of modifying string constants is a very bad one, as is the "-traditional" option, which has the same effect.
Summary of execution
The impact of COVID-19 on the drug market
Its impact may be similar to the economic crisis of 2008
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, this disease has already overwhelmed medical service institutions, bringing them to the brink of collapse, and the restrictive measures implemented by governments of various countries have caused serious disruptions to the global economy.
The impact of this epidemic on the drug market is still unclear and difficult to predict, but it may have a profound impact.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs because restrictions on movement also restrict access to precursors and basic chemicals.
Smugglers unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions may have to find new routes and methods.
Drug use and provision patterns may change, and the government's ability to respond may also be impeded.
The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but we can still learn from past crises.
After the economic crisis of 2008, some drug users began to seek cheaper synthetic substances, and their use patterns shifted toward injecting drugs.
Meanwhile, governments of various countries have reduced budgets related to drugs.
If governments of various countries respond to the current economic downturn in the same way, interventions such as preventing drug use and related risky behaviors, and drug rehabilitation services may be severely affected.
In addition, the priority of interceptive actions and international cooperation may be reduced, making traffickers easier to operate.
Some countries have large amounts of drugs smuggled in through commercial flights, and these countries are expected to be most directly affected by drug trafficking activities.
Messengers carry synthetic drugs such as methylphenidate in their backpacks or conceal them in their personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Due to restrictions on air passenger travel almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs may be completely disrupted.
Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, the trafficking of goods through the dark web and postal shipments may increase.
In the long run, economic recession and related closure measures may disrupt the drug market.
Due to rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, the poor and vulnerable are more likely to consume drugs in harmful ways, develop drug-related diseases, and turn to illegal activities related to drugs, whether in production or trafficking.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation by providing services to vulnerable groups and recruiting new members to strengthen their ranks.
As the government's ability to respond declines, these changes may quickly take root and become the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and complexity
Market growth
The population growth model partly explains the reasons for market expansion
Drug abuse has been on the rise all over the world, both in terms of the total number of cases and the percentage of drug users in the world population.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 2.1 billion drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018, it was estimated that there were 2.69 billion drug users, accounting for 5.3% of this population.
Over the past twenty years, the growth rate of drug abuse in developing countries has been much faster than that of developed countries.
This to some extent reflects the differences in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
The largest proportion of drug users are young people and young adults.
During the period from 2000 to 2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while that of developed countries decreased by 10%.
Urbanization is a driving factor for both current and future drug markets.
In both developed and developing countries, drug abuse is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas.
One of the reasons for the overall increase in drug abuse is the large-scale migration of the population from rural areas to cities. Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, while in 1960, this proportion was only 34%.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in countries with more pronounced urbanization trends.
The increase in wealth is linked to the increase in drug use, but the people who bear the greatest burden of disease are the poorest in the world, and drug use is more widespread in developed countries than in developing ones.
Drugs such as cocaine are even more closely linked to the more affluent regions of the world.
Similarly, within each country, the prevalence of drug use among the wealthy social classes is relatively high.
However, the proportion of people who develop drug addiction is higher among those with a lower socioeconomic status.
Data from a few countries indicate that harmful drug use patterns are associated with both disease and low income.
These patterns seem to be less common in the more affluent social strata.
The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, which has historically been linked to an increase in drug use, have already forced millions of people worldwide to lose their jobs due to the pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to further expansion of the drug market. The widespread outbreak of COVID-19 may cause more farmers to increase or engage in the illegal cultivation of crops, or it may be due to a reduction in the control capabilities of the government authorities, or it may be due to the fact that more people may be forced to engage in illegal activities in the face of an economic crisis.
The related restrictions related to COVID-19 have led to a reduction in air and land transportation, and maritime trafficking may have increased as a result. The risk of interception at sea is lower, and there are more cases of smuggling by sea than by air or land.
Recently, there have been reports that cocaine goods are being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Complexity increases
The situation of the appearance of non-controlled substances is stable, but new types of opioids with potential harm are increasing in the drug market, which is becoming increasingly complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not subject to international control. The non-medical use of drugs has also increased rapidly.
Each year, there are about 500 new types of active substances on the domestic market of member countries.
Currently, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opioids.
Although the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.
In the total number of new psychoactive substance types determined in 2014, new opioid-like psychoactive substances accounted for only 2%, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.
There are many similarities between fentanyl and the new opioid-like psychoactive substances, and their effects and risks have been proven. They have caused overdose deaths in North America, but to a lesser extent in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is used as an adulterant for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and is also used to produce counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
Some evidence suggests that the injection of new psychoactive substances with stimulant effects is also a phenomenon in Europe: A study of residues of discarded syringes in six European cities found that many of them were contaminated with new psychoactive substances that produce stimulant effects.
The use of two new psychoactive substances may gradually become entrenched in vulnerable groups
A new type of psychoactive substance of a single class has almost never formed a large market.
However, evidence from Europe indicates that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among homeless people and prison inmates, among other socially marginalized groups.
22 countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most countries identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.
The regulation of precursor chemicals has forced drug manufacturers to innovate, and many of the chemicals used as precursors to synthesize phenylisobutamine, methylphenylisobutamine, and "headache pills" and other drugs have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and drug manufacturers have always been looking for alternatives, which not only have looser controls but also special chemicals designed specifically to evade controls, known as "precursors."
Restrictive measures intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze the livelihoods of drug producers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico indicates that this has become a reality: According to reports, the shortage of methylphenidate precursors imported from East Asia in March 2020 led to a rise in the prices of methylphenidate in Mexico and the United States.
The market is constantly changing
Synthetic drugs replace opioids in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation seems to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The amount of opioids intercepted by Russian Federation authorities has decreased by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has decreased significantly.
However, the market for performance-enhancing drugs seems to be flourishing.
Evidence indicates that methylphenidate and various cathinones, including methoxyphenidine and α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone, are now widely available on the Russian drug market.
According to a report by Russian authorities, the number of secret manufacturing sites producing various illegal drugs has sharply increased recently, doubling in two years to 152 sites in 2018.
The Afghan and Iraqi methylphenidate markets are growing
As early as 2012, an investigation into hospital, prison, and other institutional personnel in Iraq revealed the importance of methylphenidate there.
Crystalline methylphenidate has become another major drug of concern, along with "fenoterol" and "salbutamol", outside of "clenbuterol".
A study conducted in 2015 further confirmed these findings, with drug users indicating that marijuana is harder to obtain than "fenanyl" or methamphetamine.
Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered several methylphenidate processing points. The DEA has expressed concern about the large-scale importation of pseudoephedrine-based products from these points, as methylphenidate is used as a precursor for these products.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine production seems to have begun in 2014.
Since then, the amount of methylphenidate seized has been steadily increasing.
However, the amount seized in the first half of 2019 was 657 kg, a huge increase from the previous year.
In other countries, large quantities of methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan have been seized, indicating that the country's production is rapidly increasing.
Policy changes and trends
Most jurisdictions where the use of marijuana for non-medical purposes has been legalized have seen an increase in marijuana use
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay, and the United States allow the manufacture of marijuana products for non-medical use.
In most jurisdictions, marijuana use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has also been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical use of marijuana.
In the two states that passed legislation the earliest in the United States, Colorado and Washington, the number of adults using marijuana for non-medical purposes has increased, especially in the past month and on a daily or almost daily basis, surpassing the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that marijuana use in Uruguay has increased since 2011, and last month's use was nearly double that of the previous month.
The increase is mainly due to frequent and regular use of marijuana.
Short-term data from Canada also indicates that while the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, consumption also increased.
However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained certain products from illegal sources.
The decline in global marijuana drug seizures is due to the legalization of marijuana?
In 2018, the amount of marijuana seized worldwide fell to the lowest level in 20 years, due to a decrease in seizures in North America, which fell by 84% over the past 10 years.
In comparison, the amount seized in other parts of the world during the same period almost doubled. The pattern of seizures indicates that policies aimed at opening up the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a deterrent effect, but it is still difficult to assess the effectiveness of the regulation of new psychoactive substances domestically.
Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different rates of use of new psychoactive substances.
In some other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after the enactment of domestic legislation.
The vulnerable population faces harm from both legal and illegal drug markets in the form of pain management and opioid-based drugs for palliative treatment, which are mainly provided in high-income countries, with painkillers distributed unevenly across regions.
In 2018, more than 90% of all medicinal opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
Approximately 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
The population of these countries accounts for about 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that the population of low-income and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but the consumption of medicinal opioids is less than 10%.
Obstacles to obtaining medicinal opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescription practices.
People from a lower socioeconomic background are at a higher risk of drug addiction. In 2018, about 35.6 million people suffered from drug addiction.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of substance abuse disorders and exacerbate their consequences. High-income countries' research confirms this point, with studies showing that individuals' unfavorable socioeconomic trajectories are not only related to their status at a particular point in time, but also to the risk of substance abuse disorders.
Drug addiction also exacerbates social and economic disadvantages, further increasing the risks of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby perpetuating a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These results may also be related to the demeaning attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, minorities, migrants, and groups with diverse sexual orientations, as well as people who have been displaced due to armed conflicts or disasters, and those living in rural areas, may be disproportionately affected by drug-related health problems, or face difficulties in accessing treatment services.
According to the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death, harmful drug use has had a more widespread impact on society over the past 10 years.
Between 2007 and 2018, the global disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use increased by 17%.
The increase in life expectancy adjusted for disability due to liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis B infection among intravenous drug users is particularly high—up to 40%.
The complex relationship between drugs and violence makes it difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited data from around the world suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in murder.
However, alcohol seems to play a greater role in violent incidents than drugs do.
Although drug use may lead to crime, in some cases, the link can be partially attributed to a variety of intermediary factors such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by individual risk, family environment, and peer influence.
The connection between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is a stable criminal structure, including large-scale organized crime activities such as international drug trafficking, these activities may be carried out without violence under certain circumstances.
In the short term, the presence and extent of violence is more dependent on changes that upset the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of illegal markets, the death or imprisonment of notorious criminals, and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another. These factors are more important than the amount of trafficking.
Latest trends
Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids pose the greatest risk
It is estimated that in 2018, 192 million people used marijuana, making it the most widely used drug in the world.
By contrast, 58 million people used opioid-like drugs in 2018.
However, the related dangers of opioid drugs have been overlooked due to their limited use.
In the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug abuse in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances. In the estimated 2.1 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death caused by drug abuse, 50% were caused by these substances.
The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the culprit exacerbating the opioid crisis is khat; in North America, it is fentanyl. These two regions have almost nothing in common economically, demographically, or in terms of general drug use patterns, but they are both struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in the number of opioid overdose deaths in the past 20 years.
In 2018, 67,367 excess deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl in two-thirds of the cases.
Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.
One of the reasons that fentanyl causes excessive deaths is the unpredictable effects of fentanyl in the illegal drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for non-medical khat has seen significant growth.
In this region, more and more patients with the disease are using quinidine for treatment.
In 2017, the amount of cocaine seized globally significantly increased, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.
However, in 2018, after India passed a new law to regulate the trade of khat, the global seizure amount dropped to 32 tons.
The crises in these two places were caused by the simplicity of manufacturing and low production costs, as well as the lack of international regulation for cocaine and many fentanyl-like substances or their precursors such as ketamine.
The crisis in these two places is aggravated by the fact that these substances are available in both the drug market and the illegal market, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
The use of performance-enhancing drugs is increasing
The field of performance-enhancing drugs is dominated by cocaine and methylphenidate, and the use of both substances is on the rise in their main markets.
In 2018, about 1.9 million people used cocaine, because cocaine is quite popular in North America and Western Europe.
Approximately 27 million people used phenylisopropylamine that year, of which methylphenylisopropylamine was the most widely used phenylisopropylamine stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to the majority of indicators we have access to, the use of methylphenidate in these two regions has been expanding over the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes being substituted for one another, so that when the use of one drug increases, the use of the other decreases, sometimes simultaneously increasing and decreasing to meet the same market demand.
COVID-19 increases the risk for intravenous drug users
It is estimated that in 2018, about 11.3 million people injected drugs, and about 10% of global HIV infections are caused by injecting drugs.
More than 1 million intravenous drug users have been infected with the AIDS virus, and 5.5 million have hepatitis B.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug overdoses, half of whom died from liver disease caused by hepatitis B, and most intravenous drug users still have untreated hepatitis B.
The shortage of opioids caused by the COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute them with alcohol or phenyltropane drugs that are easier to obtain, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injections or increase the frequency of injections, there may be more harmful usage patterns.

EU Summit Struggles with Refugee Policy, EU Officials: Acceptance Process Fraught with Obstacles - China News Service
The EU summit has been embroiled in disputes over refugee policy, with EU officials saying that every step of the admission process is a bottleneck
[Global Times Correspondent in Belgium Niu Ruifei] According to a report by AFP on February 10, at the latest EU summit that day, EU Council President von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to adopt stricter policies on illegal immigration to make it easier to expel illegal immigrants.
According to reports, the EU's action is a response to the growing problem of illegal immigration in Europe, and now the core issue for the EU is that the number of illegal immigrants who can ultimately be deported is very small.
According to the summit documents, EU leaders called on the commission to "immediately mobilize large amounts of EU funds" to strengthen the external borders through infrastructure and monitoring, among other means.
However, the EU and its member states have been arguing endlessly about the issue of fence costs.
Frondelein repeatedly stated that EU funds would not cover the related costs.
However, some member states' diplomats said that if the EU could shoulder part of the cost of installing cameras, lookout towers, and other infrastructure along the external borders, this would free up national budgets and accelerate the construction process.
According to the Euractiv website in Europe, EU officials admit that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee admission process. The limited admission capacity and overburdened immigration authorities of member states are unable to prevent refugees from submitting "numerous" asylum applications in EU member states, and the EU's refugee admission system is in a near-permanent state of crisis.
According to an estimate by the European Commission, the Schengen countries in the EU received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half compared to the previous year.
Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal border crossings last year.
Against this backdrop, the summit also reached an agreement on a "principle," namely that EU member states can deport illegal immigrants back to their home country based on the ruling of a court in another member state.
In addition, the report states that the EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of security states," which will pave the way for the EU to draw up a common list.

The US escalates the "chip war" and deals a heavy blow to the global semiconductor industry - China News Service
Recently, the United States has been escalating its "chip war" against China. First, under U.S. pressure, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to impose controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; then, foreign media reported that the U.S. government is considering cutting off all ties between U.S. suppliers and Huawei, banning U.S. suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; and the Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order restricting U.S. investment in China's sensitive technology industries... In the early days of 2023, the United States has been using all sorts of dirty tricks to curb China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped its actions to suppress China's "chip" development. On the one hand, it has carried out precise pressure on China's semiconductor production and supply chains; on the other hand, it has built a "de-Chinese" semiconductor industrial chain alliance to plot a complete "breakaway" from China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to establish a "technology alliance" with South Korea to win its favor, or to form a "four-way alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan in China to build a semiconductor "four-way alliance," or to establish a "small circle" of the semiconductor industrial chain through the "Quadrilateral Mechanism" and the "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework" between the United States, Japan, India, and Australia, the United States attempts to build a closed production and supply chain by introducing politicized, alliance-based, and weaponized approaches to the semiconductor industry, in order to compensate for its shortcomings in semiconductor manufacturing and maintain its leading position in the global semiconductor industry.
However, the United States' high-profile "chip warfare" against China is also "injurious to the enemy but detrimental to oneself."
Recently, Lam Research, a well-known US semiconductor manufacturing equipment supplier, announced that due to the impact of the latest round of export restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plans to lay off another 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
Recently, global lithography giant ASML Holding N.V. of the Netherlands warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to a rise in semiconductor prices.
American media analyzed that after the U.S. government imposed heavy-handed pressure on China's semiconductor and related industries, many U.S. companies suffered greatly, including EDA tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves.
The United States' so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a global semiconductor industrial chain with close ties has already been formed.
According to estimates by professional experts, the entire production process of semiconductor products requires more than 70 crossings of national borders and takes more than 100 days to complete, thanks to the process of specialization and division of labor.
Although the US semiconductor industry has a relatively strong foundation, its manufacturing capabilities, especially in advanced process technologies, are relatively weak, and it is heavily dependent on the East Asian region.
Even though the United States has made every effort to guide advanced chip production and supply chains to move toward a regionalized development model dominated by the United States, the global semiconductor-related industry's regional distribution and interdependence are difficult to change.
The United States has "reformed" the semiconductor industry chain in a "de-Chinese" manner, causing a heavy blow to the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the future industry, and the development of the chip industry depends on the participation of all countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, including the enactment of the Innovation and Competition Act, the 2022 U.S. Competition Act, and the Chips and Science Act, to use its technological hegemony to consolidate its technological leadership, and to "reward and punish" its allies, luring Intel, TSMC, Samsung, and other semiconductor manufacturers to set up factories in the United States to ensure its global leadership in the semiconductor industry.
In the short term, the United States has indeed created difficulties for China's semiconductor industry and related industries, and gained real benefits.
However, in the long run, the United States' irrational suppression will force China's semiconductor industry to constantly break through, ultimately weakening the innovation motivation and innovation capability of American technology companies, and harming the development of the global semiconductor industry.

First batch of personal pension fund investment products go on sale, with a minimum holding period of 360 days - China News Service
The first batch of individual pension fund investment products are now on sale
7 products are available from home institutions, with the shortest term being 360 days
Personal pension investment products have finally gone online.
On February 10, China Rongzhi Finance Network released the first batch of individual pension fund investment product lists. Seven individual pension fund investment products from Industrial Bank, Agricultural Bank, and China Post were officially launched.
At this point, the "shelf" of personal pension accounts has finally been filled with four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension investment, personal pension insurance, and publicly offered personal pension funds.
It was reported that the first batch of personal pension fund investment products are all open-ended net asset value-type public fund products, of which five are newly launched products and two are existing products. Except for one product that is a mixed-asset type, the other six products are fixed-income type.
A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily saw that of the 5 newly launched products, 4 were from Industrial Bank Wealth Management, all of which were fixed-income products, with holding periods of 365 days, 540 days, 720 days, and 1080 days, and corresponding performance benchmarks (annualized) of 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, and 5.25% - 5.75%.
The remaining new product is "Postal Savings Wealth Enrichment - Hongjin 1095 1", which is also a fixed-income product. It began collecting funds on February 10 and ended on February 19. The risk level is two.
Of the two surviving products, one is the Nongyuan Investment "Nongyuan Tongxin·Lingdong" 360-Day Technology Innovation Renminbi Investment Product with a mixed investment nature and a risk level of three.
The other surviving product is "China Post-Industrial Bank Wealth Management - Hongjing 365 1", a fixed-income type product, which began collecting funds on December 30, 2017, and officially began operations on January 4, 2018. Its cumulative net asset value as of February 8 was 1.0011.
According to the "Opinion of the State Council Office of the People's Republic of China on Promoting the Development of Individual Pension Funds", the financial products that can be invested in the individual pension fund account include bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and publicly offered funds.
The first batch of personal pension fund investment products has been launched, marking the official start of personal pension fund investors purchasing financial products through their personal pension fund accounts.
Last November, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission drafted the Provisional Regulations on the Management of Individual Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Fund Management Companies.
The Regulations stipulate that participants can purchase individual pension products, such as individual pension savings, individual pension investment products, individual pension insurance products, and individual pension publicly offered fund products, through their individual pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation jointly issued a notice to clarify that the individual pension system will be implemented in 36 pilot cities and areas, including Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Shijiazhuang, Xiongan New Area, Shanxi Jinan City, and other areas.
As of the end of 2022, the number of participants in the Individual Pension Plan was 19.54 million, the number of contributors was 6.13 million, and the total amount of contributions was 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks participating in the pilot only offered three types of products: personal retirement savings, personal retirement insurance products, and publicly offered personal retirement funds.
Now that personal pension investment products have been assembled, how should investors choose?
Experts from the Development Department of Industrial Bank Wealth Management said that compared with other individual pension products, the pilot-phase pension wealth management products and individual pension wealth management products both have three distinct features.
The first is stability, the risk management mechanism is more robust, the investment strategy and philosophy are more conservative, and third-party independent custody by non-parent institutions is implemented.
Second, it is long-term. The maturity period of pilot-phase elderly care financial products is all over 5 years, and the minimum maturity period of the next batch of individual retirement savings financial products to be issued will be 1 year, with encouragement to hold for 3 years or more.
Third, it is inclusive. The purchase threshold is low, and the minimum purchase amount is usually 1 yuan. Some are as low as 0.01 yuan, and the custody fees, management fees, and other fees are also more favorable.
Professionals point out that investors should choose products based on their characteristics and their own risk tolerance.
The personal pension savings have the characteristics of long-term duration, high interest rates, and high safety, which are suitable for people with low risk tolerance; the personal pension insurance products emphasize protection, and are more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks and are willing to accept stable returns; while the personal pension wealth management products and publicly offered fund products do not guarantee principal or returns, and involve certain investment risks, but have higher expected returns, which are suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and higher risk tolerance.

The fitness industry should overcome the trust crisis - Xinhua News Agency
Another large fitness center "blows up"?
Recently, the issue of members' rights protection at the well-known fitness institution Zhengzheng Fitness has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members discovered that their local store was not operating normally, and then rumors about the institution closing and running away caused members to panic, leading to the intervention of police and social security departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the institution came forward to respond, promising to strive to protect the legitimate rights of employees and members, thereby putting an end to the controversy.
Some stores of certain fitness centers have temporarily closed due to operational issues, but consumers could have remained calm and waited for the issues to be resolved. Why do many members' first reaction to this be "something is wrong"?
The fitness club member rights protection controversy is a deep-seated problem of the industry's trust crisis.
Traditional gyms in China generally adopt a prepaid payment model, and the underlying logic of their development is to "earn money from users who don't come."
By obtaining cash flow through pre-sale of membership cards, opening new stores continuously, it appears to be a cyclical process, but in reality it is a case of eating the goose that lays the golden eggs, which cannot form a stable profit model.
Negative news about gyms going bust and other industries has been frequently reported, causing a strong impact on the confidence of consumers.
From a market perspective, a fitness center is certainly a good business with "money-making potential."
The fitness track has ups and downs, but it has always attracted the attention of capital.
A number of indicators show that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption, among other areas, continues to rise, and the market continues to recover.
In terms of the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards, the concept of a healthy lifestyle has become deeply rooted in people's minds, and the fitness industry has great potential for development.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to quality development.
However, some institutions are overly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption, having just emerged from the crisis. They sound the trumpet of expansion and invest all their fundraising money in building new stores.
It cannot be denied that in recent years, the pandemic has caused many institutions to exit the market, and the industry has been reshuffled. At this time, when strong companies choose to increase their acquisition efforts and reposition themselves selectively, this is certainly a new opportunity.
However, in order for the fitness market to enter a virtuous cycle and move towards a sustainable and prosperous future, the industry must change its traditional mode of operation and adjust its business strategies.
Only by working steadily and rebuilding consumer trust and security can we truly win the market and the future.
Compared to aggressively expanding new stores to grab the market, the fitness industry currently needs to focus on improving services and stabilizing users by pursuing high-quality development.
First, we need to retain users by providing good service.
A fitness center is a service industry, and its essence is to adhere to "user-centricity." It should focus on improving service quality and upgrading service by centering operations on user needs.
Second, we need to improve user experience through digital transformation.
For example, the popular current internet fitness studio model allows users to pay by the session and choose the location.
At the same time, the body data and exercise data can be effectively utilized, and it can also meet social needs, achieving a complete service loop from online to offline.
Without the sales pitch of personal trainers, without the high-priced annual memberships, users' concerns about gyms "running away" have been reduced, and their trust has also been enhanced.
In addition, we also need to actively explore diverse business models.
Today, sports consumption has moved from single-service consumption to scene consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption. Around the peripheral products such as sports nutrition and fitness equipment required for fitness, new profit points may emerge, providing consumers with more choices.

"Differential compensation" returns to the Nanjing real estate market - China News Network
Yangzi Evening Post reports (reporter Ma Chubo): Yangzi Evening Post/Zi Niu News reporters discovered on the 10th during an interview that the "price guarantee agreement," which had not been seen for more than a decade, had once again returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A housing project in the Jiangbei New Area claimed to offer "compensation for the difference in price," with discounts on other properties being greater than those previously offered, and the developer willing to exchange properties and refund the difference.
"Floor price agreement" conditions are not few
The apartment complex located in the Jiangbei New Area is called Poly Yangtze Cloud Terrace. Mr. Sun, who came to view the apartments, told the reporter that he found a "declaration" there last weekend.
The pictures he sent to the reporter showed that the developer promised that anyone who purchased a property in the development between February 1 and February 28 would be able to exchange their property and get a refund of the difference if the discount on other properties in the project was greater than the discount they had previously enjoyed (limited to other properties of the same type, in the same building, floor, unit, and property type in the same development that had not yet been sold), starting from the day the purchase contract was signed.
Mr. Sun said that the property consultant explained that this was actually a "price guarantee agreement," the purpose of which was to make the buyer feel at ease and not have to worry about the developer's discount promotions. "Now I'm afraid that after I buy it, the price will be lowered, and I don't have time to go to the sales office to make a fuss. If I don't make a fuss, I'm sure I'll feel at ease," he said.
Many homebuyers also believe that the "price guarantee agreement" is a "calming pill" for buyers, but the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a starter home in Jiangbei, said that the first priority for a fixed-price property is that it must be of the same type, and it must be in the same building and unit. There are very few properties available for comparison shopping, so the "threshold" is still quite high.
Some buyers also believe that, due to the asymmetry of information, additional discounts may be offered at the time of sale, making it difficult for buyers to "assert their rights."
Whether homebuyers will stay put remains to be seen
The reporter learned from online real estate listings in Nanjing that the project was granted the right to sell a total of 252 units, consisting of two buildings, in November last year. The unit sizes range from 105 square meters to 129 square meters, and the average selling price for fully furnished units is 39,843 yuan per square meter.
However, more than two months have passed, and the online real estate data shows that the total number of unsold units in the project is currently 157 units, accounting for 62.3%, of which there are 128 units in Building 8, 113 of which are unsold, and 44 of the 124 units in Building 7 are also unsold. The total number of units sold in the project is only 33, accounting for 13%.
Market participants said that the "price guarantee agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, the Xiyuan Xishan Road project in Huaxi District launched the "Price Protection Plan" to attract buyers' attention. The specific content of the plan was "The company solemnly promises that if the project's discount is expanded within a year, the difference will be refunded to old homeowners."
Later in April 2011, nine residential projects in Nanjing also offered "differential compensation" for a portion of their units.
"The property market is recovering, and now it needs a "stimulant" more than ever.
Mr. Shen, a senior operator in the real estate industry in Nanjing, said, "The 'floor price agreement' is also one of the marketing methods used by real estate companies.
He believes that nowadays, developers need more confidence than homebuyers do, and the launch of the "price guarantee agreement" is actually a way to boost their confidence.
As for whether homebuyers will stay put, he said that this depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulation policies and loan thresholds, and at present it remains to be seen.
Taiwan's Economy Started the Year Poorly Amid Multiple Data Declines - China News Service
Xinhua News Agency Taipei, February 11 (Reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yang) Taiwan's export trade volume "fell five times in a row," the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) has contracted for seven consecutive months, and the consumer price index (CPI) has returned to the "3" range... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
Experts believe that Taiwan's economic performance at the start of the year was poor, and the pressure to grow is significant.
According to the financial management department of the Taiwan authorities, exports from the Taiwan region in January amounted to $31.51 billion, down 21.2% year-on-year, marking the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
The export value of the 11 major export goods all declined compared to the same period last year.
Rubber and its products, as well as optical instruments, fell the most, with decreases of 37.6% and 35.7% respectively.
Exports of electronic components decreased by 20.1% in the year, the largest decline in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits fell by 18.3% year-on-year, marking the largest decline in 14 years.
Consumer Electronics Statistics Director Tsai Meina said that this indicates that the weak demand effect of the consumer electronics industry has spread, and that the electronics industry has entered a corrective phase.
Statistics show that Taiwan's imports and exports both declined in January, and the excess amount was only US$2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The financial management department of the Taiwan authorities believes that global end-market demand has decreased, and industry adjustments have suppressed the willingness of manufacturers to purchase raw materials, resulting in a short-term downturn in exports. Taiwan's export decline in the first quarter of this year is likely to be worse than expected.
According to the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, the Taiwan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) after seasonal adjustment in January was 40.4%, down 3.3 percentage points from December of last year, and contracted for the seventh consecutive month.
In the economic monitoring index system, PMI is the dividing line between expansion and contraction at 50%. If the index is greater than 50%, it indicates expansion, and if it is less than 50%, it indicates contraction.
In January, the five components of the PMI for Taiwan showed that new orders, production, and labor employment contracted, supplier delivery times decreased, and inventories contracted.
All six major industries reported a contraction in PMI, with each industry ranked according to the rate of contraction as the power and machinery equipment industry (35.1%), the electronic and optical industry (35.2%), the chemical and biotechnology medical industry (39.2%), the basic raw material industry (42.4%), the transportation equipment industry (42.6%), and the food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the "Bureau of Statistics" of the Taiwan authorities announced that the Taiwan CPI annual growth rate in January was 3.04%, breaking the 3% mark again since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared by 28.25%, reaching a 17-month high.
Zhang Zhixiong, a special commissioner of the "Taiwan Bureau of Statistics", admitted that the price increase of vegetables exceeded expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year, and inflationary pressure still exists and is at a high point.
Looking ahead to Taiwan's economy this year, experts are pessimistic, according to reports from domestic media such as the United Daily News and Yahoo Finance.
Professor Wu Dajian of "National Central University" in Taiwan analyzed that the decline in exports may lead to cash flow problems for export manufacturers and an increase in the risk of debt default.
At the same time, the reduction in orders has led manufacturers to reduce labor costs, which has affected the labor market and household economy, and in turn has impacted consumption capacity.
Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Economic Research Institute, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States has not been resolved this year, and demand continues to shrink. He predicts that Taiwan's export downturn will continue into the first half of the year.
Due to the fact that Taiwan's economy is supported by exports, the economic growth for the whole year will be less than last year due to the downturn in exports.
"A major engine of global recovery" - China News Network
In the face of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese economy has demonstrated great resilience.
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community generally views China's future development in a positive light.
Recently, well-known Chinese expert on Sino-Spanish relations and honorary advisor to the China Policy Observer Network, Julio Reyes, said in an interview with our reporter that the current stage of China's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new phase, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further released.
Liuos said that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has responded calmly and effectively with its extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully demonstrating its economic resilience and management level.
While China is steadfastly expanding its opening up to the outside world, the inward driving force of economic development is constantly strengthening, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises are working together to develop.
Every year, the National People's Congress and the National Political Consultative Conference are held in China, where representatives and delegates jointly discuss the country's development plans and deliberate on issues related to the people's livelihood, thereby gathering consensus, uniting the people's hearts, and gathering wisdom, thereby adding strength to China's development.
Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term high-speed development and has now entered the stage of high-quality development.
The international community expects China's wisdom and China's solutions, and expects China to bring new opportunities to the world as it develops.
"Lios said that at present, China is vigorously promoting technological innovation to inject new impetus into economic and social development. "Financial input, talent cultivation, and policy incentives have made China full of vitality in the new five-year plan," he said.
In Riíos' view, economic system reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China has both taken advantage of the benefits of the market economy and the superiority of socialist systems, and adopted proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Based on the strategic focus of expanding domestic demand, China will increase the intensity of financial support for the real economy, support the development of private, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the manufacturing industry, adhere to innovation-driven development, promote employment, increase the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meet the diverse and multi-layered consumption needs of the people, etc. China will comprehensively, accurately and completely implement the new development concept, and focus on promoting high-quality development, building a new development pattern, and will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative.
" After the epidemic, stabilizing and recovering the economy is a common goal of the international community.
The potential for China's economic development continues to be released, bringing more benefits to the world and becoming an important engine for global recovery.
Lios said that he expects the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative to continue to play an important role in improving the infrastructure level of all countries and enhancing interconnectivity across all sectors, thereby releasing greater energy.

Henan Province Standardizes and Integrates Dental Implant Medical Services Prices - China News Service
According to CCTV News, dental implants are the ideal choice for many patients with missing teeth, but the high price tag of thousands of yuan per tooth has always deterred many patients.
This year, as the accelerated implementation of implant dentures procurement accelerates, local governments have also put the issue of lowering the price of implant dentures on the agenda.
From February 10 onwards, the medical service price for a single conventional dental implant in Henan Province will be fully controlled throughout the process, with the target price set at 4,300 yuan. The total cost of a single conventional dental implant procedure will not exceed 97% of the target price.
Dental implants refer to a method of tooth restoration that uses a lower structure embedded in the bone tissue to support and fix the upper dental prosthesis in place.
Reporters learned from Zhengzhou University First Affiliated Hospital that, as an example, the cost of a single conventional implant from implantation to final restoration is approximately RMB16,700.
Patient He Ying: After the new policy was implemented, the doctor told me that for cases like mine, the cost would be around 8,000 yuan, less than 10,000 yuan, and I could save half.
Based on the existing projects, Henan Province has also integrated and determined the prices of 15 dental implant medical services, including "implantation fee (per implant)", and unified the prices and medical insurance payment categories for provincial-level public medical institutions. It has also cancelled or adjusted the prices of 20 medical services, including dental implantation procedures.
Li Yunjie, Director of the Pharmaceutical Pricing and Bidding Department of the Zhengzhou Medical Insurance Protection Bureau: The main beneficiaries are the four sides, one of which is the medical insurance, whose expenditure has decreased; the pressure on hospitals has decreased, and patients will appropriately increase; for suppliers, they have gained a market; and for our patients, this is the greatest benefit, as the cost of a tooth implant may be reduced by half or more.

"New variables" are emerging in China's e-commerce industry. How can live-streaming achieve "content is king"?
- Xinhua News Agency
China News Service, February 11 - Title: "New variables" emerge in China's e-commerce industry; how to make "content king" when livestreaming?
Xia Bin, a reporter for China News Service Finance,
"We entered the e-commerce market a bit late, but we realized from the very beginning that content is very important if you want to stand out from the millions of stores.
"Fangfang", a 90s girl from Guangdong, now operates an online store for nutritional ingredients on Douyin e-commerce, allowing a 30-year-old offline store to "bloom" online.
Opening the @fengfengyirenchutiao account on Douyin, one is greeted by beautiful videos with a classic Cantonese song soundtrack, reminiscent of old Hong Kong films.
Recently, Douyin e-commerce held the "Finding Companions and Sharing High-Quality Content" event, and Fangfang, as a representative of high-quality creators, attended and spoke about her daily creative experiences and insights.
She said at the scene, "The carefully edited video attracted a lot of attention from netizens, and many people were interested in my ingredients and wanted to cook with me, which opened up a lot of sales opportunities.

Fangfang used the instant noodle cooking videos to make more people fall in love with the "taste of Guangdong," and a single live broadcast sold up to 300,000 pieces of nutritious ingredients, saving her family's nearly bankrupt store.
"No content, no e-commerce," as short videos and live-stream e-commerce continue to develop, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early stages of live shopping, broadcasters often used low-price discounts to attract users, and the price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, there have been both phenomenal KOLs such as Liu Xiaohong and Dongfang Zhenxuan, as well as many non-mainstream experts and merchants who have emerged in vertical niche markets. They have achieved long-term operational benefits by continuously creating high-quality content that is in line with their brand characteristics.
TikTok e-commerce star author operation manager Gaoxiaoxuan introduced that in the past year, 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through TikTok e-commerce, and their content creation volume has increased by 252%, while the total transaction volume has more than doubled.
"Behind these numbers, we can feel the vibrancy and vitality of a thriving author ecosystem.
" Ga Yaoxuan said.
The Beijing Normal University Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform previously released the "E-commerce Industry Content Ecosystem Health Index (ECHI) Report", which analyzed from a data perspective the importance of high-quality content as a "new variable" in the current e-commerce industry, and used the index to evaluate the content ecosystem of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China.
According to the e-commerce industry content ecosystem health ranking in the aforementioned report, Douyin E-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com ranked in the top five.
The report believes that the content ecosystem in the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce with content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Only good PGC (professional content production) and UGC (user-generated content) are the high-quality carriers for integrating e-commerce, and the higher the value of the content platform, the more diverse the scenarios of consumption and promotion will be, and the greater the possibility of e-commerce integration, the stronger the commercial value will be, and the proportion of content production and consumption in the public and private domains that are gradually integrated will also be higher.
On site, Professor Guomin Yu of Beijing Normal University's School of Journalism and Communication, and Chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Committee, analyzed and interpreted the "Report".
He said that, in terms of content value, the e-commerce industry has transitioned from the "accessibility of consumption" to the "qualityization of consumption" stage, and high-quality, professional, differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the fundamental and driving force for the next stage of e-commerce development. Knowledge-based, professional, and KOL (key opinion leader) PGC content has become a standard feature of e-commerce live streaming.
Looking to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guomin proposed two suggestions.
From the perspective of content structure improvement, the goal is to promote the overall improvement of the health and quality of the e-commerce content ecosystem, establish positive standards for content creation and management, and achieve a dynamic balance between the e-commerce industry's content ecosystem health index.
The other is from the perspective of external ecology, to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value co-creation and co-construction of the external environment.
"In the future, the e-commerce industry will need more data and artificial intelligence support to make predictions about the stability of future development; in addition, it is necessary to provide more standardized and healthy growth space for merchants to create a healthy content ecosystem that integrates the values of enterprises, users, products, and services.

Trading in financing and margin trading on the Beijing Stock Exchange will start next week - China News Network
Beijing Evening News reports (reporter Sun Jie): Last night, the Beijing Stock Exchange announced that, following the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the financing and securities lending trading business of the Beijing Stock Exchange will officially commence on February 13. At that time, securities companies that have obtained the right to engage in financing and securities lending trading on the Beijing Stock Exchange will be able to accept investor orders and submit trading applications to the exchange.
The first batch of 56 financing and margin lending target stocks was determined based on the calculation reference date of January 31, 2023.
The North Exchange said that the list of securities for financing and margin trading and the list of securities eligible for offsetting margin requirements will be published in the "Information Disclosure - Margin Trading Information" section of its official website for the convenience of investors.

Xinhua News Agency Beijing, February 11 - Title: Advancing Chinese-style modernization is a systematic undertaking - On the profound understanding of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening ceremony of the seminar on studying and implementing the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress
Xinhua News Agency commentator
" Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic undertaking that requires coordinated efforts, comprehensive planning, and overall implementation. It requires us to properly handle the relationships between top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, orthodoxy and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and openness to the outside world, and other major relationships.
At the opening ceremony of the seminar on studying and implementing the Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization construction, and profoundly and systematically elaborated on the series of major relationships that need to be handled properly in practice, providing us with a scientific methodology for vigorously advancing Chinese-style modernization.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves all areas, including the economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization, and affects the governance of the party, the country, and the military, as well as domestic and foreign affairs, and national defense. It requires both systematic planning and the courage to reform and innovate, and aims to achieve continuous progress across the board.
Top-level design requires a profound understanding of the world's development trends, an accurate grasp of the common aspirations of the people, a deep exploration of the laws governing economic and social development, and the formulation of a planning and policy system that is timely, reflects the laws of development, is creative, and integrates the distant with the near, the upper with the lower, and the contents with each other.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory endeavor, and there are many unknown areas that need to be boldly explored in practice. We must promote the development of the enterprise through reform and innovation, and never be overly cautious or conservative.
Strategic issues are fundamental issues for a political party and a country.
To advance Chinese-style modernization, we must strengthen the foresight of strategy, use scientific strategic foresight to predict the future and lead the future; we must strengthen the comprehensiveness of strategy, focus on solving major issues that are crucial to the rise and fall of the party and the state, and have far-reaching implications; and we must strengthen the stability of strategy, once a strategy is formed, it must be adhered to for a long time, implemented to the end, and implemented well.
We must scientifically grasp the dialectical unity between strategy and tactics, and organically combine the principled nature of strategy with the flexibility of tactics, so as to be flexible, agile, and able to adapt to changing situations, make on-the-spot decisions, and seize the strategic initiative in accordance with local conditions, the situation, and circumstances.
The Chinese nation is a nation of integrity and innovation.
It is important to strike a balance between maintaining continuity and promoting innovation. We must uphold the essence and soul of Chinese-style modernization, which is the source and root of China’s modernization, and never waver in our commitment to its Chinese characteristics, fundamental requirements, and major principles. We must ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization and put innovation in a prominent position in the country’s overall development. We must respond to the requirements of the times and focus on resolving major theoretical and practical issues. We must actively adapt to change, respond to change, and seek change, vigorously promote reform and innovation, continuously create new driving forces and advantages for development, and fully unleash the creative energy of the entire society.
Efficiency is an important foundation for fairness, and fairness is a powerful guarantee for efficiency.
We are advancing Chinese-style modernization, which requires us to create higher efficiencies than capitalism and more effectively maintain social fairness, so as to better achieve the simultaneous pursuit of efficiency and fairness.
It is important to strike a balance between efficiency and fairness, and to continuously achieve development for the people, development relying on the people, and development outcomes shared by the people, so that the fruits of modernization can benefit the people more fairly and comprehensively.
To advance Chinese-style modernization, we need to handle the relationship between vitality and order well, so that society is both vibrant and orderly.
We must do a good job of balancing development and security, adhere to the general theory of national security, strengthen the national security system, enhance the ability to safeguard national security, and firmly safeguard the security of the state government, institutions, ideology, and key areas.
In the process of development, more attention is paid to security factors, and the country's security strength is enhanced through development. Development outcomes are used to consolidate the foundation of national security, and the country is also good at creating a security environment conducive to economic and social development, which continuously stimulates development vitality and achieves high-quality development and high-level security in a positive interaction.
To advance Chinese-style modernization, we must adhere to our own path while also broadening our worldview, upholding openness to the outside world, and constantly expanding the breadth and depth of Chinese-style modernization.
We must adhere to independence and self-reliance, and put the development of the country and the nation on the foundation of our own strength. We must firmly grasp the destiny of China's development and progress in our own hands.
We must continue to expand high-level opening-up, actively participate in global industrial division of labor and cooperation, fully utilize both domestic and international resources, and expand the space for the development of Chinese-style modernization in a win-win manner, sharing development opportunities and creating a better future together.
Only by following the right path can we achieve great things.
Let us, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and guided by the scientific thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era in the Xi Jinping era, adhere to the laws, persevere in our efforts, fully unleash our initiative, activeness, and creativity, and properly handle a series of major relationships, so that we can make great strides in the new journey of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in a modernized country.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) The Biden administration will add six Chinese entities to its blacklist this Friday (February 10) for their suspected involvement in the spy balloon program.
The U.S. Department of Commerce said that these five Chinese companies and one research institution help modernize the Chinese military, especially in aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
Companies on the blacklist have a hard time obtaining US technology exports.
The list is called the "entity list" and companies on it are not allowed to purchase technology or goods from US suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the US Department of Commerce.
The following companies have been blacklisted: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., the 48th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Eagle Gate Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhai Xiangyun Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Eagle Gate Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Prior to this, the White House indicated that it was considering taking broader measures to "expose and address" China's more extensive surveillance activities that threaten the national security of the United States.
The balloon incident has further escalated tensions between China and the United States, and US Secretary of State Blinken cancelled his visit to China.
On February 4, the United States shot down a balloon, and the Chinese government lodged a strong protest with the US Embassy in China, criticizing the United States for seriously undermining and damaging the efforts and progress of both sides to maintain stable Sino-US relations.
Based on the available wreckage evidence and information from the Chinese military's procurement platform, the US government concluded that the balloon's manufacturer "has direct ties to the Chinese People's Liberation Army," and is an approved supplier approved by the Chinese military.
On Friday's press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that the Chinese side has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position regarding the accidental entry of a Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle into US airspace due to force majeure.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, she added that the relevant resolutions of the US Congress are mere political manipulation and hype.
China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to this.
Matthew Axelrod, the assistant secretary of commerce in charge of export enforcement, said, "Today's action demonstrates our joint efforts to identify and prevent China from using spy balloons that violated the airspace of the United States and over 40 other countries."

Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhai Xingyun Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. said he was unaware of the sanctions and refused to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have yet to comment on these information.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) It has been several days since the earthquake struck parts of Turkey and Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is dwindling, but the rescuers were greatly relieved to find a family of five on Saturday.
According to the Associated Press, this five-member family was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days in Nurdai town, a severely affected area in Gaziantep province.
Rescue workers first pulled the mother and daughter out from the rubble, and then found the father, but he insisted that they save his son and another daughter first.
After they were all rescued, cheers erupted in the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were successfully rescued under adverse conditions of severe cold weather.
"What day is it today?
"—— The boy who was trapped for 129 hours under the rubble of the collapsed ruins asked the rescuers who brought him back to the surface to save him.
A man from Kahramanmaras holds his cat that was just rescued
The miraculous success of the rescue operation has brought a glimmer of hope to the originally hopeless search and rescue efforts, but at the same time, the number of casualties has continued to rise.
According to official statistics, more than 20,000 people have died in Turkey as a result of the Monday earthquake, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated to be over 3,500.
Although experts say that people can survive for more than a week after being trapped in the rubble, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly bleak.
Rescue workers are still using thermal imaging devices to search for signs of life beneath the rubble.
Meanwhile, the focus of rescue efforts began to shift towards helping those survivors who were in dire need of assistance.
UN officials: The disaster in the region is "unprecedented in a century"
Martin Griffiths, the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General in charge of humanitarian affairs, said at a press conference held in Turkey that the earthquake was "the worst disaster in the region in a century."
He also praised Turkey's post-disaster response efforts as "unusual."
He also told Reuters reporters that he hoped to provide aid to areas controlled by the Syrian government and the opposition, but also said that the situation was "still unclear."
The United Nations pledged to provide an additional 25 million US dollars in disaster relief to the people of Syria affected by the earthquake.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced that it would allocate $25 million to aid Turkey and Syria in disaster relief.

This earthquake was the first earthquake with a magnitude greater than 9 to be recorded in Japan since observations began.
About 22,000 people died in the disaster, and about 400,000 buildings were completely destroyed or collapsed.
The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant was affected by the earthquake and tsunami and suffered a leakage accident.
This accident was classified as the most serious 7th level in the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).
The Fukushima nuclear accident caused the detection of trace amounts of radioactive materials worldwide, including iodine-131, cesium-137 (half-life of 30 years), and others.
A large amount of radioactive isotopes was released into the Pacific as a result of the nuclear accident.
According to statistics from the United Nations, at least 870,000 people in the disaster areas of Syria and Turkey are in urgent need of food.
In Syria alone, more than 5.3 million people have lost their homes due to the earthquake.
The World Food Programme (WFP) has called for the allocation of US$77 million to provide food for the earthquake-displaced victims in Turkey and Syria.
At present, the temperature in the disaster area has dropped to below zero, and many victims have no place to live.
The Turkish government has distributed large amounts of hot meals, tents, and blankets, but these supplies are still difficult to deliver to many people in desperate need of help.
In Syria, which has been mired in civil war for a long 12 years, the earthquake has added insult to injury for the people's plight.
Within four days after the earthquake, the World Food Programme had provided food assistance to 115,000 people in Turkey and Syria.
The World Health Organization (WHO) sent 72 tons of medical supplies for treating wounds and performing emergency surgeries.

We must strive to master Marxism theory, our main weapon, and consciously use the Party's innovative theory to arm our minds, guide our practice, and drive our work. We must put in the effort to study, ponder, and practice, so that we can truly acquire a firm belief, absolute loyalty, and a sense of mission.
We must implement the decisions and deployments of the 20th CPC National Congress with an energetic and proactive spirit, solidly advance Chinese-style modernization, roll up our sleeves and work hard, and take on the role of "construction foreman" to turn blueprints into reality step by step.
We must always remember that comprehensive strict governance of the party is an unending journey, and that self-revolution of the party is an unending journey. We must firmly fulfill our political responsibilities for comprehensive strict governance of the party, and use political construction of the party as the guiding principle to advance the great cause of building the party in the new era.
We must strengthen our abilities to drive high-quality development, serve the people, and prevent and resolve risks, promote the spirit of investigation and research, and resolutely prevent and overcome formalism and bureaucracy.

Google AI chatbot "gives wrong answers" and the parent company's stock value evaporates over a billion US dollars
(Compiled on November 11)
Google's newly launched artificial intelligence chatbot Bard made a bad debut, "answering incorrectly" in a promotional video, which caused Alphabet, Google's parent company, to plummet by 8.9% on Wednesday and fall below the 100 US dollar mark, wiping out 110 billion US dollars (approximately 476.5 billion Malaysian ringgit) in market value. It closed at 94.57 US dollars on Friday.
The market is concerned that Alphabet is not as competitive as rival Microsoft.
According to a report by Reuters, Google released a promotional video for its AI chatbot Bard on social media earlier, in which someone asks Bard: "Can you tell me what new discoveries there are about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that I can tell my 9-year-old child about?"
Bard mentioned in his answer that the telescope had taken the first photo of an exoplanet outside the solar system.
However, according to data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States, the first photo of an extrasolar planet was taken by the "Very Large Telescope" of the European Southern Observatory in 2004.
Reuters reported the news under the headline "Bard's erroneous answer causes Alphabet stock to plummet."
On the other hand, Google pointed out that Bard's response "highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process," and that it will combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's responses "meet high standards in terms of quality, safety, and factual information."

From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totaled S$8.96 billion, and it is expected that the full-year tourism revenue in 2022 will reach S$138 billion to S$143 billion, which is six to seven times that of S$1.89 billion in 2021, and has already recovered to about 50% to 52% of the level before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019.
The Singaporean government has taken various measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced the allocation of nearly 5 billion ringgit to stimulate the tourism industry's recovery.
The tourism authority recently announced that it plans to allocate 110 million new ringgit from this budget over the next two years to launch more commercial and leisure activities to attract tourists back.
To make health and wellness one of Singapore's tourism highlights, the Singapore Tourism Board launched an expression of interest collection activity on November 23, 2022, to develop a health and wellness destination in the southern coast of Singapore.
Singapore Tourism Board's Executive Director of Sports and Wellness Tourism, Wang Lingli, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have put their health at the top of their considerations when planning a trip.
Developing a health and wellness destination in the Marina South area, which boasts the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Barrage, could contribute to Singapore's tourism and economy, allowing visitors to stay longer and spend more in Singapore.
Singapore Tourism Board chief Tan Kin Liang said that in the next few years, health and wellness will become an important component of Singapore's tourism products.
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
For this reason, the Tourism Bureau has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists over the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held the first Health and Wellness Festival, providing the public with over 130 health-related activities and experiences of various kinds.
Singapore will continue to provide new travel experiences for tourists.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, Avatar World in the Bayfront Garden, the Central Beach Market at Sentosa, the newly added "Exploring New Frontiers" exhibition hall at the Art Science Museum, and the newly built open-air theater at the Night Safari, the STB will support the development and upgrading of projects such as the Jurong Bird Park of the Wildlife Reserves Singapore, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will establish relevant industry standards for the sustainable development of the conference, exhibition, and incentive travel industries by the end of 2023. It will also focus on improving waste management and carbon emissions issues, further enhancing the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the airline industry.
Data shows that as of December 18, 2022, passenger traffic at Chek Lap Kok Airport has recovered strongly, with daily passenger arrivals exceeding 150,000 and weekly arrivals exceeding 1 million, which is equivalent to about 75% of the pre-COVID-19 level. The number of airline employees on duty has also recovered to about 90% of the pre-COVID-19 level.
Data shows that from January to October 2022, Singapore has welcomed 23.6 million tourists, which is equivalent to 42% of the pre-COVID-19 level, and handled 170,000 takeoff and landing flights, which is equivalent to 53% of the pre-COVID-19 level.
The tourism industry has recovered quickly, and has also driven the recovery of the accommodation, transportation, catering, and shopping industries.
The Singaporean government and the tourism industry are optimistic about the Chinese market.
Assistant Director of the International Division of the Singapore Tourism Board, Ko Su Dan, said that a survey by a Chinese travel platform showed that Singapore's safety index ranked among the top three in the world, which is one of the reasons why Chinese tourists love Singapore.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, about 3.6 million Chinese people traveled to Singapore for tourism and leisure each year.
As China eases its border policies, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists will recover to between 30% and 60% of the 2019 level this year.
Koo Sook-dan pointed out that next, the Tourism Bureau will closely monitor China's signals of further easing its outbound travel policies to respond to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with online travel platforms such as Ctrip and travel agencies in China, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to welcome Chinese tourists in response to new trends in outbound tourism from China.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that the industry will recover faster than expected as long as the global economy does not experience a significant downturn that affects the public's income, and as long as there are no new large-scale fatal pandemics.
Kim Jong-un and his daughter interact intimately, wife ignored on the side
(Compiled from reports on November 11) North Korea held a parade on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army on the evening of the 8th, and Kim Jong-un's daughter Kim Ju-ae not only attended but also stood on the podium with her father.
On the 9th, the North Korean official media released a video showing Kim Jong-un embracing her father and engaging in affectionate eye contact and whispered conversation multiple times. She gently caressed her father's cheeks with both hands, and even touched his chest. The footage of the father-daughter interaction was broadcast throughout the country.
However, First Lady Li Xue only had to step aside.
According to reports from South Korean media such as Chosun Ilbo, on the 7th, Kim Jong-un and Ri Sol-ju attended a banquet with their daughter Kim Ju-ae, who was seated in the C position between them in an official photo. The next day, on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, Kim Ju-ae also joined Kim Jong-un on the podium during the evening military parade. This was a rare sight.
After the parade, the official media of North Korea, Korean Central Television, released footage of the event, revealing more touching scenes of a father and daughter.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter multiple times from the podium, and their smiles never faded from their faces. They also whispered to each other, and at one point, Kim Jong-un even cupped his father's cheeks with both hands. Kim Jong-un also smiled broadly in response.
Other official media footage also showed that Kim Yo-jong was constantly touching her father's face with her hand when they sat on the sofa together, and when she and her father walked hand in hand, she touched his chest with her hand.
The First Lady Li Xue was only able to follow from behind or sit to the side throughout the event, always a few steps behind her husband and daughter.
According to Korean media, since the Mars-17 missile was first publicly tested on November 18 last year, the probability of its exposure has been increasing over the past three months, and it has now appeared for the fifth time in a formal setting.
The North Korean official media used the most affectionate terms such as "beloved children" and "noble children" to refer to Kim Jong-eun, and also aired footage of Kim Jong-eun repeatedly shouting his oath of loyalty to the white bloodline while overlooking the parade from the grandstand.
These signs have led the outside world to suspect whether Kim Jong-eui has already been designated as the successor to the Kim dynasty. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal from Kim Jong-un to put his teenage daughter in the position of successor to the throne," but there are also views that such a judgment is premature, given that Kim Jong-un has a son at his side. In such a situation, there are still various possibilities.
Qiangyang Q&A: How to view the US January non-farm employment data far exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
Q: How does Rongyang Investment view the US January non-farm employment data far exceeding expectations and the future trend?
A: On February 3, the US Labor Department released the employment data for January 2023 in the non-agricultural sector. The number of newly added non-agricultural jobs was 517,000, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest level in nearly 50 years; the hourly wage growth rate was 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, slightly slower than expected.
From a total perspective, this data is subject to a lot of one-time and technical factors, such as the return to work of striking teachers, the adjustment of survey and statistical scopes, the update of seasonal factors, and subsequent corrections (referring to the downward revision of the January 2022 non-farm employment increase from 50.4 million to 36.4 million). Non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data suggests.
From a structural perspective, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still present, but the proportion is relatively low; employment in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and healthcare has rebounded significantly, and data shows that there is still a labor shortage in the service sector.
Combining the strong rebound of the service sector PMI, job vacancies, and labor shortage data, as well as the robust consumer credit data, we judge that the US service sector has undergone a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that the tight labor market in the US employment market cannot be improved without a recession.
At present, there is still a supply gap of over 5 million in the US labor market, and labor participation is rising slowly, especially for the 25-54 age group, which is approaching the pre-pandemic high.
In addition, the strong excess savings and consumer credit of US residents will further delay the impact of contractionary policies on the labor market, given the strong consumption demand.
The tight supply and demand in the US labor market will be the underlying theme of the US economy in 2023.
Taking into account that interest rate hikes are nearing an end and inflation expectations keep fluctuating, we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Prior to the release of this data, the US stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets were overly optimistic about the Fed's path to raising interest rates.
As inflation data continues to improve, the Federal Reserve is not only shortening the pace of interest rate hikes, but also maintaining a delicate balance of market inflation expectations, while at the same time leaning toward a hawkish stance. However, the market ignores the Fed's hawkish statements, not only expecting an early end to interest rate hikes, but also expecting two rate cuts at the end of the year.
In the context of tight labor market supply and demand, with the impact of the tightening policy unclear, we believe that the Fed's indication to raise interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. The adjustment of the market's extreme expectations and the crowded trading may cause certain damage to the market.
Despite this, the stubbornly high wage growth is unlikely to reverse the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, as the M2 data turned negative year-on-year and the leading indicators of the CPI components gradually improved, and the US CPI data has turned to a phase of rapid decline since October. The persistent wage growth will only provide a floor for future inflation data, and the current market expectations are difficult to verify. The market may enter a new round of bargaining after the next round of inflation data is released.
Zeng Yonggang, the founder of Xiaoshan, passed away due to a sudden heart disease. He once led China's first apparel company in its transformation - Economic Observer - Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observer reporter Zheng Weixin on February 11 announced the death of Zeng Yonggang, the founder of Xunxun Enterprise and chairman of the board of directors of Xunxun Holdings (hereafter referred to as Xunxun Holdings), in a WeChat public account. Zeng died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to sudden cardiac arrest, despite emergency treatment. The certifying entity was Xunxun Holdings.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the general manager of the state-owned cotton spinning factory. As he was transferred, in 1989, Zheng Yonggang became the general manager of Ningbo Yonggang Clothing Factory, the predecessor of Xunxun Fashion.
In December 2022, at the 20th China Enterprise Leaders Summit and the 22nd China Future Star Enterprise Summit, Zeng Yonggang said in his speech that in the men's suit market in China in the 1990s, the market share of SENSU brand was as high as 37%.
In 1996, Xunxun Holdings (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in the Chinese garment industry.
Just when the clothing business was booming, the SANSAN Group began to transform itself, because Zeng Yonggang realized that "once the market opens up, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and SANSAN suits will not be able to maintain its leading position for a long time and become the national uniform of the Chinese people."
In 1999, Song Song began researching corporate transformation. Zeng Yonggang recalled at the time, "We came to Shanghai to find out what kind of transformation we should make, and we specifically invited many experts and scholars to hold a series of Zhuge Liang meetings and Wu Zhuo discussions."
Finally, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is big healthcare with a bright future.
After the strategic direction was determined, Song Song began to seek cooperation. At that time, the Anshan Institute of Heat Energy, which was affiliated with Anshan Iron and Steel Group and was conducting a national 863 project on carbon materials, had insufficient research funding, so Song Song and the Anshan Institute of Heat Energy Carbon Materials Research Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the 863 project "Middle Phase Carbon Microspheres", and to develop, produce, and sell negative electrode materials, thereby achieving the commercialization of negative electrode materials in China.
In 2001, Sanyuan Pharmaceutical achieved the industrial-scale production of middle-phase carbon microspheres, and began the process of domestic substitution, replacing Japan to become the main domestic supplier of middle-phase carbon microspheres.
This is China's first lithium-ion battery negative electrode material production enterprise, which has achieved the localization of negative electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries.
As lithium-ion batteries were rapidly adopted, Sunshine Group's lithium-ion battery business began to gradually expand. In 2007, the lithium-ion material business was included in Sunshine Group's main business, and the apparel business's revenue share gradually decreased year by year until 2013, when the revenue of the lithium-ion material business surpassed that of the apparel business.
In February 2021, Sinochem Holdings successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business and entered the LCD polarizer market. It also established Sino-Golden Optoelectronics, a polarizer company, which is a high-tech industry with a relatively high technical content. Sinochem's main competitors in this field are all among the world's top 500 companies, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, and Mitsubishi Electric.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management. "The success rate of Chinese private enterprises acquiring some high-tech companies overseas is relatively low. Why do these acquisitions fail?
Because everyone will consider the fact that I spent so much money, I should hire someone to manage it, which is a common practice. However, Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day that Shanshan successfully acquired Shanjin, Zheng Yonggang publicly announced at Shanjin Kangdian that Shanshan, as the major shareholder of Shanjin, had decided to implement the "one country, two systems" policy. In addition to Zheng Yonggang serving as the chairman of the board, Shanshan employees will not be assigned to Shanjin. Instead, they will operate under a delegated management system, with the existing distribution system, corporate culture, and management models remaining unchanged.
ICC Xinzhi News released the 2022 negative electrode data, showing that Sanyan's negative electrode shipped more than 200,000 tons in 2022, with a year-on-year increase of 100%, and a market share of 16%. Sanyan's artificial graphite negative electrode material once again topped the list.
According to Yano Research, the company's subsidiary Shin-Etsu Chemical's global market share in the polarizer business reached 29% in 2022, and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Xunxun's revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, and its net profit was 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, Xunxun's share price was 19.24 yuan per share, and its total market value was 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Sanxin shares stated on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's graphitization effective capacity would be approximately 100,000 tons, and the graphitization capacity of the Mianyang project was still in the ramp-up phase.
According to Wandian, Zeng Yonggang is still the chairman and the actual controller of Xunxun Parts at present.
According to Tianyancha, Zeng Yonggang holds a 40.1% stake in Sanyuan Holdings Co., Ltd.
The general manager of Xingxing Co., Ltd. is Li Zhihua, who was born in 1968. He has served as the chairman of Xingxing Battery Materials Co., Ltd. of Dongguan, Xingxing New Materials Technology Co., Ltd. of Ningbo, Xingxing Energy Technology Co., Ltd. of Hunan, and the deputy general manager of Xingxing Co., Ltd. of Ningbo.
On February 10, Xuanxuan Pharmaceutical stated on the investor interaction platform that there are no familial relationships between the senior management of the company and the actual controller of the company.
"Fund E Account" is here: The CSRC has authorized its development. Investors can now consolidate and query all their fund holdings in one place - Economic Observer - Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observer reporter Chen Wan: Is it difficult to collect account information due to the complex fund purchase channels?
Are you always forgetting the "little treasure chest"?
The issues of the common people are about to be resolved.
On February 10, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that the "Fund E Account" APP had been listed in all mobile application stores and was open for public trial operation.
It is reported that "Fund E Account" provides a "one-stop" query service for individual investors to obtain information on public fund accounts and shares, aiming to solve the industry service pain points such as forgetting accounts and complicated queries for the majority of small and medium-sized investors.
According to Wind data, as of the end of 2022, there were 156 fund management companies in China, managing a total fund size of approximately 2.6 trillion yuan. There were 167 fund share registration institutions and 411 fund sales institutions.
The account systems of the various share registration institutions are independent of each other and lack a unified industry-wide query channel.
Industry insiders have said that by the end of 2021, more than 720 million people in China were fund investors, which means that half of the population in the country invested in fund products.
Previously, investors had to check purchase information through different sales agencies. Now, through the "Fund E Account", they can check the purchase information of all sales channels, and the fund holdings are clear at a glance.
What is the "Fund E Account" APP?
According to related documents, the "Fund E Account" APP is a mobile application developed and built by China Clearing Intermediary under the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission for the public fund industry, which provides investors with a one-stop query service for their holdings of public fund products outside the market.
Investors can conveniently and quickly obtain information about their holdings of publicly offered fund products managed by different fund managers through all sales channels in the market via the "Fund E Account". This will significantly improve the efficiency of inquiries.
Specifically, the information that investors can obtain through the "Fund E Account" includes: information on fund accounts opened with fund managers across the entire market, information on trading accounts opened with fund sales agencies, and information on the holdings of collective asset management plans that are not subject to a 200-person limit, such as open-ended mutual funds and securities company-managed investment plans.
Liu Yiqian, the head of business at Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told Economic Observer reporters that investors can use the "Fund E Account" app to get a one-stop view of all their off-exchange public fund holdings, helping them recover "forgotten assets," and more importantly, the app enables the collection of comprehensive fund investment information across all accounts, helping investors get a more timely, accurate, and complete picture of their investment status, so that they can better optimize their fund portfolio allocation and better plan their financial arrangements.
How do I register and use it?
Reporters noted that at present, the "Fund E Account" APP has been listed in the application stores of Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, and vivo, but the APP is still in the public trial operation phase. To register, users need to enter an invitation code, and investors can contact the fund managers of the funds they hold to obtain one.
A customer service representative of a large-scale publicly-traded fund in Shanghai provided a six-digit invitation code to an Economic Observer reporter, and told the reporter, "During the trial operation phase of the APP, China Clearing provides a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager, which investors can obtain by calling us. We will provide them all.
After the trial operation is completed, users will no longer need an invitation code to register.

The reporter registered an account and completed the query by downloading and using the relevant documents on the website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) related to the "Fund E Account", which took only a few minutes. The process was divided into four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund query.
After completing the step of real-name authentication, click the "Asset" button to bind the fund, and all fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms will be displayed in the list of binding options (accounts that can be bound) and can then be bound. After binding, the reporter will be able to see the total assets of the funds invested and start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the "Fund E Account" only provides investors with query services and does not allow for redemption or purchase transactions.
The "Fund E Account" data displayed is generally three trading days prior to the date the user performs the query (T day).
For example, if you open the "Fund E Account" on February 10, the total assets, fund shares, and fund net asset value displayed on the Assets page correspond to the date three trading days prior, which is February 7.

US, Japan, and the Philippines Reach Defense Consensus to Counter the CCP
Asia - On February 9, Philippine President Marcos (Bongbong Marcos) visited Japan to meet with Prime Minister Kishida Fumio.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing China's invasion of the South China Sea and East China Sea, and the Philippine leaders issued a joint statement after the meeting, stating that they would engage in substantive defense exchanges by signing a trilateral defense agreement with the United States, and oppose China's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media reports, Kishida Fumio hopes to use this meeting to help the two countries establish policies to deal with the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Xiao Ma Kou Si visited China at the beginning of this year and obtained an agreement worth 20 billion US dollars.
However, after that, the Sino-Philippine relations did not improve, but rather deteriorated.
At the beginning of this month, the Philippines and the United States signed an agreement to open more bases to the US military to ensure the security of the South China Sea.
The newly added base is located 300 kilometers from Taiwan and is also the closest point to China.
If a crisis occurs in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations from bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that now Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines are forming an axis with the United States to build a "counter-CPEC arc" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
KMT Vice Chairman Xia Lizhen Delivers a Message from Song Tao: Welcome the Green Camp to Visit the Mainland under the 1992 Consensus
This time, Hsia Li-yüan, Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang of Taiwan, first met with Song Tao, Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and then with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China.
Yao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the KMT-affiliated National Policy Foundation, was interviewed by Taiwan Central News Agency last night, and gave a positive assessment of Song Tao's remarks about Xia Lizhen, saying that as long as one adheres to the "1992 Consensus" and is anti-Taiwan independence, China welcomes visits from members of the green camp.
The Nationalist Party considered it to be a fresh idea.
Xia Lizhen met with Song Tao earlier today, and the news of that day did not mention this statement.
The ruling DPP in Taiwan has repeatedly clarified its rejection of the "1992 Consensus."
According to Central News Agency today, Kuomintang Vice Chairman Hsia Li-yün led a delegation to visit the mainland, and during his stay in Beijing, he met separately with Politburo Standing Committee member Wang Huning of the Communist Party of China, the new head of the Taiwan Affairs Office, Song Tao, and Beijing Municipal Committee Secretary-General Yin Li.
Xia Liyuan met with Song Tao and discussed the political foundation of the KMT and CPC as being "the 1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the KMT's National Policy Foundation, then stated at the meeting that the KMT's "1992 Consensus" is the original "1992 Consensus" in its purest form.
Zhao Chunsan analyzed that this was different from the previous few conferences he attended.
In recent video conferences with scholars on the mainland, as well as this one, I have not heard any mention of unification by force or the "anti-secession law" in relation to Taiwan. Instead, the focus has been on restoring communication and dialogue.
Zhao Chunsan pointed out that cross-Strait relations are fraught with danger and hostility, and that the mainland hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the KMT and the CCP, the other side is still willing to do a good job in serving Taiwanese people, which represents their desire not to worsen cross-Strait relations.
According to Zhao Chunsan, Wang Huning also gave instructions personally to Song Tao to tell him, "You must definitely implement their (Taiwan's farmers and fishermen) demands. If it cannot be resolved comprehensively, it should be handled on a case-by-case basis."
The report did not mention whether the KMT delegation mentioned the daily harassment of Taiwan by Chinese military aircraft and warships, the agricultural and fisheries issues in some minor counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether the Central News Agency reporter asked questions about such issues during the interview.
The French labor union has again mobilized a large march against the government's pension reform plan
On Saturday (February 11), French unions launched a nationwide mobilization against the government's pension reform proposal, calling on the public to take to the streets to express their views.
This is the fourth day of action against the government's pension reform proposal.
The number of people who respond to the call of the rally may affect the union groups' next course of action.
This is the fourth time in a month that the eight major French union groups have jointly launched a nationwide mobilization, and the first time that the protest activities have been scheduled for Saturday.
Given that for most French people Saturday is a day off, they do not need to choose between participating in a protest demonstration or going on strike, trade union groups hope that today's rally will attract more people to participate.
Today, the unions of the public transportation system, the metro, and the state-owned railway companies did not call for their employees to go on strike. The public transportation system should be able to operate normally, and citizens can take the bus to the rally site. In areas where schools are starting winter break, people can go on vacation as usual.
Union groups hope that more than one million people will attend the rally today, while the expected national participation rate may be between 600,000 and 800,000, and the Paris metropolitan area may gather between 90,000 and 120,000 people.
Since the start of the protests against the government's pension reform plan, which aims to raise the official retirement age from the current 62 to 64, opinion polls have shown that most French people are not in favor of the measure. However, the number of people who have actually taken to the streets to participate in demonstrations has gradually decreased.
The first strike and protest activity on January 31 mobilized 1.27 million to 2.5 million people across the country.
The protest crowd this Tuesday (February 7) has already shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million people nationwide.
The pension reform plan is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially those led by the radical left, submitted countless amendment proposals, which slowed down the deliberation process considerably.
The debate between the ruling party and the opposition is becoming increasingly fierce and sharp-edged.
Recently, a member of the French Radical Left Party, La France Insoumise, posted a photo of himself stepping on a balloon printed with the image of the Labor Minister on social media, triggering protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly finally announced that the member of parliament would be banned from participating in parliamentary activities for 15 days as a punishment for this behavior.
Although this reform proposal has triggered the largest social upheaval in France in the past 20-plus years, so far the government has only made slight adjustments to the draft and has not made any major concessions.
The union is planning to launch another action next Thursday, on the 16th, and also on March 7, when the reform draft is submitted to the Senate for discussion, the union plans to organize protest actions.
China encourages higher birth rates, solicits sperm donations at universities with high standards
On the 9th, the Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province in China launched a promotional campaign to recruit university graduates or students to donate sperm, with a reward of RMB4,500 for those who successfully donate eight to twelve times.
According to a report by Taiwanese media today, the message shot to the top of Weibo's hot search list on the same day, and triggered many provinces and cities, including Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Beijing, to follow suit with their own initiatives.
According to a report signed by the Liberty Times, China encourages university students to donate sperm.
The donation of sperm by universities across the country has different requirements, with the highest threshold in Beijing. In addition to academic qualifications, applicants must also be at least 170 cm tall, have a well-proportioned face, no obvious baldness, and no more than 600 degrees of myopia.
According to the report, the Yunnan Human Sperm Bank pointed out that donors can receive a comprehensive male health check worth 1,000 yuan, "especially for sperm and chromosome testing, most people have never done it, which is of great significance for understanding their fertility status."
The donor requirements include being at least 165 cm tall, having a college degree or higher, or currently enrolled in school, being free of genetic diseases and infectious diseases such as color blindness and hepatitis B, etc.
According to a report, the Shaanxi Human Sperm Bank has posters with the slogan "Paid Sperm Donation, Unlimited Glory" and calls on young people to respond to sperm donation and encourages netizens to forward related information to "spread love."
In Shaanxi Province, the price is higher than in Yunnan, and qualified donors can receive RMB300 in cash each time. Those who complete a certain number of donations can receive a RMB5,000 subsidy.
Currently, the highest price tag is in Beijing, with the highest subsidy of 5,150 yuan.
The last East German Communist Party Prime Minister has died
The successor to the East German Communist Party reported in a statement that "last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95." The statement was issued by the party.
Therefore, our party lost an important leader.

On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall was opened, separating East Berlin and West Berlin for 28 years, Modrow said he would help turn East Germany into a democratic country.
At that time, due to the protesters in East Germany demanding democracy and freedom, the Communist Party leaders were forced to step down.
After Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union, he called for reforms in Eastern Europe, which was under Soviet domination.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free election in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led to him no longer serving as prime minister.
Although Modrow carried out reforms, his opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and unification that occurred in October 1990.
He was also criticized for trying to reform rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modro was convicted of electoral fraud in the municipal elections of May 1989, but did not go to prison.
These accusations are said to be politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modrow continued to serve in the German parliament, and from 1999 to 2004, he served as a member of the European Parliament.
Modero sees himself as a reformer and hopes to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want East Germany to return, but that its achievements should be acknowledged.
Modrow was born in the German town Jasenitz (now Jasienica in Poland) in 1928, and received training as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a platoon leader in the youth fire brigade, and became a member of the Nazi militia organization Volkssturm when the conflict was nearing its end, which called up men aged 16 to 60 for the final struggle.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by the Soviet army and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war. There, he participated in anti-fascist courses and became a staunch communist party member.
In 1949, the year East Germany was founded, he found a job as a mechanical engineer after returning home, and continued to study social sciences and economics, earning a doctorate.
Modrow was a member of the staff of the Free German Youth Movement, and almost all young people in East Germany joined the movement. He was promoted to the chairman of the Dresden regional branch of the governing Socialist Unity Party (SED) from 1973 to 1989.
He also served in the East German parliament for more than 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state position.
Iran commemorates revolution anniversary; Hackers interrupt the president's TV speech in support of protests
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official ceremony on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted a televised speech by President Ebrahim Raisi.
The president's live television speech was interrupted for about one minute on the Internet, and a symbol of hackers against the Iranian government appeared on the screen, with their name "Edalat Ali (Justice Ali)".
There was also a voice shouting "Down with the Islamic Republic."
According to a report by Reuters today, hackers interrupted the national television broadcast to commemorate the anniversary of the revolution.
Iranian officials commemorated the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, and the hardline government in Rasht faced the boldest challenge from young protesters demanding their ouster, but Rasht still called on the "deceived youth" to repent so that they could be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader.
Protests have continued to sweep across Iran nationwide since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September after being detained by the country's morality police.
Iranian security forces have carried out a deadly crackdown on protests, which is one of the most significant challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since the 1979 revolution overthrew 2,500 years of monarchy.
As part of the anniversary amnesty marking the revolution, the Iranian authorities released on Friday the imprisoned dissidents Fahad Meshami and Fariba Adelkhah, who had been on a hunger strike to protest their different political views.
Earlier, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a general amnesty, which included some prisoners who had been arrested in the recent anti-government protests.
According to the human rights organization HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors.
The report also states that 70 government security personnel were beaten to death.
It is believed that up to 19,763 protesters were arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been calling for voting to take place at the Saturday rally to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On Friday night, during the anniversary celebrations of the Iranian Revolution, official media showed fireworks as part of government-sponsored festivities, and people chanted "Allahu Akbar!"
(God is the greatest!)"
However, one can also hear many people shouting "Dictators must die!" at the rally.
and the "Death of the Islamic Republic" video posted on social media.
On Saturday, the government television channel broadcast live footage of official gatherings in all the states.
In Tehran, as part of official celebrations, a display of domestically produced ballistic missiles, drones, submarine hunting cruisers, and other military equipment was presented.
The speeches of President Lacey are often interrupted by the slogan "America, go to hell"—a signature slogan at state conventions.
The crowd also chanted "Death to Israel."
Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French citizens who have been detained in Iran, and is one of the factors contributing to the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran over the past few months, Reuters said.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on charges of national security violations.
They later confined her to house arrest, but in January she was back in prison.
Adelkhah denied these accusations.
A week before Mousavi's release, his supporters warned that he faced the risk of death due to his hunger strike protest.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the mandatory wearing of headscarves.
On Friday, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the release of Adelkhah by calling for the restoration of her freedom, including allowing her to return to France if she so wishes.

Did the balloon incident sharpen the eyes of the United States?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal today, the United States is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China after the balloon incident.
Current and former security officials have said that the balloon incident highlights the national security threats posed by China and will help gain more political support for strengthening U.S. technology protection.
The United States claimed that the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence collection and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior official at the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States who currently serves at the New America Security Center in Washington, D.C., this is the case.
"This undoubtedly adds fuel to the fire and supports the hardline view on China."
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday that "we will also consider taking broader action to expose and counter China's more widespread surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security and to our allies and partners."
U.S. officials said they have reported the balloon incident to the governments of more than 30 countries, and international coordination is crucial in addressing the threat from China.
Emily Benso, a senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in addition to the actions taken by the Biden administration, the newly established U.S.-China Strategic Competition Special Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives may also pressure the United States to take more stringent measures to slow down China's development.
She said that members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a more hardline stance, which may in turn force the White House to adopt more hardline policies.
The Wall Street Journal reported that many people who advocate stricter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of these controls to include artificial intelligence and other industries.
The US government is also drafting an investment review plan for overseas investments, to assess whether US investments abroad pose potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls to speed up the rollout of the plan.
Rescue efforts continue day and night after the Sino-Tibetan earthquake
Since the strong earthquake struck Turkey and the adjacent Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working tirelessly day and night in the rubble of thousands of buildings destroyed by the quake to rescue survivors buried under the debris.
In the cold temperatures, they often call for silence, as they desperately try to hear any signs of life from the broken concrete piles, hoping to remain quiet.
According to a report by Reuters today, two more women were rescued after surviving for several days in the rubble of the earthquake.
However, the number of deaths caused by the earthquake has risen to 24,150.
Turkey had 20,665 deaths, and the number of deaths in Syria exceeded 3,500.
The 7.8-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Monday continued to cause strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, making it the seventh deadliest natural disaster of this century, surpassing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similar strong earthquake that occurred in the northwestern part of Turkey in 1999 caused the deaths of more than 17,000 people.
The Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women were trapped for 122 hours after the most deadly earthquake in the region in 20 years, and that rescue workers rescued them from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey.
The other injured man, who is 55 years old, has been confirmed as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in the largest city in Turkey's southeast, Diyarbakir.
In the cold temperatures, rescuers often call for silence, as they desperately try to hear any signs of life from the rubble of the dilapidated concrete pile.
In the Samandag district of Turkey, rescue workers crouched under the concrete slabs, whispering "Inshallah" - "God willing" - as they carefully stretched their hands into the rubble to rescue a 10-day-old infant.
He opened his eyes wide, and the baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to the battlefield hospital.
Video footage shows that the paramedics also took away his mother, who was dizzy and nauseous on the stretcher, with a pale face but a clear mind.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people were rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, and that a total of 31,000 rescue workers were deployed in the affected areas.
He said that about 80,000 people were receiving treatment in hospitals, and 1.05 million people were homeless due to the earthquake and were crammed into temporary shelters.
As many people lack food in the cold winter conditions, the public is increasingly questioning the responses of the leaders of the two countries to the disaster relief.
According to Syrian official media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma went to a hospital in Aleppo together, reportedly the first time he has visited a disaster area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said that due to the complexities of relief work in a war zone, its stocks in Syria's northwest, which is controlled by rebel forces, were almost depleted.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey's Adiyaman province, where he admitted that the government's response had not reached the expected speed.
Opponents have seized on this issue to attack Erdoğan, who will run for re-election in the vote scheduled for May 14, but which may be postponed due to the disaster.
Reuters said that the anger over the delay in providing aid and the delay in launching rescue operations may affect the election.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was considered to be the most serious challenge to Erdoğan's rule in the twenty years since he came to power.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called "negative activities carried out for political purposes."
The leader of the main opposition party in Turkey, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, criticized the government's response.
Critics say, "The earthquake was very big, but what is even more serious is the lack of coordination, lack of planning, and incompetence."

VNA Hanoi - VNA correspondents report that on February 11 morning, during his visit to Brunei Darussalam, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD), also known as the University of Brunei.
Universiti Brunei Darussalam is the largest higher education and scientific research center in Brunei and ranks third in the local university rankings.
Universiti Brunei Darussalam is one of the symbols of Vietnam and Brunei's cooperation in education and training.
In July 2013, Universiti Brunei Darussalam officially established a partnership with FPT University in Vietnam, with English training as the main area of cooperation.
In addition to English, French, German, Japanese, and Korean as foreign languages, Universiti Brunei Darussalam also includes Vietnamese in its curriculum.
During his visit to the University of Brunei Darussalam, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife interacted with Vietnamese language students.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh is pleased to see that more and more foreigners are interested in learning Vietnamese, which will contribute positively to the promotion of Vietnamese culture and way of life to the world.
Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin believes and hopes that the Vietnamese language teaching team at the University of Brunei Darussalam will become increasingly strong; the students of the Vietnamese language classes will become more and more interested in Vietnamese and will strive to learn it well, so that they can soon use fluent Vietnamese and become ambassadors for the friendly and cooperative relations between Vietnam and Brunei.
During this opportunity, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also communicated with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Center in Long An City via video, to understand their learning situation, especially during the pandemic.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh believes that the partnership between Vietnam FPT University and the University of Brunei Darussalam, especially the FPT-UBD Global Center, is a vivid symbol of the educational cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
At the same time, we hope that the students of the center will make greater progress in their studies and contribute positively to the friendly and cooperative relations between Vietnam and China.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly praised the achievements made by the two countries in education cooperation during his discussions with the Minister of Education of Brunei and the leaders of the University of Brunei, including the cooperation between FPT University and the University of Brunei, and the initiative to include Vietnamese as a teaching language at the university.
Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin hopes that Universiti Brunei Darussalam will continue to focus on ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expand the scale of Vietnamese language classes.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc also highly praised the positive results achieved through cooperation based on the Education Cooperation Memorandum of Understanding signed by the two countries in April 2014, and suggested that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs, such as the Global Discovery Programme and Discovery Year.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly praised the establishment of the first overseas campus of the University of Brunei Darussalam in Vietnam, believing that the university's development scale in the region and the world will become increasingly powerful; and will further expand its cooperation with Vietnamese higher education institutions.
During this opportunity, Prime Minister Van Mierlo and his wife planted a memorial tree in the campus of Universiti Brunei Darussalam, and left a message in the guestbook.
Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin wished that Universiti Brunei Darussalam would continue to move forward and contribute an ever-increasing force to Brunei's education sector, and that it would also engage in deeper and broader cooperation with Vietnamese educational and training institutions.

Vietnam News Agency
VNA Hanoi - VNA correspondents report that the official visits of Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc and his wife to Singapore and Brunei were a complete success, and yielded comprehensive, practical, and concrete results.
Within three days of visiting Singapore and Brunei, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao participated in more than 30 different activities.
The achievements made have injected new impetus into the continuous development of the strategic partnership and comprehensive partnership between Vietnam and China, towards a deeper, wider, and more effective direction.
During his visits to the two countries, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh continued to reiterate Vietnam's foreign policy, which is independent, diverse, multifaceted, and flexible, and aims to be a good friend and reliable partner to all countries and a responsible member of the international community.
Strengthening relations with Singapore and Brunei is a need for both countries, and is aimed at improving the well-being of their respective peoples, and promoting peace, stability, and development in the region and the world.
During all the meetings and talks, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh agreed with the leaders of Singapore and Brunei on the need to continuously strengthen political trust with Vietnam through the exchange of high-level delegations, the effective implementation of various bilateral cooperation mechanisms and important cooperation agreements, etc.
Many cooperation documents were signed during this visit.
Among them, the "Understanding on Green and Digital Economy Partnership between Singapore and Vietnam" and the "Action Plan for Enhancing Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between Vietnam and Brunei for the 2023-2027 Period" are two highlights.

During his visits to the two countries, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh always made time to visit and listen to the thoughts and wishes of the Vietnamese community living there.
During the meeting between the leaders of the two countries, Prime Minister Van Minh Phung suggested that the authorities of both countries should pay more attention to this issue, and create favorable conditions for the fair treatment of the Vietnamese community in the local area, so that they can contribute to the local society and nurture the relationship between the two countries.
Both leaders of the two countries have approved and supported these recommendations.
In particular, Prime Minister Van Minh also shared with the leaders of the two countries the desire for a united, peaceful, stable, and prosperous ASEAN community; they unanimously agreed to maintain unity and cooperation with ASEAN member states and enhance ASEAN's central role in the region and international situation, which is complex and volatile.
Based on the important achievements obtained, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc's official visits to Singapore and Brunei for the purpose of strengthening relations with ASEAN neighboring countries in accordance with the Party Central Committee's 12th Conclusion on Overseas Vietnamese Work in the New Situation (12-KL/TW), and the mobilization of the nation's unified strength, have made positive contributions to the effective implementation of the Party's priority foreign policy of strengthening ties with neighboring countries.

What was the "object" that was shot down in the Alaskan sky?
The situation is confusing and speculation abounds
On Friday afternoon (February 10), the US military again used the most advanced stealth fighter jet F-22 to shoot down an unidentified object flying over the skies of Alaska in the United States.
The crash site was ten miles from the Alaskan coast.
This is the second time in less than a week that the US military has shot down an aerial object in the air.
Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China drifted in the airspace of the United States for several days before being shot down in the skies near the coast of South Carolina.
The Pentagon said that the second object was first entered into U.S. airspace on Thursday night, and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved across the northeast of Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), about the size of a small car, much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.
The Pentagon also believes that there is no evidence to suggest that the object is controllable.
On Friday, John Coby, the National Security Council's Strategic Communications Coordinator at the White House, said that while the exact shape of the object flying at high altitude is still unclear, it "constitutes a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."
Kobe said that this object is different from the spy balloon discovered within the United States, as it did not have "payload" hanging from it.
Kobe said, "We call it a 'thing' because it is the best description we can make at the moment."
President Biden consulted the Pentagon before ordering the downing of the object, and he made the decision "very carefully," Kobie added.
The U.S. official description of this object can be roughly summarized as follows: It is about the size of a small car, has no control stick, and has no suspension system. It flies at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.
However, these pieces of information are still unable to answer basic questions, such as what the object is, which country it belongs to, and what its mission is.
Currently, there are many online analyses and speculations that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It may be from China, just like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, and it may be performing a different mission at different locations.
Some people also linked this "object" in Alaska to "unidentified flying objects" (UFOs).
The report by US News & World Report quoted former US Congressman Peter Meijer's tweet on Friday saying, "I really hope this 'unidentified flying object' is a spy balloon rather than a legitimate UFO."
"The irony of equating an alien spaceship with a weather balloon is quite surprising, but it's not worth starting an interstellar war over it," Majer said.
Majer posted this tweet shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said that Magee was not the only one to suspect that the object was a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Congressman Tim Burchett criticized the government's cover-up of intelligence last month and called on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release reports on "unidentified flying objects."
Amazon's customer service left me in disbelief
Few people are likely to see this, but I also need to say something about it.
The shirt we bought at the time was a pullover with a zipper, but in the end, it was given to me as a short-sleeved shirt.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer service and confirmed that the clothes were still in stock at that time. I requested an exchange, and the customer service said they would take care of it and then immediately saw that the product name had changed to short sleeves, which turned out to be because the link I bought had been taken down.
Next, the customer service representative informed me that I could either keep the product and receive compensation for a certain amount, or return it.
This is how Amazon handles it?
It's really hard to believe that the wrong item of clothing wasn't my problem in the first place. As a consumer, I demand to receive the goods I'm entitled to, and I didn't make any unreasonable requests. Amazon, however, changed the name and said there was no inventory.
This is my first long review, and I hope it won't be my last.
Incomprehensible sleeves
It is said to be made of leather, and it is indeed quite hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks in the local area, and it is hard to tell whether it is real leather or not. Moreover, the sleeves of this garment are really incomprehensible. The sleeves of a jacket are usually longer than the body, but they are usually only 1-2 centimeters longer, while this garment is a full 5 centimeters longer. The arms should naturally hang down, but the sleeves of this garment cover the palm of the hand.
Buying clothes is easy, and returning them is also easy.
But when will we get our money back?
The workmanship of the clothes is quite good, but because the fit is a bit small, I had to return them. However, more than a week has passed since I returned them, and I still haven't received a refund?
Moreover, the buyer had to contact the untrustworthy SF Express themselves, which was the worst shopping experience since buying from Amazon!
However, the store is still not bad. They actively cooperated with us to urge the courier to make a timely refund, but the real work of this Qifeng courier is quite infuriating. It took about half a month to make the refund, which is a partner that drags Amazon's feet. Their work efficiency is poor and they have no sense of service!
It is more suitable for young people.
99 seconds to kill.
The workmanship, color, and feel of the woolen trousers are all good. They are soft and not too thick or thin, and there is no petroleum smell.
Unfortunately, the cut is slim-fitting, more suitable for young people.
3XL, waist circumference 2 feet 5 inches, stretched to 4 feet, 1.79/80 kg wearing it feels a bit tight around the waist.
It seems there is no adjustable belt at the waist, and it is quite difficult to loosen the waistband a bit.
Also, wearing tight clothes is uncomfortable.
It's good. The colors are not very vibrant
The price has gone up by more than 200 just after I bought it. What's going on?
This is the first time I used the cooperative Taodao Express, and the first time the delivery was not at home. Later, I proactively contacted the courier twice to arrange the delivery time, but the courier never showed up. Later, they directly returned the goods to me, and the courier had no integrity at all. I strongly recommend that you do not use Taodao Express anymore.
This time, I also returned a sympathy shirt, and the price has gone up by more than a hundred yuan since then.
Amazon should not sell such products under its own brand
When the product is on special offer, buy it. The price is not low, but the product is very good, and the reviews are also very good.
When I actually received the product, I was stunned and speechless. The product surface was severely scratched, and there were scratches in many other places. It was either a defective product or an old one, as shown in the picture below.
I requested a refund, and the manufacturer's representative said it was caused by transportation after seeing the pictures. Isn't that nonsense?
How can the goods inside possibly wear out?
There are only two possibilities: either it's a defective or old item, or I deliberately damage the item and then return it.
Objectively speaking, I don't have evidence to prove that I didn't damage the product, but based on my Amazon shopping credit record, I believe that such a product should not appear in Amazon's own-brand products. Customers choose Amazon's own-brand products because they trust it, customer win, we win, the customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory, and I hope we can all work together to improve. Thank you.
I have been using the product for less than a year and have already had two E2 errors, I don't know how to handle this?
I purchased the product on July 30, 2015, but the two groups on the right side of the receiver often showed red E2 in March 2016, which must be due to a problem with the transmitter module. This is not consistent with the Amazon website saying that the transmitter module can work continuously for seven years, and there is no after-sales service on the Amazon website, so I don't know what to do now?
Okay, I guess
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn't feel like a new one.
The label on the box has been torn off, and the label on the body of the device is also broken.
And it keeps freezing up.
It's better now that I've changed it.
The exchange was quite quick, it was a bit blurry at night, the field of view is not very wide, but it is sufficient for ordinary home use.
The shortcoming is that there is no card, which I bought myself, and the other is that I bought a phone from Amazon before.
There will be a sticker on the packaging to prevent it from being opened, but this time there wasn't one. There was also a sticker similar to the one on the phone box when you buy the phone, which you can stick on the warranty card, but this time there wasn't one.
I don't know if it's because the stuff is cheaper now, but I'm very confused.
Waiting for the supplier to respond
The packaging has no identifying marks, so I called the supplier directly and said that the lack of identifying marks meant it was genuine. If you have any doubts, you can send a sample of the packaging waste to Johnson & Johnson for inspection, and leave your license plate number and phone number. I promised to send a text message to inform them that I had entered my information into the Johnson & Johnson warranty card on their website, but I haven't received a text message yet?
In the morning, we received engine oil, and in the afternoon we replaced it.
Second purchase.
Amazon's own products are still quite reliable.
The oil change master said the oil was clear and clean, and it was indeed good oil.
Because it was the second time I bought it.
So I feel quite confident.
Delivery is fast, and there is nothing to complain about the packaging. Using this oil, the engine noise has clearly decreased.
The price-performance ratio is good, and it is hard to find synthetic engine oil for less than $200.

Japanese Amazon caused buyers' interests to be severely damaged due to customer service issues (8cm of caterpillars were delivered as 8c caterpillars) (8c = 14cm, 8cm = 2c).
They acknowledged the error, but continued to evade the issue, always stressing that the goods belonged to a third party and that the third party could not be constrained.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
When I purchased the page size option, it was 7c, 8, 9c. At the time, I thought it was a trap, so I called the Japanese-language customer service at Daiso and explicitly informed them that 8 was 8c, but when the goods arrived in China, I found that it was only 8cm. I think this was a deliberate trap set up to cheat Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service), and now the option is no longer available on the page.
The Chinese customer service: I am very sorry to have caused you losses. Here are two options for you to choose from:
1, you return the goods, and the buyer bears all the shipping costs.
2, if you do not return the item, we will compensate you with 1,000 yen.
(I calculate the cost. The shoes are more than 4,000 yen, which is about 200 RMB. Choice 1, I have no shoes, and I lose 200 yuan.
Choose option 2, I had shoes, and I was compensated 2,000 yen in the end. The final loss was 150 RMB. Customer service: We have recorded this, and we will deal with it seriously. The next day, I received an email saying that I did not accept the Chinese customer service's mediation, and that was the end of it.
I proposed: When there are options like 7c, 8c, and 9c, which are confusing to choose from, the Chinese customer service helped me by telling me that in Japan, the commonly used codes do not have a "c" at the end, such as 140, but have you gone to other spam pages to check?
There are cases where both American and Japanese codes are mixed together.
Furthermore, why do you put the 8cm size in between the 7cm and 9cm sizes, when it is the smallest size? What does it mean to put it there?
The Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese-language service, but we don't know if you want to bring the goods back to your country, so the shipping fee is not covered by insurance.
I don't understand this logic either, I'm Japanese, and I need Chinese customer service, and the Chinese living in Japan also don't need Chinese customer service. Visitors to Japan don't have the time or energy to make international long-distance calls, so then the question arises, who needs to call Amazon's overseas shopping customer service in Chinese? It's only people like me who shop on Amazon Japan.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just there to make life easier for us cross-border shoppers?
This purchase was not very satisfactory
This is the second time I have purchased Pampers diapers from Amazon. The first time was when my baby was two months old, and I bought a box of diapers made with European-imported paper. I was reasonably satisfied with my first purchase experience, and my baby did indeed use just one diaper all night long, which can indeed last for 12 hours without being changed.
However, when I bought the L-size diapers this time, there were two packages separately packaged in a box. After opening them, I felt that the paper was looser than that of the imported Pampers. There was a significant difference between the two. After using it for the baby, it was still acceptable. There were no signs of leaks or rashes.
However, after the second diaper change, a red rash appeared on the baby's inner thigh immediately after starting to use the diaper, and it has not disappeared to this day.
I doubt the quality of the two bags in one box. They are not the same.
I probably won't buy it again in the future!
Hope to pay more attention to the protection of package transportation
This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen since I started online shopping. There was no protection whatsoever, no cushioning foam, no protective packaging materials, nothing.
Just a box that has been deformed under pressure.
Moreover, the soft gel packaging inside has been crushed and the cardboard box has been crushed and deformed.
I hope it's the genuine article, and the quality is guaranteed. I won't dare to buy anything from the Amazon again in the future.
I would rather pay double the price domestically and have some guarantee.
Moreover, the product packaging issue has been commented on since 2016, and it's still the same now in 2019.
This shows that Amazon does not care about customer feedback at all, and is far behind domestic companies such as JD.com and Tmall.
It looks good, but there is a little bit of disappointment
I really like the color of the entire cup, which is a vibrant orange. Although we have a boy, I still think that the combination of orange and yellow is eye-catching.
Smaller than I imagined, but it's still acceptable since it's meant to be carried outdoors.
Last night, I tried it out at home and found that the distance between the straw and the cap was too close after the cap was pushed open. Since the straw is positioned vertically in the upward direction, my son always had to hold the bump on the cap with his mouth to drink water, and he thought that this part could be improved.
It seems that other brands' straw cups are right to make the straws at an angle, as safety and comfort are really important for children's things.
Lightweight and large capacity
I like that it's lightweight, has a large opening, and that it has two independent compartments, but for me, they're a bit excessive and I don't know what to put in them.
After buying it, I found that there was another brand that was very similar on Meiyihao.com, and it cost less than 200 yuan.
Fake goods are especially bad fakes.
Amazon sells fake goods, and I'm no exception.
The customer service said that because I used it, I cannot return it. How do I know it's a fake if I didn't use it?
Because of the trust, it is sad, after all, it is a makeup product. Go ahead and buy it from a physical store, it will be more expensive, but it will be genuine.
Because it was a flash sale, I didn't read the comments. I have already submitted a complaint to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Let's work together to protect our rights.
Broken?
Fake goods?
A tragedy overall.
When using the second piece, I chose the one with finer pores, but when I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I hadn't used this brand before, and then when I put it on my face, I couldn't stand the smell at all. It was very pungent and I couldn't describe it, and it made me cough immediately. My eyes also hurt, and I started tearing up. I immediately took it off and washed my face.
I don't believe in witchcraft, but I bought another one of the same type, which doesn't have such a strong taste, and I'm currently applying it.
It reminds me a bit of the smell of cheap hair straightening water in a hair salon.
It is hard to imagine that Amazon's own skincare products would also have to be avoided from now on?
What a scoundrel!
When I purchased it, the promotional page said that if you spent over 99 yuan, you would receive a "Three-Body Collection" as a gift, but when I received the goods, there was no such gift. I called customer service and asked them to take a look at the promotional page screenshot at the time, but the problem is, who buys things and keeps the web page screenshot? You need to provide your own evidence for your own activities, customers. Buyers, be careful next time and keep evidence.
After-feeling
There are a few things to note when buying something for the first time on Amazon. Let's talk about the experience of using the product first. The first thing is that it is painless and there is no irritating smell. Overall, it's pretty good. It takes about 8 minutes for it to fall off, but there will be a small amount of hair residue on top. If you don't look closely, you won't be able to tell. So overall, it's pretty good. As for the future, we'll have to keep using it to see how it goes.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
Second, I placed the order on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th, a total of 15 days, which is half a month. Amazon's delivery service attitude is also very good.
Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday deals. I ordered on Friday and waited two days, and it was almost 12 euros cheaper. I ended up paying around 170 euros (plus shipping and other fees), which gave me the feeling that they raise prices when they have promotions.
The customer service said that the price fluctuates, but I have been monitoring the price for more than 10 days, and it has been basically the same, with not much fluctuation.
Affordable prices, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, with particles, and definitely worth repurchasing!
The cream with particles in it is just the right amount of refreshing, and after using it, your teeth feel smooth. It's much better than some second-hand stuff from Dongxiang, and there are so many imported goods there that don't have Chinese labels. I don't know where they get them from.
From now on, I will never go to a second-hand shop again as long as Amazon has it.
Here's a suggestion: Sometimes the Amazon app doesn't let you share your receipts. I hope you can improve the app and make it better and better!
Over the years, Excellent has become increasingly worse, and there is no service quality to speak of at all!
Garbage is superior and doesn't care about customer needs. When placing an order, special delivery times are 19:00-22:00.
Since there is an elderly person who is bedridden after surgery at home, it is only convenient to receive packages at night.
The result was delivered directly to my door at noon, without any prior phone call.
If the delivery time is up to the discretion of your courier, why bother to make up a time for customers to choose from?
If your logistics cannot guarantee service, then you should not do e-commerce at all!
Making an elderly person with three wounds on his body get up from bed to open the door and pay for the delivery with loose change is ridiculous!
There is a contact phone number on the order!
No one has called to give an explanation from beginning to end, either by phone or in person!
The so-called complaint customer service of Zhuo Yue Network is a bunch of outsiders who pretend to be nice to you there, then brush off your complaints and give you a so-called reply.
There will be no changes or compensation!
Previously, we also encountered similar problems such as delivery times not being right, but we tolerated them. This time, however, we can't tolerate it anymore. It's too extreme!
The new book that I pre-ordered arrived with the front and back covers reversed, which is obviously a quality issue. Did they really send the book to the customer with their eyes closed?
No one will contact you about negative comments left on your post.
Over the years, Excellent has become increasingly worse, and there is no service quality to speak of at all!
We won't spend a penny more on excellence.
The image quality is simply unacceptable.
As a title, this book is simply unacceptable in terms of its choice of images, layout, and printing. Some of the images are even pixelated, making them impossible to recognize.
Even if this book is not a professional map book, and even if the illustrations are small, they should still do justice to the vast amount of medieval literary sources left by our ancestors listed in the index!
(And many of the images are available in clear original files from related industry resources)—what difference does it make to use such images to assemble a book without them?
I feel sorry for such a scholarly spirit.
As for the text, it is up to each member of the Fang family to decide.
Overall, 2 stars.
When I read this book in my second year of high school, I only did so out of boredom, thinking that I wouldn't get addicted to such a book, since I hadn't been attracted to the web novels on Qidian in the past.
Then... he fell into the pit.
According to the plot, the whole book is quite light and enjoyable, and the first part, when Yixiu was still in the online game, is no exception. Even the rivalry between guilds, which is usually quite heavy, is lightened by the fact that Yixiu often spoils the fun with his dog-eat-dog attitude.
As for the competition part, I wrote about the bittersweet feeling of the changing of the times, the old giving way to the new (maybe I'm just too sensitive).
I spent a lot of time studying the whole book during my second year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The full-time description of characters and emotional lines is very impressive, and some characters are only briefly mentioned but still leave a deep impression on people. For example, the characters Yi Zhuo, Huang Shao Tian, and Su Mi Tang, which are described in more detail, have a large number of fans, and even characters that are not the focus of the story, such as Jiang Bo Tong and Chu Yun Xiu, are also very popular. In a light novel about e-sports, it is surprising that there is not a single character that is hated to the extreme, which shows that All-Rounder has succeeded in character description.
In terms of the romance line, Full-time doesn't have the usual flaws of web novels, such as a harem of three thousand beauties, either beautiful or corrupt, and there are no problems with the characters' emotions. All the characters in the novel share a common trait, which is that they like the Glory game and want to win honorably.
The small quantities are not a big conspiracy, and everyone looks so innocent and adorable.
This may also be why there are no unpleasant roles in full-time jobs.
The full-time IP is quite large, and this is also due to this.
Setting aside the cultural phenomenon of web novels, it is still a good book in its own right.
To some extent, he does provide some passion and emotion.
The full-time version will be animated this April.
I've wanted to buy this set of books for a long time, but I've never had enough money in my pocket, so I never got around to buying it. Then when I wanted to buy it, I found out that TB was full of counterfeits. In fact, there's a new version of the book out recently, and I quite like the cover, but I'm still going to buy the old version, so I looked on Amazon and bought a set all at once.
Next, I will briefly talk about the goods.
The fourth book has no shrink wrap, but the book is new.
● The seventeenth book is sealed but has been opened, and the book feels very strange, as if it has no other hard pages.
The 23rd and 17th volumes are similar to the 17th volume, but they are also harder, but very old.
● The publishers of a few books are different, like 23 and 17 seem to be the same publisher, and others are different.
Overall, I am reasonably satisfied. The box of 24 books is quite large, and I am very satisfied.
The sad little lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as The Lost Corner, but there are still a lot of words!
I read it three times before finally finishing it for the little kids. It was about a lion that could shoot guns, and a lion that loved juice and lollipops.
When I saw the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern urbanites find it hard to accept the idea of animals eating people like that.
At the end, this little lion that has succeeded in human society has lost itself. It is no longer completely a lion, nor is it completely human.
Finally, there was only the lion cub's silhouette, and we didn't know where he had gone.
Years later, the image of the little lion may still linger in the minds of grown-up children, and it may be recalled unintentionally one day, perhaps touching or inspiring them.
Portfolio with a very high cost-performance ratio
I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but I recently bought a lot of their books because they are so powerful, both in terms of their subject matter and their production.
This work has been published in three versions, the largest of which is similar in size to the complete works of Michelangelo, measuring nearly 50 cm in length and 34 cm in width; the middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest and comes with two book volumes in a box.
Personally, I think it is acceptable. First, the price is cheap, and the 700-plus pages are divided into two volumes, which makes it easier to read as a paperback; second, it is different from the complete works of Michelangelo, in which the artworks take up the main body, and this version features Leonardo's black-and-white sketches, which take up most of the book, making it the best value for money for readers with limited budgets and who are not art specialists.
2. The commentary on the painting section is great, with analysis of composition, sketches, and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I don't know if it's a printing or book size issue, but some of the shadows are too dark, making it difficult to see the details, which is a bit disappointing.
3, Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Da Vinci's manuscripts contain much more content.
The former is already a genius, and the latter is so broad in scope and so high in achievement that it cannot be described as genius.
If you only looked at the paintings, you could only understand half of da Vinci. After seeing the sketches, you are completely speechless.
Trash, whoever buys it will regret it!
I never give bad reviews, this is a real piece of garbage, I wasted my money on it. Give me a reason!
The time is not correct. Suddenly, it becomes January 1, and the time resets to zero.
2. The low-quality belt is not made of silicone, and it caused an allergic reaction and swelling on my wrist.
3. I often can't connect to my phone.
The battery life is only five days.
5. The sleep test does not show a time of 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Others.
Logistics are too slow
It was displayed that the result was received on October 21, but it was only received on October 16, and it was a bad review!
The delivery is so bad, it's slow to buy things on Amazon anyway, and I didn't expect it to be this slow!
Overall, satisfied
Previously, I was worried about the camera packaging, but this time it was fine. There was an inflatable bag inside, and the camera was in perfect condition. I was also able to register it on the official website, and the shutter count was zero. The rest can only be verified by time.
The delivery speed is quite fast, so I'm going to complain a bit about the delivery guy here. He just left the valuable items in the hallway and ran off so fast that I couldn't check them in front of him. I'm speechless about this.
The merchants thought of their customers before shipping:)
The merchants are quite responsible and called specifically to ask about the screen size of the camera used. They really thought of their customers.
Shipping speed is also fast.
The Kevlar film is quite suitable and useful when applied.
The battery is not fully charged
The machine is indeed good, but I wonder why it can't be fully charged the first time it's charged. The charging indicator light is always red.
There is no official Amazon feedback channel at the moment, so the only way to provide feedback is through product reviews.
On March 29, I purchased this book for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel, and it was supposed to be delivered to my device on March 31. At that time, it was not possible to preview the book on the Amazon website (because it had not yet been released).
2. On March 31, the book was pushed to the device, and the content was blank, with the only message being "Please look forward to it." The electronic version of the book on Amazon was discounted to 18 yuan.
3. Over the past two days, I have repeatedly tried to delete the blank downloads on the device and resync, but have been unable to obtain an electronic version of The Essence of Commerce that contains actual content, although I have seen that it is now possible to preview the book on the Amazon website.
At the moment, I have a few thoughts:
The price issue is not the most important one. The key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books that have actual content now, rather than always downloading "coming soon" books.
2. After pre-ordering a book, you should probably not buy it again, because if it is canceled, you will have to download another book with empty content, and the process looks very complicated.
3. Amazon should provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues. When there are doubts about e-book downloads or use, there should be a place to report them (customer service tickets or online customer service are fine, and can be modeled after Microsoft's official store).
Not recommended for reading
I read it a long time ago, and just happened to see someone write a review based on memory.
This book is more like a collection of fragments of life about love than a collection of short stories.
The tone of this book is extremely bland, like plain water, and the language and sentence structure are extremely concise, reflecting a pursuit of minimalism to the extreme. The plot is also like a quiet street on a summer afternoon, with nothing out of the ordinary.
Each short story is a snapshot of a moment in ordinary life, without a beginning or an end.
Finally collected together, it was titled "When We Talk About Love, We Are Talking About What?"
I think this short story collection, and its title, are like a performance art, in which the author wants to express that love is not just the ups and downs of life on the stage, nor is it the ebb and flow of urban legends, nor is it the sticky sweetness of you and me, nor should it be represented by either of those things. Love is more than that; it is also the dullness of everyday life, the monotony of day after day, the helplessness in the face of life, and the escape from reality into the future.
While reading this book, you may recall the quarreling couples around you, the dull marriages of people you know, and the unfortunate love affairs.
This is why I do not recommend reading it from an aesthetic perspective. The writing and plot of the book are bland and uninspiring, unless your life is a roller coaster ride or as sweet as living in a candy castle. Otherwise, you will feel bored and indifferent while reading it.
From a philosophical perspective, the daily events did not provide any eye-opening insights or expand one's horizons (unlike Marx's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the brief segments did not explore any issues, such as what kind of error led to the failure of love?
What were the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I do not recommend reading this book. It doesn't really matter whether you read it or not.
The author's ideas are more often expressed through techniques and forms rather than the story plot, which is one of the reasons why the reading experience of this book is not very good.
It is suitable for a quick read, but not for a detailed read.
The book is logically sound, but the content is not rich enough.
It explained a lot about sales theory, what it is and why, but it was very weak in terms of how to do it, only pointing out the direction without providing specific methods.
In addition, the book feels like it was cobbled together.
Examples include both domestic and foreign, both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and obscure individuals;
I don't know if the stories were compiled for illustrative purposes or not, but if some real-life examples from the authors' own experiences were included, they would be more convincing.
The terms "customer" and "client" are used interchangeably.
In the title, the customer is still the customer, but in the body, they become the client.
The e-book also contains problems such as typos, missing punctuation marks, and numbering errors.
In general, this book is a good choice as an introduction to theory, but it is not suitable for salespeople who are already in the field and want to improve their sales skills.
A Quick Guide to Understanding Internet Finance
This book is very superficial and can be said to be an introductory course. It can help people quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but if you want to delve deeper, you still need to go the extra mile and do your own research.
The book was published quite some time ago, and it did not mention the later payment rivalry between Alipay and WeChat, which cultivated user habits through subsidies, nor did it mention the current third-party payment market share, which is probably no longer as small as the book says.
Nowadays, many people go out to eat and only need to bring a mobile phone. Merchants have also abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank transaction fees.
However, I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book, as it is clear that he has at least several years of financial observation experience, and is very familiar with the history of financial development both domestically and internationally, which is why he was able to write such easy-to-understand content.
It is easy to write in a high-flown style, but difficult to write in a simple and easy-to-understand way.
I appreciate you, but I want you to know it!
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not their salary, but whether they are given enough attention and recognition in their work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, after the basic survival needs of a person are met, the most pressing need is the fulfillment of psychological needs—the desire to be understood, appreciated, and recognized.
Indeed, for the Chinese, most of the time it is "love is hard to express," even if there is love, gratitude, and appreciation in their hearts, they will not say it out loud.
The author explains five languages of praise in this book: affirmative language, thoughtful moments, acts of service, heartfelt gifts, and physical contact.
I think it's not important to know exactly what the five languages of appreciation are, but rather to be able to genuinely express appreciation and gratitude to the people around you, whether they are family members, friends, or colleagues, at any time and in any place.
In fact, the more intimate the relationship, the more we need to praise and be grateful, so that our lives will become more beautiful.
Companies can retain talent to a certain extent by learning to appreciate their employees.
Thank you translator for bringing us the fascinating foreign thoughts and the world.
Due to the differences in cultural backgrounds between the East and the West, as well as other factors, there will inevitably be some differences between languages. If there is an opportunity to see the original version, I believe it will be more rewarding.
Thank you again to the author and translator, and to the editors for their hard work!
Suspected counterfeit goods, please Amazon to strictly inspect
The quality is super bad, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, and it is even worse than the products sold on the street stalls. There is no weight, there is no barcode, and the packaging of 10 rolls is also loose. It is not a quality product at all; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon. I have applied for a refund. It is a quality issue. I recommend that merchants be vigilant and refuse to sell substandard goods. I have also bought another roll of Kodak, which costs 23 yuan in the supermarket for 10 rolls. I have added a few comparison photos to further verify the inferiority of the product. This is done to provide consumers with a clearer reference to avoid economic losses and further bad feelings!
We once again hope that Amazon can be meticulous in ensuring the authenticity of its products.
The products are of poor quality and do not meet expectations
Advantages:
1. Big brands, cheap prices.
Advantage 2: The motor and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are OK to use, but they fall short of my expectations.
Disadvantages:
1. There is no indicator light for charging, which means that the most basic power indicator is omitted, and the customer who purchased a product for 300 yuan is considered to be a charity case and not worthy of respect in Panasonic's eyes.
2. There is a strong odor. Even when charging for just 10 minutes, you can smell the strong odor of plastic burning.
After one day of use, the entire house smelled of plastic. The office was to blame.
Compared with the Philips PHILIPS of the same price range that I used before, although this Panasonic product has an additional blade, its quality is really not up to the mark for consumers.
Small packages
When I received the package, I saw that it said "e-commerce version" on the top, so I knew I had fallen into the trap again. It was much smaller than the one I bought at the supermarket, and it should be an M size. The packaging was different from the one shown in the product description, so it must be the new version.
Three stars are for blaming myself for not paying attention to the product specifications and for you selling me an M-size e-commerce version when I asked for an L-size. What does "your goods are not the right size" mean?
E-commerce is a tricky business, so sometimes I still go to the supermarket to buy.
As for the purple sauce.
I don't like the taste
Children do not like the taste of toothpaste very much, and they always say it is spicy. Perhaps a different word would be more appropriate to describe it, but for now, this is the only word in the child's vocabulary.
I bought it when I was organizing an event, and it was very cheap, so I don't feel bad giving it a low rating. Four stars, but I won't buy it again.
It's the real thing, nicely packaged
The packaging is very complete, and there is an inflatable bag inside. There is only the product itself, which looks completely bare, without any comments online.
There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle, just as described in the picture, and the delivery is also very fast. It arrived the next day after I took the photo.
It is the genuine article, but it is out of stock and we don't know when it will be restocked.
A disappointing shopping experience
I placed an order during Black Friday, but it took a long time to receive it. After checking, I found that the package had already been signed for, and when I asked my colleagues around me, they all said that they hadn't helped sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said that only the sender could initiate a search, so I contacted Amazon customer service, and after waiting for more than ten days, I finally figured out that the parcel had been mistakenly delivered to someone else, and it took several rounds before I finally got it back. The outer packaging had already been opened, but the goods were still intact, and I don't know if they had been used, which was quite frustrating.
Incorrect illustrations
I thought I would receive headphones like the ones in Figure 1, but instead I received headphones like those in Figure 2. The discrepancy between the picture and the actual product is one thing, but what does it mean that the left and right channels have different volumes?
Although the names are the same, we still hope that everyone will be careful and pay attention. We also ask the Amazon manager to update the correct images as soon as possible. Thank you very much.
The operating system is average
After using it for a while, the overall picture quality is still acceptable, and I don't feel much of a difference. The only thing is that the system is a bit confusing to use, the boot time is noticeably slower than expected, and it's difficult to make good settings. The software that came with it is also not worth mentioning, and the response speed is just average compared to my colleague's. It's not even in the same league.
The comments say that the design is very humanized, but I couldn't find where it was humanized. The position of the common up, down, left, right, and return keys on the remote control is really hard to praise.
So, in other words, just watch TV and add a TV box or something like that.
The price cut is too drastic.
The price reduction is too drastic! It's now 99 instead of over 100!
There were many unrated orders on Amazon, so I used a copy-pasted sentence as the review content for all of them.
If I use this sentence to evaluate it, it means that the product is at least 85 points or above.
For products of poorer quality, I would never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews, as other consumers would use them as a reference when buying, and the merchants would also improve the quality of their products as a result.
Low price, good quality, that's all you need!
These cables are so cheap, but they should meet the HDMI certification standards. I personally compared them with the stuff sold in Akihabara in China, which is twice as expensive, and found that they are thicker and more flexible, with no noise during 7-meter transmission. In the future, I will buy low-priced cables from Belkin!
The goods are fine, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites
After placing the order, I realized I had made a mistake, but it was too late to cancel the order. The link to the online customer service on the website kept showing an error message and I was unable to contact them.
After delivery, the delivery person called me and I said I didn't want it. I didn't manage to cancel the order successfully, so the delivery person took it back and told me to sign for it and apply for a refund.
When requesting a return, it was only then that I was informed that food items cannot be returned once they have been received, and there is no way to contact Amazon customer service by phone, which says the same thing: once received, items cannot be returned.
I have bought items that cannot be returned for policy reasons from both JD.com and Suning in the past, including milk, diapers, and so on. I contacted customer service and they all gave me a refund, and JD.com even gave me a refund for the diapers after I opened them, even though the smell was too strong. You can't do that on Amazon.
Rules are dead, people are alive. How do you handle it by contacting your customer service?
They told me either to take it myself or let the delivery person buy it, but the delivery person is already having a hard time, so why should I make them pay for something they didn't buy?
Okay, I won't back down either. I took it myself, but I have to give you a 1 for your service.
I advise everyone not to waste money
First, I was full of expectations when I bought it, thinking that the Dole brand should be pretty good, but when I received it, I felt that the packaging was still acceptable. The size was not bad either. However, when I opened the box, I found that most of the contents were soft and squishy, and there was no way to tell from the outside. You have to feel it in your hand, and when you put it in your mouth, there is no taste at all, it's bland and tasteless. If you bite into it, the fruit flesh goes all the way around in a dark yellow color, which means it's spoiled. They sell good and bad ones, and you can only eat about one-third of what you buy. I advise everyone not to buy it, because it's not cheap and the quality is terrible!
Eat a watermelon and gain a bit of wisdom. I will never buy fruit online again!
Where are the anti-counterfeiting marks on the product?
The bottom corner of the bottle is severely indented, which must have been caused by a strong impact. From the outer packaging bag, it looks like the damage is heartbreaking, as the packaging for foodstuffs is too simple, and it's also an international product, and there's no obvious anti-counterfeiting marking on it. Opening the bottle is very easy, and the most important thing is that the layer of honey inside the cap has come out directly from the inside, almost without any stickiness. Are all foreign products like this?
I, who was born in China, am a little confused now.
It should be the genuine article, right?
There are also reminders that the package will arrive on the 20s, and this one was received on the 14th. I'm making my first overseas purchase here, so I just wrote down my doubts, maybe this is all normal?
Pickup service needs improvement
I bought a total of five pickup tickets. When I went to pick them up, I scheduled the pickup for the first time for three tickets, but only two were delivered. After multiple communications, it was confirmed that they were misdelivered, and I was promised that they would be reissued. When I scheduled the pickup for the second time, it happened to be a holiday, and the website and WeChat both failed to indicate that the pickup had to be scheduled on a working day, which caused unnecessary panic. I suggest that this should be improved in the future.
Good shopping
Great reviews!
I still trust Amazon's own products more. After the launch of Tmall Global, it is now very convenient to order from abroad. The logistics time from abroad is only a few days longer than from within the country, so I have to say that Amazon's Tmall Global's customs clearance capability is quite strong, and it is much faster than using a transshipment service, so now many things are bought from Tmall Global.
I hope that the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, and that many things are produced domestically. However, it is cheaper to buy them after going out and coming back, and I hope this can be improved.
Garbage
When you see such a package, ask yourself: Does it look like roadside garbage?
A fragile plastic packaging was sent in a plastic bag from so-called Germany. Is this packaging responsible?
I think this kind of packaging is just like garbage. Buying this product, the packaging is very crude and there are no measures to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag. After receiving it, the package was completely deformed and the items inside were also damaged.
If I only encountered one such item, I would have accepted it. I bought a few of them, and they were all like that. I contacted Amazon customer service, and the customer service representative said that I could return it, but that I would have to pay for the shipping, which would then be refunded to me in the form of a gift card.
I ask, why did you give me a gift card when I paid for the shipping with cash? Why didn't you just tell me to buy your gift card directly? And why did you make me ship the product to the German warehouse myself? That's not how you buy a product!
I have always told the customer service that it is their responsibility to deal with such problems, but they have never said that it is their responsibility, and they are not even willing to take responsibility for half of it. What kind of after-sales service is this? How can there be any guarantee? In one word, they are shirking their responsibilities! I estimate that Amazon will not give me the opportunity to publish this evaluation, and will simply delete it.
Quality is good, 5 stars, but logistics are bad
1, The quality is very good, it's a steal, the price is reasonable, and it's worth the money.
2, it is solid, the materials are sufficient, the welding is firm, the surface treatment is appropriate, and the color is very good.
3, logistics is a hard blow. The order placed on the 3rd was delivered on the 11th.
4, If Amazon had not indicated that the estimated delivery date was February 7, I might have been quite satisfied.
5, but marking the expected delivery time is equivalent to making a promise to the user, which is difficult for the user to accept when the promise cannot be fulfilled.
6. If you are not confident in your ability to fulfill the promise, do not make the promise.
7. In fact, I am very concerned about the commitments made by merchants.
8, so I scored low.
The gold line will fade
The effect is there, but whether it is noticeable or not depends on the individual, or it may be a psychological effect.
There is one thing that is not so good, and that is the gold thread. It was originally designed to look nice, but in reality, the gold thread fades and if you put it on the car, if you move it around a few times, there will be some gold dust on your hands and on the car.
I hope the product can be improved.
This square shape doesn't have much decorative effect, so there's no need to put gold trim on it. If it falls off, it will get dirty on the car and cause trouble.
The goods are intact, the speed is good, and they are packaged in two separate packages
The speed of delivery in eight days is quite fast, but they split the two items into two parcels, and the packaging was different for each. It was obvious that one parcel had too much shock absorption, with thick cardboard attached and a layer of plastic wrapped around it. The outer packaging was also easy to open, and one parcel looked like a domestic courier box, with a few shock absorbers thrown in as an afterthought. It felt a bit sloppy.
Yaran mattresses are really good
A 34 cm thick mattress is not particularly thick, so you can sleep directly on the mattress without a bed.
The quality is very good, both the front and the back are quite soft, and sleeping on it is very comfortable. You fall asleep quickly when lying on it.
After receiving the mattress, there were two small stains on it due to the violent transportation by the courier. Yalan customer service was very responsible and very efficient in contacting me to solve the problem.
Amazon is shameless for not selling its own goods
The page clearly indicates that it is self-operated, but in fact the goods are delivered by the supplier, and after-sales service is handled by the supplier. If there is a problem, you can contact the supplier directly.
You want to cancel the order? Sorry, the order information has been sent to the supplier and cannot be canceled; you want to exchange or return the item? Sorry, no one cares about you, you need to contact the supplier yourself to return the item after successfully applying for a return on Amazon.
This is some kind of self-operated product.
The goods are not delivered by Amazon, and after-sales service is not provided by Amazon. The customer service even said, "I will contact the supplier for you," and claimed that it was self-operated. This is too shameless, and it is a blatant fraud against consumers!
Frustrating experience
The filter cartridge I bought from another online store previously had a good filtration effect. After 28 days, I continued to use it for another couple of days, and it still did not have any scale buildup.
Since the quality of the things I have purchased from Amazon has always been good, I thought I would buy them here this time. This was the first time I bought a filter cartridge from Amazon, and I felt it was not very good. Not only did it start to have water scale early on, but the filter cartridge also lasted for 28 days, and there was always floating black carbon powder in it. I was very frustrated and didn't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away.
It's not as good as imagined
Compared with the power strips I have used in the past, the workmanship on the outside is average, and I can't tell how it is inside without disassembling it, but I hope it is as described by the seller, in terms of convenience of use, whether each independent unit is powered on or not is not clearly indicated
The packaging is damaged, so wait for the time to check the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is severely damaged, but the inner packaging box seems to be new. The instruction manual, however, seems not to be new. The house was only renovated in September, and we are still in the process of stocking up. I hope it won't turn out to be bad when the time comes. Amazon, please explain why several customers have mentioned the damaged packaging, but you have been able to deal with it calmly. Thank you!
Overall, it's pretty good, but there are a few minor issues.
The first time I bought a water filter bottle, I read a few reviews and felt that LAICA's value for money was better, so I chose this one. I followed the instructions to install the filter cartridge when I received the product, and tried it out a bit. Overall, I think it's not bad, but when pouring water, it seems that the original water mixes with the filtered water at the mouth of the bottle (the seal of the original water tank is not very tight).
When using it, you must wait until all the water has been filtered before pouring it out!
The image is incomplete
The photo did not capture the details of the side, and the details of the side are not consistent with the main body style, which is a big difference; this bead is made in Thailand, but there is no indication of the country of origin, which is the second point; there is no indication of the quality, which is the third point; when I bought it in the UK, each item came in its own box, but here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there are no product signs on the bead, so I cannot tell whether it is real or fake.
Buy with caution, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service is really bad.
Two days ago, I placed an order that was delivered today, and I found that it was 40 yuan cheaper than the original price. It took a long time to find the customer service, and the customer service said that they could not make up the difference, but I could reorder and return the item.
This customer experience and service is a thousand times better than that of Taobao or Tmall.
Not bad, it's worth a try for beginners
The appearance is acceptable, and it's not as good as the ultimate diamond. I saw the price at the mall before, and it was at least several hundred. I'm playing with gold for the first time, so it's okay.
It's not bad
The food was really good, and it was a gift for my girlfriend. However, I had an unpleasant experience in the afternoon when I wasn't there to receive the delivery from Canada Post. The logistics company simply put the mail in the Mailbox and didn't send me a confirmation text message, which made me run back and forth twice.
However, the baby is indeed quite good.
Worth buying
The little monkeys are cute, and Amazon's discounts are really big. Zhou Sheng Sheng's official website delivers directly, and I ordered last night and received it this afternoon. It's really fast.
Postal and courier workers are also very responsible.
Bravo!
A customer's confession
1 If you receive such a defective product, Amazon customer service will tell you not to worry, we will contact you within 54 hours or so.
2 Then, in the middle, you contact customer service personnel, who will tell you that this issue will be handled by a specialist, who will inform you of the result.
You will never be able to reach this officer proactively, and you don't know her work number, nor do you have her direct line number. If you can't reach her, it's only because she can't reach you.
The tragedy is that I waited nearly three days for the specialist to contact me, and when my phone was out of reach for a moment, I didn't receive the specialist's call.
I waited for two hours but never got the call from the specialist. In the meantime, I proactively contacted Amazon customer service and emailed them to ask them to call me back.
It has been almost 4 days since I received this defective coffee machine from Amazon, and I still don't know what the outcome will be!
There are no problems with the products sold by Amazon USA, but the shopping method of buying from overseas is good, but the service provided by Amazon.com is far inferior.
6 is something I can only keep waiting for... for me.
The ground is not level
Because the review said it was very good, everyone was looking forward to this pot, and when they got it in their hands, they liked it very much. It was very lightweight, but when they opened it, they found a problem. The bottom of the pot was not flat; it was raised in the middle and indented around the edges. The oil ran to the edges, and the specially bought thick cuts of meat fried out a lot of oil that couldn't cover the central area. It was a failure. They couldn't even open the pot, and this kind of structure probably can't cook food normally.
I don't know if I was just unlucky, but I just happened to get a pan with a warped bottom. Fortunately, Amazon offers a one-month return service, so I returned it without hesitation.
I spent half a day scrubbing the pan clean, only to end up with nothing to show for it.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve it
This product has a very simple design style.
The cube-shaped design features a slight arc at the top, which the designer has slightly curved.
It should have been a very smooth line.
Unfortunately, the final result was not achieved.
There are two components on the top, a control panel in front and a water tank lid in the back.
The arc of the lid and the arc of the control panel are inconsistent, and when they are joined together, a height difference of up to 2 mm or so appears.
Although it looks like a very small gap, it is.
However, it can be said that it completely destroyed the entire design aesthetic.
I feel a bit sorry for that product designer.
It seems that Midea's product manager does not have the ability to create products of this caliber.
(Of course, we cannot expect too much from the after-sales lady, but when I heard the after-sales say that all the units of this product were like this, not just the one I bought that had a problem, I understood that we cannot expect too much from beauty either, and the lady's indifference and sincere sense of responsibility made me realize this.) On July 7, 2019, the pump malfunctioned and the water flow was insufficient. This was the second time it had been repaired, and two weeks after the first repair, it was broken again.
After the discount, it's very cost-effective. Amazon's fake discounts are very disappointing
The baby blanket was purchased one week after the baby was born, and it is very warm.
The outside of the kettle feels no heat at all, so it is not only safe to touch, but also effectively prevents heat from dissipating.
After a night in an air-conditioned room, the temperature remains very high.
Amazon said that the anniversary event offered a 320% discount, but later it was discovered that everyone had it, including 249,289,299 people. Suddenly, I felt like I had been cheated, but after going to the supermarket and comparing prices, I found that it was still more cost-effective than various brands at the same price range. In the future, I will carry it with me when I go out.
Vitamix 6300 VitaMix
I have been watching for a long time, and now I see that Meiyazhi 6300 is on sale, and it is the same price at China-Asia Overseas Shopping. I hurried to buy it.
I placed the order on September 2, and it was expected to arrive on the 21st. However, it arrived on the 12th, which was about 10 days earlier than expected. It was really fast!
The packaging box is not very big, and it uses the original packaging from Vitamix directly. Amazon doesn't mind if it gets tossed across the ocean and broken!
The machine looks pretty new, and all the parts are complete. The only problem is that the cups shake violently when placed on the base, and I'm afraid that if I turn it on, the cups will fly out directly!
I asked a friend who had 5200 to describe it, and it sounded like it wasn't as loose as mine.
The recipes included randomly are all in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I couldn't find a Chinese version online either, which is a real pain!
After receiving the goods, I hurried to buy a transformer. It should arrive in about three days, so I'll take my time to fiddle with it then!
It is too small, there is no cover, and the material is average.
It's not a big size at all!
The second umbrella is a Totes. 1. This one doesn't have a cover 2. The umbrella handle is average quality 3. Although it says Large, it's actually a convenient umbrella for one person, and two people would probably find it too small.
On the contrary, the one I bought at Meijia before can be used by three people without any pressure.
I don't feel too good
First, the box is not very sturdy, and it warps when you press on it. Second, the design on the back to prevent ABS scratches on the box surface when placed flat is ineffective, and third, the box contains a piece of cloth with a handle that sticks out... and so on. There are many things that are not satisfactory. Finally, the zipper is a bit stiff.
PS: The wheels really do feel pretty good
You can also
Advantages: This shoulder bag is quite elegant and looks durable.
Drawbacks: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what the hell?), the 15.6-inch laptop won't fit in the bag (it's just a little too long), and this shoulder bag's zipper can be locked, but it doesn't come with a key for the buyer, which is not exactly service-oriented.
Overall, it's okay, I don't know if it's real leather or not
Overall, it feels okay. I don't know if it's real leather or not, so I can't really comment on it.
It can hold A4-sized documents, but it can only hold documents that are up to 80 pages thick. It is unlikely that it can hold objects that are too thick and hard to bend.
The bag is very soft, and the inner pockets are also quite user-friendly. It's quite good overall.
However, the bottom of the one I got has a small sand hole, I wonder if it's because of my bad character?
I was too lazy to go back and forth to exchange the goods, so I put up with it.
Overall, it's worth four stars.
ForRoyal is popular all over the world for its camera straps and DSLR straps
The strap design is quite scientific, hanging from the shoulders, practical, and the camera is secured and protected in the front by soft materials, unlike other Canon cameras that use screws to secure the bottom and damage the camera when removed.
Garbage after-sales
I bought a piano a month and a half ago, and it's missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me a customer service phone number, and after multiple communications, I still haven't received the part. What kind of efficiency is this?
Afterwards, repairs are more troublesome, so friends who expect good after-sales service might as well go around. It's too much trouble!
There are some minor flaws, but the sound quality is good
The violin has a defect; it is missing a corner. It feels like a defective product, and there are no gifts, but the price is not bad at all, and the sound of the violin is also good.
It's okay, the first bowl of noodles
I've used it for a long time, and although the bass doesn't come out, overall it's not bad.
The workmanship is not as perfect as imagined.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem with the product. All the lights were flashing and it was unusable.
I requested a replacement, but the goods have been in Shanghai for three days now and still haven't been delivered.
They don't even pick up the phone when you call to arrange delivery.
The courier company said that was the only contact information they had.
Amazon couldn't find a place to complain.
I didn't ask for it, but I received a text saying that my delivery was delayed for no reason, and that it would be delayed according to my request - in this case.
Then they said something about transit issues.
At least the shopping experience was terrible, making me doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
It is estimated that we won't be able to get it today either.
The adhesive is not strong enough, and it is not waterproof
Although Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof and the surface is not laminated; and the adhesive is very poor, making it unsuitable for use as a cable label. Friends who bought it to organize cables should pay attention to this. It is very easy for the label to fall off.
The pen is fine, but the packaging is too crude. It's just a plain cardboard box, with no protection whatsoever, and the box containing the pen is stuck together with a big piece of transparent glue, which leaves glue residue on the box when you peel it off.
I was very disappointed with this purchase, as the item costing RMB600 was treated in such a way.
The pen is fine.
Hopefully, there will be more improvements to the packaging in the future!
The quality is excellent, but if we talk about writing, 925-25 is better.
Let me praise TNT Express first. Air delivery is super fast, and the service attitude is also very good!
I have been using the 925-25 for a long time, and it is very good. I just received the 925-85, and the quality of the pen is excellent, and the design is also very beautiful. The reason I gave it four stars is that the pen is a bit heavy and not suitable for fast writing. The lead adjustment at the cap of the pen is a bit wobbly, in my opinion, the 925-25 is easier to use than the 925-85.
Thus, I became a diehard Amazon fan.
We bought a talking pen at a super discounted price, but the child doesn't like it.
The package has been opened, so I tried to apply for a refund. To my surprise, they offered free home pickup.
That's awesome.
We do not encourage returns, but this service is unique in China.
It should not be abused.
After that, all the books were moved to this location.
Headphones have distortion and noise
This headset is pure garbage. I don't know if it's my ears or if the headset is really not as good as it used to be.
I bought a blue one from a certain easy-to-buy store two years ago, and the sound quality was not bad and there was no distortion or low-end problems. I used it for more than two years and it broke, so I plan to buy another one (UrBeats) because it feels good.
I looked at another one that was purple and looked quite nice, but when I opened it today, I felt that it was not right. The sound was either too loud or too soft.
At first, I thought it was just the sound effects of the song that were the problem, but after listening for half an hour, I realized that the problem was quite serious. Not only was the sound distorted, the bass effect was also not as good as before, and there was some background noise. Is it only my purple one that has this problem? Or is it that earphone manufacturing technology has really deteriorated nowadays?
A very poor rating, I am very disappointed.
You must return the goods tomorrow during the daytime.
PS looks good
This AV amplifier is complex in design, has rough workmanship, and generates a lot of heat.
It takes time to get used to the sound, so give it a while before judging it!
On August 14, I just bought the German version of DN1080. The first thing I noticed was the quality of the workmanship.
The front panel and knobs are all made of plastic.
2. The audio input and output terminals of the rear panel are good and bad, and you can easily find a 1000-2000 yuan all-in-one CD player that is much better than this one.
3. The lid is quite thin, and my transformer is even sunken down on one side. I had no choice but to open the box and restore it by hand, as the lid and front panel were loose.
4. The center of gravity of the entire machine is shifted towards the transformer end, making it very difficult to move.
It feels like an entry-level product from SONY, with that kind of workmanship, made in Malaysia.
I feel that Sony would be much better off outsourcing to China than to Shima.
5. The machine gets very hot. After watching a movie for about two hours, the top cover is about 40-50 ℃ when touched by hand. I don't know if it's because the transformer is too big and produces too much heat.
Nowadays, most people use switched power supplies, and this huge transformer probably weighs about 4 kg.
Sony should have used a silent active cooling fan inside the machine, but all I saw after opening it was a large aluminum heat dissipation plate on the pipes.

I haven't opened it yet
The battery is in use.
I really want to dissect it to see what's inside its belly.
Later, I thought about it and realized that if it turned out to be very disappointing after opening it, it would be too unfair to have spent so much money; if it turned out to be very satisfying after opening it, putting it back together would be difficult, and using it would be uncomfortable.
Never mind, even if Sony uses good battery cells.
As for the detailed description of the battery, most people will feel at a loss.
I'm fine, I used to work in a mobile phone factory for a long time, and I'm basically half an engineer of batteries, so I can handle it.
Delighted
I really had no idea what to expect before buying it, but when I opened it and saw the packaging, I felt it was really good!
Finally, when I touched the headphone cable, it felt very flexible, and the quality was too good. I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ Music.
I was shocked to find that the sound quality was 3D surround sound!
I asked in a physical communications store, and it was about 30 yuan or so, but definitely not the Pisen brand. It was a generic brand, so I can say that although the Pisen costs 27 yuan, it is definitely worth the price!
The worst online shopping experience
After placing the order on September 28, the system showed that the order had been shipped, but the goods never arrived until October 12.
Checking the status of Amazon orders, the seller did not provide the tracking number, so the order cannot be located.
So I sent an email to the seller asking whether they could provide the express delivery number. Two days later, there was still no reply.
Out of desperation, I called Amazon customer service, and the customer service representative told me the seller's phone number. I then called the store and after a few attempts, the phone was answered, and I was told that the package had been lost in transit, and they could immediately resend it to me.
Although I was very angry, I didn't say much to the seller because the computer was urgently needed, so I just asked them to send it to me immediately.
The result was that the next day I called to ask if the goods had been shipped?
The seller said it's not ready yet, it will be sent out this afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon and asked the seller if it would definitely be shipped. The seller said it would be shipped after 5-6 p.m. in the afternoon, but when I called at 7 p.m. that night, there was no answer.
On the third day in the morning, I called again and asked if the goods had been shipped out.
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said that it hadn't been sent yet, and told me that if I was in a hurry, I could order it from elsewhere, and if it was possible to wait, it would be sent in the afternoon.
There's no other way, I have to wait a long time to order from somewhere else.
All we can do is ask the seller to ship the goods as soon as possible.
After numerous phone calls, I finally received the computer on October 16.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because I bought it for someone else, so I'll add a comment later.
I bought it half a year ago but only used it a few times. Now it has a bad contact, can I get it repaired?
Because there was a desktop computer, I didn't use it much after I bought it.
I just bring it along a few times when I go on business trips.
Recently, it was discovered that when the power is turned on, but the charger is not plugged in, you need to shake the connection between the charger and the cable a few times with your hand to charge it.
I suspect that the interface is faulty, and I don't know if it can be repaired now.
Strongly recommend that Amazon stop using EMS!
Products get five stars, logistics one star, and an average of three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon has to use EMS. It's widely regarded as unreliable, well, at least a computer is a valuable item!
After the order was placed, the estimated delivery date was the 20th, so the family members stayed home for three days waiting for the delivery!
Why does it take four or five days to send something from Xiamen to Fuzhou?
On the morning of the 22nd, the goods finally arrived in Fuzhou, and we were ready to receive them happily. However, in the evening, without receiving any phone calls or text messages, we checked the logistics and found that the goods had already been signed for in the middle of the day, and it even showed that it was signed for by me!
I was instantly shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Is this computer really mine?
I almost doubt the meaning of life!
In the end, I had to make a trip to the collection point to pick up the computer before I could bring it back.
The specific reason is simply that the courier mixed up the two order numbers, and fortunately, the package was not lost.
I strongly recommend that Amazon stop using EMS. If Amazon uses EMS to send parcels in the future, I will definitely not buy from them anymore.
The goods are not bad
First, I want to say that I bought it a few days ago and found that it had been discounted. I gave it a bad review, but it's actually not bad. It has a good price-to-performance ratio, and the CPU and graphics card are sufficient to handle mainstream online games and most large-scale single-player games. The cooling system is very good, but the screen has some light leakage (a common problem with IPS screens), the sound quality is not very good, and the hard drive is not very good (I recommend upgrading to a solid-state drive). Yesterday, I took it to the after-sales department for inspection, and there were no problems with the hardware. The pre-installed Windows 8.1 is not very user-friendly, and I recommend upgrading to Windows 10. The seller shipped the goods very quickly, and he answered all my questions very quickly. I received the computer the day after I bought it, and the invoice arrived the next day. It's not bad, but there were no gifts.
(By the way, if you want to buy a keyboard film, don't go to a store called Ecool Digital Center on Taobao. Delivery is slow and the quality is poor. If there are any problems with the product, they won't exchange or refund it, and the owner uses a lot of foul language. I'd like to especially expose this.)
The food is good, but the bureaucracy is still there
The hard drive quality is very good, and the price-performance ratio is absolutely high. It is cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, and if you are not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate the shipping, I would definitely recommend buying it.
However, it must be said that the Amazon platform is still bureaucratic, and has not improved since I swore I would never use it a few years ago. You can never find out the actual logistics situation, and information is always delivered several weeks later, and there is no way to complain. It's just so bureaucratic!
The goods have been delivered for several days now, but the logistics information says that you will receive the goods in about 10 days!
Logistics are a headache
The package arrived in this condition, not only was it flattened, but the electrical appliance packaging was also open, and I don't know if it has been tampered with.
FYI
I haven't tried it yet, but I have always trusted Philips, and I hope the battery life is longer than other brands.
I checked online and it seems to be a common problem with water leaks, and there is no warranty.
Frustrating!
Now that it's wrapped in plastic wrap, how long will it last? I don't know.
I bought one that had already been opened by someone else
The tax on a machine worth more than 300 is indeed quite high, but now that it's over 600, it feels more balanced.
When I received it, the sealing tape looked very suspicious, as if it had been opened before, so I took a photo right away and then ripped it open. Sure enough, it opened easily, and the paperboard inside was also damaged. I was worried that it had been returned by someone else, so I hurried to try it out for my husband before the anniversary, but the machine had no power at all, and fortunately, there was no debris in the blade. Otherwise, it would have been a long way to return it!
Whether it is easy to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term is still unknown. As mentioned earlier, the things sent out when there is a shortage are indeed not reliable!
The experience level is slightly above average
It's pretty much the top-of-the-line electric toothbrush, with lots of different cleaning modes, but few people are going to change modes every day.
I used it for half a year without any problems. I brushed my teeth every day and flossed about once a week.
The brush head accessories are also cheap on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use, except for changing the colors, and the other compatibility issues seem to be caused by the international version?
I hope to learn Falun Gong.
It offers great value for money
I have used it 3-4 times already.
1. The packaging is intact.
2, It is very simple to use and easy to clean.
3. You can totally DIY your haircut and save money.
In summary, a very successful purchase.
There are fake goods
Last time I bought two packs, and they turned out to be two different versions. The words in the lower left corner of the packaging were originally green, but one of the packs had white words, and the cat ended up getting diarrhea after eating it.
I am not sure whether the goods from Amazon are fake or whether they were shipped out by the employees by mistake.
I will buy it again if it is still fake. If so, I will hold you responsible and seek compensation.
It's a slash!
The slash on Amazon's image is diagonal, but the one they sent me is horizontal. Isn't that misleading?
It's not bad
Cats like to eat, and this is the key.
And it does work.
Tight, narrow, pinches the feet, rubs the heels.
Not recommended.
1. The UN series is Clarks' most comfortable line, but this one is too bad.
Additional: Today I compared the previous UN series insoles (the shoes were thrown away but the insoles were kept) and found that the material is quite different from before, the elasticity is not as good as before, the breathability is not as good as before, and they are just fake soft.
2. My heel is not very high, and the pressure point is about 3 cm forward from the highest part of the heel.
3. I bought three pairs of Clarks abroad, but only one pair fits.
I deleted everything in my bookmarks folder out of fear.
Try Rockport if you're not satisfied. Otherwise, you can only go to the Ecco physical store.
Low quality masquerading as high quality, with poor quality control
First, it is worth noting that Prime's overseas shopping Ups is very powerful. I received my order on the 6th after placing it on the 31st.
The shoes are much more attractive in color than the picture, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is slightly larger than usual, 25 cm long and 10.5 cm wide, with a 7.5W sole. The fit is slightly loose, but I usually like to wear shoes that are a bit looser, so it's just right.
Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not something to brag about. One of the soles has a damaged rubber, and the other has various scratches and a needle hole, and the adhesive strip connecting the sole and the upper is misaligned, blatantly trying to pass off inferior goods as superior ones!
I feel a little regretful!
I bought it for 280 yuan during the promotion, which is quite a good deal for Arthurs. Of course, there are even lower prices if you check the comments.
Now let's talk about shoes. The advantages: The shoes are very light, running is quite comfortable, and they fit well, without being loose.
The appearance is very good, but there are also obvious drawbacks: I usually wear size 40 shoes, but this time I bought size 40.5, and the front of the shoes are about 1 finger width away from my feet when I put them on. However, this doesn't affect anything.
These shoes are "narrow," although there is still some room in front, but they feel tight.
Another thing is that the shoes may not be very breathable, and now I feel like my feet are very hot when I wear them.
Heel strike
First, the shoes are well made and worth the price.
My feet are the standard type, and my running shoes are UK 7.5, EU 41.5, my leather shoes are UK 6.5, and I have also bought a few pairs of Amazon's Altra shoes. I have never encountered a pair that doesn't fit my feet, but this pair, according to the reviews, I bought a size larger, UK 7, and when I tried them on, they were obviously too long because they were a size larger, but because the insole was too thick, they were very uncomfortable to wear, and the hiking shoes were also very hard, making it very difficult to put them on.
If your feet are not particularly slim, I would not recommend buying this one.
If you really have to buy them, changing the insoles can also solve the problem, but it's a pity not to use the original insoles, which look very high-end.
A very perfect shopping experience!
I am very satisfied and very happy. There is no doubt that Amazon Global Selling sells genuine products. The quality is also very good. The products are of high quality and reasonably priced. I can buy with confidence. The after-sales service is very thoughtful and the customer service is very friendly and approachable. They handle issues patiently and efficiently. They take care of all my worries after the purchase. The delivery service is very convenient and reliable. The delivery drivers are very considerate of the customers and always remind them to pick up the goods on time from the delivery box. I am grateful to Amazon for providing such a comfortable shopping experience for customers.
In short, we all love shopping on Amazon Global Shops!
Absolutely negative reviews!
I am speechless about this agency and Amazon.
After this, you should be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon.
Although it has been a long time since then, we still need to vent our frustrations.
I bought it in winter at a bargain price, less than 200, and it has been sitting in my house for several months without being used.
When I needed to use it in the spring, I found that it couldn't connect to the watchband no matter what. Both device manuals indicated that they supported each other, but later I found that it was probably a problem with the heart rate monitor, because I couldn't connect it to other devices either.
I called Amazon and asked them to contact the agent company, which asked me to send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
It took almost half a month for the package to be returned to me in its original condition, even the delivery box was the one I used when I sent it!
There are no replies, acknowledgements, or test reports!
At least tell me whether it's good or bad!
Call to ask and they said that sending it back like this indicates that the equipment is fine, which is good.
But I still can't connect, the agency replied: That's not their problem.
I'm unlucky, I don't want to go through the trouble of a 200 yuan item just for your sake.
There is a serious mismatch between supply and demand.
It's not quite right.
The headband material is very good.
It's much better than Nike.
It is also very breathable.
It's just the hat in front.
Very fine.
Are you here to tease me?!
It completely blocks the sun.
I did not return it because it works well as a headband.
Worn upwards, it doesn't really block the sun.
But it is different from other headband styles.
Keep it.
The goods are of good quality, and Amazon lacks a sense of contractual obligation. The delivery people are very good.
I require delivery on Saturday and Sunday!
Amazon's rules do not allow deliveries on Saturdays and Sundays.
I drove back 200 kilometers from the countryside just to pick up the goods because of you!
Amazon, how do I love thee?
The delivery person was very proactive and enthusiastic.
Give it a thumbs up!
The goods are simple to use and not bad at all.
However, you have never bought similar goods before, so you cannot compare prices!
Size and logistics
The workmanship is fine, but the logistics are too slow. Previously, all the shoes were shipped by DHL, but this time Apex is really... I've bought a lot of UA shoes in China, and the prices aren't low, but they seem to be at a higher level than NIKE and ADIDAS.
They're basically the same, so why not shop online?
Size: I am 176 cm tall and weigh 68 kg. My shoulders are usually 180 cm, so I bought an M. The hem is slightly longer than usual, but the rest fits just right. I saw that there was a recommendation for an S size, but my body is so slim, isn't it? Or do you prefer tight-fitting clothes? I think a loose-fitting hat would be better.
It's just right
Chest circumference 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, I consulted customer service before purchasing and was told I should buy XXL, but after reading the reviews, I bought L without hesitation and found that the size was just right when I received the goods. I almost fell into a trap.
The prices on Double Eleven are much higher than those on Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
Cheap goods are a real headache when it comes to quality!
The order placed on the 18th was only delivered on the 25th, and it was snail speed from Guangzhou to Beijing!
I bought the most affordable item, and the description said there were scratches, but when I received the item, I found that it was missing four screws and nuts!
The child did not want to return the item, thinking that there was nothing wrong with it, but the child's grandfather went to several hardware stores in the area and couldn't find the parts anywhere!
Finally, Grandpa got it!
It seems that we can no longer buy the most affordable goods in the future!
Toy manufacturing quality is poor
Most of the bolt holes were not aligned, and it was very difficult to tighten the bolts. This indicates that the manufacturing quality was not good, and I don't know how long it will last because it was a promise to my child. So I didn't return it.
Other comments say that the installation is easy, so why is there a problem with the one I bought?
Pretty normal
Am I just unlucky?
The packaging is beyond old-fashioned; the workmanship is very ordinary; the music is only one type and is only 8 seconds long and then repeats over and over again; the actions are just shaking your head and walking forward on your own, without any variation.
It's not worth it.
If it's urgent, then there's no need to return it.
The toy quality is good, but I have a few complaints about the packaging
I received a package yesterday, which I ordered from Amazon. It was marked as EMS delivery, and finally it was delivered by Taobao's courier service. How many twists and turns did it go through? Are Amazon and Taobao on good terms?
Let's talk about the packaging again. It was wrapped in several layers of plastic film, and there was not even a layer of packaging bubble wrap inside. When you open it, all the parts are packed loosely in an empty box, and it's fun to play with because the toy quality is good and there are no broken parts. It's just too big compared to what we imagined, because it doesn't have batteries, and when you push it, it often derails because the tracks are too wide and the design is unreasonable.
Good quality and fun to play
It's a lot of fun, the components are very precise, the workmanship is exquisite, and the quality is comparable to Lego's. The prices are very reasonable during promotional events.
The assembly process is quite interesting. I assemble it, and my 5-year-old son plays with it. It's pretty good.
He was laughing all the way through the game! He will probably continue to buy toys from this brand in the future.
The machine is new and the shopping from abroad is good
I checked the Christmas sales, and the one I bought earlier was 150 yuan more expensive, but the delivery is a bit slower now.
The machine is still pretty good, and they're all fairly new.
Built-in Pikachu.
If you connect the fairy ball, you will get a dream.
It's not bad to play, and it's more portable than the PS4.
I already bought Zelda, so I'll try it out later.
Producing substandard goods, selling substandard goods, and providing substandard service. I bought a six-piece watch set for my child, and one of the watches had an incomplete digital display, and the time on all six watches was not consistent, differing by up to 15 hours or more.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watches were checked for the time when they were put into storage. They replied that "they were." If they were checked, then why is the time so different? Clearly, the watches are not accurate, and in simple terms, they are counterfeit products. It's not what I said, but it's a very obvious quality issue (the display is not complete). They are selling garbage.
I contacted the seller, and the seller gave me a long list of reasons, and even complained that we shouldn't have bought their product in the first place. Such a product, such a seller, and such after-sales service. Who would dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future?
In short, I recommend that you do not buy anything from this seller. If you do, you will end up with junk.
Amazon shipping problems
After receiving the goods, inspection revealed:
1. The outer packaging is severely damaged.
2, The instruction manual has severe folding.
3, The watch does not work, and the desk lamp cannot be charged or used. It is also impossible to adjust the time.
4, Contact Amazon customer service separately. Shipping to the US is only possible at your own expense, and the shipping fee can be reimbursed later.
5, The reason for the 2 points is that the customer service is still quite good.
I can only say it's barely acceptable.
The time is not very accurate, it is off by about one second per day, and it has already been off by more than two minutes after only a few months of use.
I used to have a Seiko watch, and I felt that it wouldn't be off by a few seconds in a couple of years.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, but the timing function is a bit useless, and is rarely used. Occasionally, I accidentally touch the button to enter the timing mode.
Solar-powered sports watches
Advantages: There is no need to worry about replacing the battery when charging with solar energy, it has world time, various alarm tones, and a reminder at the top of the hour.
Drawbacks: The mirror is easily scratched and gets dusty.
Value for money: The domestic price is generally between 220 and 300, and it costs around 180 when purchased abroad (takes about one week).
A very satisfactory watch
It is definitely the genuine article. I checked the goods at the specialty store, and the watch has a very beautiful appearance and fine workmanship. The materials used are adequate, and it also has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight to it. It is far superior to those three or four hundred so-called mechanical watches, and it is genuine.
The watch's timekeeping is very accurate, and the error is completely within an acceptable range. There is a jewelry appraisal certificate in the watch's packaging, and the 12th letter on the dial is a real diamond. It is very suitable for me to wear it myself, and it is also a very dignified gift to give away.
Bentley watches are indeed quite good.
The worst shopping experience in history
On the evening of September 23, my wife's phone fell and broke. I was so excited that I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon, which had the item in stock but was not self-operated, and there was no mark-up (I was secretly delighted). However, since it was not self-operated, delivery took a while. The system showed that the estimated delivery date was September 27 at the latest.
My wife was miserable without a phone, so early the next morning at around 6:30 AM she called me and asked me to think of a solution. Later, when I went to JD.com, I found that there were 256GB models in stock that could be delivered the same day, so I immediately ordered another one.
The new one is ready, so I'm thinking of canceling my Amazon order right away.
Because the order was placed at midnight, it was not possible to pick up the package at 1 a.m. I called the customer service at around 7:30 a.m. to request cancellation of the order, and the customer service replied that the order had already been canceled and that I should wait for a text message notification.
Okay, I patiently waited until noon, then checked my phone and saw that the order was still in the status of not yet shipped. I immediately contacted customer service to request that the order be canceled as soon as possible, and the customer service representative replied that the operation was complete.
At 3 p.m. in the afternoon, I checked my phone and found that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact customer service again to confirm that it was the third time I had called, and asked them to cancel the order and notify the seller not to ship the goods!
The customer service contacted the seller at my request and informed me that the seller was unfamiliar with the system and that I should wait until they were familiar with it before canceling the order.
However, I was explicitly told by the seller that they have already known about this, and absolutely will not ship the item. Please be assured.
When I checked the order on Monday, I was speechless to find that it had already been shipped.
Because it is not possible to directly contact the seller, I had to call customer service again.
The subsequent processing was almost incomprehensible. Basically, I would say one step and the customer service representative would then perform a few operations.
The order is still in the status of refusal to receive, and is about to be resent!
Will Amazon not proactively follow up?
The seller company will get paid anyway, so it doesn't matter if they don't follow up.
After this experience, I will definitely not pay in advance for large items. It's too much of a hassle.
It looks very nice.
I had my eye on this camera for a long time, but because of other reasons besides the price, I didn't buy it. This time, because it was eligible for free shipping, the price was also acceptable, so I bought it.
After buying it, there were no problems with the rest of it, except that it was impossible to connect to the software. My home router is TP, and I tried connecting to the Internet to find out that many people had the same problem. It took me more than two hours to troubleshoot it, changing the router settings over and over again. In the end, I used 360 WIFI as a medium to connect the one that worked, and in the process I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have any solutions to this problem, so they just told me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.
Another thing worth noting is that I saw user comments online saying that the minimum storage capacity supported by this camera is 8GB, and if the storage capacity is smaller than that, the camera will not recognize it. Please pay attention to this.
It feels alright to use it, and the picture quality is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor, and the machine has a certain degree of heating. If it is left on continuously, the degree of heating feels a bit hard to accept.
As mentioned above, this product has many shortcomings, so please be careful when buying it.
I gave it 3 stars because this is the one I bought with my first love, with whom I had been dating for almost 3 years, and who left me last year, and is still doing so to this day.
I gave it 3 stars because this was the one I bought for my first love, and I don't know how much use I'll get out of it now, maybe I should just throw it away!
We had been together for almost three years, and then she left me last year, leaving me with a lifetime of grief and pain. The first woman in my life, she has left me with a shadow and heartache that I have not been able to shake off to this day.
When I bought this phone, I thought about the two feelings I had at the time. Now, looking back, it's a regretful experience, but perhaps that's just how life is. There are some people you never want to meet, and some things you never want to know about, but what can you do?
How many times have I thought of her when I see a Samsung phone? The pain that follows is so intense that it fills my entire body, and I have never been willing to spend more than 2,000 yuan on a phone, but when I bought one for her, I didn't hesitate for a moment. No matter how good a person is, when she changes her mind, all the oaths and promises are gone.
High-end products from domestic brands
Huawei is a gem among Chinese goods.
The low-key bosses and companies rely on technology and quality to win over customers, which is completely different from the current trend of relying on advertising to increase brand awareness!
Weak companies are simply incapable of doing this, and would not dare to do so!
It was for this reason that I chose Huawei.
I have used it for more than half a year now, and I feel that it is always good and very good.
The reason it did not get a perfect score is that there was once a situation where the offline navigation did not work properly, and I never figured out the reason. Otherwise, it works fine.
Moreover, its online input of the destination is good, and after the search, it automatically designs the route. Once you leave the Wi-Fi coverage area, its offline navigation function is very useful and does not consume data. It directly communicates with the satellites to achieve positioning and navigation, which is great!
Sony's law is good
Sony's low-end phone still has a great design, and it's also affordable. The screen is big enough, the battery life is great, and it's suitable for the elderly to use.
Although a long time has passed, this machine is still in good working order.
However, since my Z2 has been downgraded, this phone has also completed its mission.
