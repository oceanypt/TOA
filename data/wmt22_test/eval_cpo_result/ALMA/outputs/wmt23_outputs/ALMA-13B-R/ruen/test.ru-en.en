The July issue is traditionally handed in during the Moscow Film Festival, and it's of course very sad to have to proofread when your heart is longing for Chabrol.
However, we will tell you more about the MIFF next time (for now, I will only complain that this year, the organizers have finally fully internalized an inexplicable belief that ticket holders are infinitely more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite insulting principle that no normal film festival in the world would ever condone), and in this issue, we will report on what we saw in Cannes and at Kinotavr.
The cover of the July issue is adorned with yet another pleasant face - the lead character from the Robert Rodriguez-produced film Predators, and inside the magazine you'd better try not to miss the story about Christopher Nolan's The Beginning (a man, incidentally, who rebooted Batman...), the most - without a doubt - anticipated film of the summer.
We are also publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the works of Alfred Hitchcock this time around, and there is no need to advertise it in any special way, as it is obvious to everyone that the author of Suspicion and Rope is none other than our very own Tatiana Aleshicheva, Boris Gleizerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Joling, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergei Mesenov, Sergei Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Neva Pierce, Alexei Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Mur Sohlov, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Streltsov, Oleg Tishchenkov, Olga Shakina, Chris Hewitt, and Evelyn Salt, the London-based Cereusan, despite her impressive resume, were suspected of spying for the Russians and were determined to catch her at all costs.
Cornered, she will turn black again and go off on her own to find the truth.
The latest action movie with Angelina Jolie as a deadly femme fatale promises to further cement the actress's position in the action genre.
She will cause one traffic accident after another, run up walls like in The Matrix, and throw strong men dressed in identical formal suits around like children.
Beauty should save the world in much the same way.
Here he is, dear, the one who blew up and fixed the world in The Fifth Element and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superheroic guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and perfect embodiment of Evil.
And yet, all together it turned out to be not a tedious American-style blockbuster about saving the world, but a charming live carnival.
What Besson did for the 13 years between Element... and Adèle... is not something I want to remember.
He, to put it mildly, didn't sit idly by, but all that scriptwriting and producing hubbub and the rare, labored directorial appearances will be forgotten.
But "Adele..." is unlikely.
When watching this movie, it seems as though the 13 years before us were not our Besson, but some kind of double.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment on Montmartre, drank wine in a cafe across the street, and invented the story of the most charming adventure-seeker.
To recount the plot (even in broad strokes), while building up expectations, is a sin in this case more than usual.
Here, the whole incredible thrill lies in the fact that around every corner or line of dialogue, there are surprises waiting for you.
And they are all pleasant.
Either a girl or a vision
ADEL'S UNUSUAL ADVENTURES
The most daring adventure movie of the decade hints that The Extraordinary Journey of Adèle will start out like Amélie, veer towards Jurassic Park, continue with Indiana Jones and The Mummy, and end with Titanic.
The film is based on the first volume of comics by Jacques Tardi about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgeois appeared in only three films before Adèle.
The actress became famous for her role in The Girl from Monaco, for which she was nominated for a César Award.
The director does not chase the viewer with outstretched arms, begging them to appreciate special effects, sets, or stunts, but rather draws them in like an old-fashioned novelist, exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the ends of the world: "Come on, my reader, great deeds await us!"
Meanwhile, Besson treats genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, with a reckless and cheerful disregard, like a boy who has watched too many old films and read too much Jules Verne.
Manipulating the mundane, not denying oneself cynicism and not shying away from risk
DIRECTOR Luc Besson
STARRING: Louise Bourgoin, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Bel, Gilles Lellouche
PLOT: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city was shaken up by an ancient monster that was brought to life by an old medium.
The police are chasing after the prehistoric creature, as well as a famous hunter, a pair of scientists from the Museum of Natural History, and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has more to do with the beast than with the medium—she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy out of Egypt.
RELEASED ON JULY 22
"Adele..." is a case where parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre and is capable of radically changing it, sending it down a new path.
This was the case with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, Quentin Tarantino's gangster action films, the aforementioned "Indiana Jones" (which was both praised and parodied), and even "The Fifth Element."
Besson's style in this film is a combination of verbal trickery, actorly clowning, and plot gymnastics (circus terms are quite appropriate here - the union of the two arts is as natural and strong as ever).
A few words should also be said about Adele herself.
It embodied the unfairly forgotten type of adventuress who relies not so much on the exploitation of her sexuality, but rather on pure daring and courage.
In movies, girls like these are usually paired up with some macho sidekick or romantic lothario
TEXT: ALEKSANDRA STRELKOVA
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical sigher, who only dances under your feet (his knowledge of zoology turns out to be useful).
So, the energetic girl doesn't waste time on romantic nonsense, and instead cheerfully spends time in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on the numerous genre "cats" and seemingly completely spoiled, Luc Besson displayed unexpected creative daring, reminding us that the border between the preferences of bored mall-goers and the highbrow regulars of art-house cinemas is easily crossed with films for life-loving lunatics.
Playing adventure movies without sadness, fear, and reproach
DEATH ROOM
The hermetic horror film with a claim to psychological depth and political context, the 2002 debut horror film by Jonathan Liebesman, was panned by critics but was well-received by the public and did well at the box office, most importantly catching the eye of producer Michael Bay.
Thus, the young director ended up at the factory that was cooking up new horrors according to old recipes: Bay set out to remake all the classic horror films as remakes, and entrusted Libesman with the prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006).
The criticism wrinkled up again, but the audience liked it again – Libesman worked in the spirit of the "new terrifying ones," emphasizing the excessive physicality of the violence.
In his case, one can observe how an entire genre flounders in convulsions, trying to invent new ways to affect a jaded audience: the realistic gore of splatter movies merges with slasher chase scenes.
The plot resembles the Saw franchise, but without the gallons of blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincenzo Natali's debut film Cube. The film was made after Michael Bay.
So, in Room to Die, Libesman had to take a different path: the crude hacking or monotonous running away from the maniac was replaced by a smarter option—almost devoid of the infamous gore, but with psychological games and mysteries.
Evil doctors here play cat and mouse with the test subjects.
Three men in a locked room try to devise a survival strategy: to join forces or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or try to break out of your cell at any cost?
They are not the only ones being tested, but also a young, ambitious special services employee, who is being tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor well-versed in wild experiments.
STORY: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They put them in an isolated room and give each of them a stack of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then, a polite person in a white coat enters the room and introduces himself as a doctor, and shoots one of the test subjects in the head.
The game of survival begins, with government agents watching closely from behind the glass.
Too contemplative for a horror film, but not enough for outright arthouse
He can hold a secular conversation and give someone a fire extinguisher to the face, but he is unable to let a single skirt pass by.
Charming Anastasia, on the other hand, is cautious and resolute in her affections.
Offended by her father's courtly lifestyle, she openly spies on him as he, like a parody of Paul Verhoeven's famous scene from Showgirls, dives into the pool in search of another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, while the father tempts her young lover from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not the generation gap or the choice of profession, which is already predetermined in one way or another. The unsuccessful attempts of the girl to refute the obvious idea that everything in modern Moscow can be bought and sold become the main topic of the conflict.
Mger Mkrtchan, together with Pavel Bardyn, filmed the comedy Three and a Snowflake with Ivan Urgant, a melodramatic film with a slow pace.
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of a maturing daughter in the comedy genre
The fragmented plot revolves around the romantic adventures of the characters, who constantly discuss psychology, and themselves, apparently thanks to a clever directorial touch, focus on the language of the eyes and gestures.
Secondary plot lines (the injured girl that Alexei wants to marry after a car accident, played by Sergey Gorobchenko as an alcoholic athlete), alas, are only sketched out in outline.
Especially regrettable is the line about the business of buying and selling football players, which was left out.
PLOT: The fate of the agent's underage daughter Nastya is what concerns him most in the world.
The kind-hearted dad changes wives like expensive shirts, but his daughter is just about to turn eighteen, and she absolutely must marry a man with a backbone.
How disappointing for the businessman when Anastasia, in her quest for independence and in defiance of her father, chooses her peer and business partner.
However, the author hit the mark with a potential slogan for the film's audience: "Don't look for a problem where there isn't one." Couldn't be more accurate.
Their similarity is simply astounding.
In both films, there are units of tough guys, soldiers of fortune, who are forced to avenge those who betrayed them, and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
The heroes jump almost to the same parts of the world (both films start in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same eye-catching shots - in both films, something explodes filled with dollar bills, and a tornado of dollars descends on the set.
Even the villains, dressed in fancy costumes, are hard to tell apart (they are played by Patrick in both cases, Patrick Wilson here and Jason Patrick there).
Zoë Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylven White previously made movies about dance battles - "Step Up."
Chris Evans was recently asked to play a character from other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a comic book series that came out in the 70s and was relaunched in the 2000s, Joe Carnahan - by a comedy series from the 80s.
It's simply amazing how they, without coordinating, brought different material to an absolutely identical booming signature, making fairly heavy, predictable, and unnecessary action movies that evoke a plethora of images of Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably favor Bruce and Arnold).
If you had to choose between these two tapes, "Losers" looks a little bit more attractive and definitely more victorious in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times smaller).
At least here there is Zoe Saldana, who looks great in a bazooka
STARRING: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoë Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
PLOT: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of battle-hardened commandos working for the CIA was betrayed by their own superiors: the helicopter carrying the children they were trying to rescue was blown up, and the soldiers have been considered dead since that moment.
But they are alive - and they are determined to exact revenge on the villain with the mellifluous voice who orchestrated all of this.
All this is nice, but to be honest, it's only worth spending 1.5 hours of your life on White's film if you have absolutely no better options.

A simple story about a Romanian fugitive convict
In a Romanian low-budget film that won an award at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, having only these data at hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the painting, as well as some specific details of its form.
There is no doubt that the film will be highly socially conscious.
Of course, it will be realistic, but also tough.
There is a high probability of the involvement of amateur actors.
There will also be a lot, a lot of Romanian poverty (yes, poverty doesn't discriminate by nationality, but Romanian poverty, as our festival laureates have proven film by film, is particularly dire).
Also, without knowing the year of release, it is easy to mistake what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who in the early 1980s were given a lecture on Bresthenson
The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on a play by Andreea Valceanu, whose work is particularly popular among Romanian "new wave" directors.
Operator Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumbayu.
All of the above is true and applies to Florin Serban's debut work, and - understand us correctly - is by no means a derogatory but rather a commendatory assessment: Romanian "new wave" is at that blissful stage of development when its representatives have faith in the methods
Her work has not wavered yet.
And this moment must be seized: it is only thanks to this faith that one can endure the 1.5-hour spectacle of the Romanian colony for minors and succumb to the charisma of the most talented Pistiranu (whose story, despite the chasm separating two cultures, can be easily
convert into an exploitation à la 70s, with a cowboy who has decided to take a stroll from the prison where he is soon to be released, to the nearest saloon).
STARRING: Georg Pistorian, Ada Condescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
PLOT: Having served his four years, 18-year-old inmate Silvio (Pistorian) is soon to be released, but unexpectedly discovers that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this point on, the young man's behavior becomes inappropriate.
The flirtation with social worker Anna pushes the boy to even more desperate actions, the meaning of which is encapsulated in the title of the film.
What a load of nonsense!
If you want to watch, watch.
A decent debut that gives a faint hope that one day Romanian arthouse cinema will become a respectable genre
An animated film about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-author Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, who is responsible, among other things, for all the "Ice Age" films, "Horton" and "Robots."
"Ugly Me" is probably the team's best work: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it's worth watching in 3D), especially if you like when various objects keep trying to jump out of the screen and into the auditorium, the script is decent, and most importantly, there are no below-the-belt jokes that made you have to blush and cover your child's ears at "Ice Age."
Of course, the reason for the change in course was not the authors' lack of restraint, but the protagonist's glaring asexuality, which in turn is dictated by a desire to avoid any mention of pedophilia whatsoever.
For the "adult" part, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, there is fairly dark humor (which we can probably thank the director Coffin for).
Overall, it's a very pleasant film - to the extent that it becomes almost too perfect and right at some point.
One can feel the meticulous work of a well-coordinated team of marketers, who thought of every detail to make the film appealing to all categories of citizens.
We don't really want to see the heroes of a children's cartoon eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic bomb
PLOT: The mustachioed villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of becoming an astronaut have transformed over the years into the idea of stealing the moon to carry out his grand scheme and eliminate his young rival, is forced to enlist the help of children to carry out his plan.
In some advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans: Margo with glasses, Edith with a hat, and Agnes, whose cuteness is comparable only to the cat from Shrek.
As is usually the case, children quickly transform adult plans.
The main character is based on Christopher Melendandri - both are bald, have big noses, and have a penchant for black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
In the finale, Gru dances Travolta's part
Somewhere in the middle of the hypothetical desert, a truck pulls up to an abandoned trailer, and out of it emerge three pairs of the finest tits you've ever seen.
That's right.
The bearers of this gift in themselves are not so significant.
The camera confidently focuses on this part of the body.
For those who appreciate it, we have good news right away: the entire film is in the same vein.
Rick Jacobson understands the finer points of female beauty better than anyone else, and the casting was done in such a way that what is happening on the screen is secondary.
And a lot of funny things happen.
"Broker," "killer," and "stripper" dig in the sand, get splashed with water (don't ask why), spout nonsense, and periodically completely savagely fight each other.
The creators believe that a swearing cow with generous curves, covered in mud, with a broken nose and shining white teeth is cool.
"Bitchy Things" is primarily aimed at classic sexploitation films.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of "Xena: Warrior Princess" and "Hercules: The Amazing Journeys."
A similar-spirited film is currently in Moscow theaters, "The Gun for Jennifer."
It's also cool when the bitchy beauty gives the gangster a hard time, the punk dude fights alongside a Japanese schoolgirl, and there's a samurai sword and lesbian sex; and the plot unfolds through an infinite number of flashbacks.
In general, for a cinema-fetishist, this place is a real treasure trove of pleasures.
Of course, it's obvious that Jacobson and his gang were having a blast filming this trash parody, but the task itself seems rather strange in and of itself.
If not for the physical attributes of the actresses, it would have become boring by the middle.
One can assume that this trash came to us from the adult nighttime channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
STARRING: Julia Whelan, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hirst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring the head of the mafia to the desert, where his diamonds worth a substantial amount are hidden somewhere.
Having achieved nothing and shooting the unfortunate gangster, the girls start to fight with each other, claw at each other, and occasionally with the periodically arriving thugs from somewhere, as well as regularly kissing and hugging each other.
As the story progresses, it becomes clear that all three are not who they appeared to be at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even funnier that way.
A product for a small group of aficionados of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his last film, "Judgment Day," the watered-down "Mad Max" for the poor, Marshall made a serious misstep
The bloodthirsty and vicious peplum film restores the director's shaken trust.
The new unapologetically non-PC and gloomy magnum opus doesn't shy away from a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration, and the savage aesthetics of B-movie brutality.
There is also the rowdy bravado of "Dogs of War" and the animalistic brutality of "The Descent."
The Marshall Plan for cleansing "peplum" of the post-gladiatorial cinematic sludge, in general, worked.
In 2011, Kevin MacDonald will present his interpretation of the Ninth Legion story.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (among others, the surprisingly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough guys trying to reconcile their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
Murder and salacious details of going to the bathroom in ancient times are depicted here with love and detail.
The scene of the Ninth Legion's destruction, which cost a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the opening scene in the now iconic Gladiator by Sir Ridley Scott, set in German forests, but for some reason it doesn't feel right to accuse Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without complaints.
STARRING: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrisey
PLOT: The lands of modern Scotland occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The remote outpost where centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is stationed is mercilessly destroyed by a Pict scouting party.
Miraculously surviving, Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, along with a group of other surviving Romans, try to escape from a band of Pictish militants led by the sadistic Etain (Kurylenko).
So far, the thin art-house actor has only managed to win a few sharply characterized supporting roles in Hollywood, but one very much hopes that after Centurion, the situation will change.
Pulpum is an edited and expanded edition.
Almost like Gladiator, but more modest and austere
The continuation of the story about the schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationship with two extremely promising young people—the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf-bodybuilder Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
The large-scale cinematic adaptation of the animated series about the bald boy wizard called upon to bring peace to four kingdoms.
The Lord of Fire waged a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang can stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
Cobbs's house (Leonardo DiCaprio) can steal other people's thoughts, and he works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
Penetrating the target's sleep, it forces the sleeping brain to work according to its own rules.
But this time he has to do the opposite—leave something in one head that wasn't there before.
A beautiful lesson in managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicolas Cage) finds himself a young assistant in the hope of overcoming the evil wizard (Alfred Molina) together.

A group of hardened thugs led by the weak-looking Royce (Adrien Brody) mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where they become the target of a sporting hunt by stylish toothed aliens.
The return of a cult character from the 1980s to the big screen.
Take note of George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-turned-director Anton Corbijn ("Control") for a rather interesting existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding from people in a small Italian town and belatedly coming to terms with human nature.
"The visionary artist on the scale of Corbijn and the magnificent George Clooney - this is a cinematic union made in heaven," boasts the studio press release.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of Clooney's longest love affair in life - with Italy: filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Taking Martin Booth's novel Very Private Gentleman as a starting point, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the English narrator was replaced by the American featured in the title, and the gunsmith-turned-illegal became a simple killer.
Otherwise, the story is similar to the original: while hitman Jack tries to wrap up his last job and finally quit the lucrative profession, his icy heart melts under the charm of the local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tecla Ruten), into which the Culkin character instantly falls in love.
"Jack tempts fate," says the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is approaching him ever closer, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well not be who she claims to be."
Judging by the trailer, Korbyn's visual experiments, seasoned with Culkin's ashy locks (the film resembles a long 02 music video), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the lead role in the film adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front by Remarque
Or can I just snap you with my camera gun?
This season, Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at the same time.
First, in Venice, on the set of the thriller The Tourist by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (Life of Others), there are three.
There he plays a heroin-loving tourist in love with Angelina Jolie's character.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico, on the set of The Rum Diary, the film adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The director and screenwriter of the project is Bruce Robinson ("Whitnail and I"), whose last directorial work was the thriller "Jennifer 8" in 1992.
Looking at the work of the placard-wavers in the domestic prison drama, one can even doubt that they were inspired by anything.
But you can't take the idea of implementation literally!
At least, it's good that the heroine of the Russian film, although a foreigner, is not completely bald.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They have already completed four joint projects: Gilmore Girls, Big Daddy, Chuck & Larry: The Wedding Crashers, and Don't Mess with the Zohan.
In July, the fifth comedy, "Classmates," comes out, and the sixth is in production, "The Big Lie" with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
The schedule also includes the seventh film, the romantic comedy Jack and Jill, in which Sandler plays both Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, who impressed viewers this year with the spectacular action film Kick-Ass, will be in charge of the X-Men reboot.
In the film X-Men: First Class, the director first called James McAvoy, assigning him the role of the young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the mutant telepath Emma Frost, aka the White Queen, Amber Heard will transform into the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender is expected to become Magneto.
While filming of the new Bondian series is postponed, its new director Sam Mendes doesn't have time to get bored.
On his list of accomplishments are the musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the adaptation of Iain M. Banks' novel The Wopsicle Halo.
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman considers the role of the practical Major George Smiley - the main character in John le Carré's series of novels - in the adaptation of the thriller Spy, Get Out!
In the first adaptation of this work in 1979, Alec Guinness played the role.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film Let Me In.
Tom Tykwer adapts the fantasy bestseller Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell.
According to the director, this is a difficult (there are six parallel storylines in the novel), but extremely interesting task.
Offers have already been made to Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, and Natalie Portman by him.
In Crimea, filming is underway for Maxim Korostyshevsky's international action film under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune."
It is dedicated to millionaires who went to real war at their own expense in search of adrenaline.
Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oxana Korostyshevskaya, and others are in the cast.
The film premiere is scheduled for the beginning of 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy Baby Jesus alongside English pop star Pixie Lott
Megan Fox was fired from Transformers 3
According to Ragotype Film Company, the dismissal "is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler."
Nevertheless, the role of the main heroine and the new love interest of Shia LaBeouf is most likely to be taken by English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
The girl has no experience in film, so she will have to take accelerated courses in acting technique.
This fact should not scare the seasoned viewer - there are plenty of examples in cinema history of successful rebranding of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monster"), Angelina Jolie ("A Mighty Heart"), Jessica Lange ("Blue Sky", "Tootsie"), Kim Basinger ("L.A. Confidential"), Jennifer Connelly ("A Beautiful Mind"), Gina Davis ("Random Hearts") and "Miss USA 1986 First Runner-Up" Halle Berry ("Monster's Ball") started out as models or appeared in fashion magazines, and eventually won well-deserved Oscars.
They have excelled in acting (also the beautiful Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci, and especially our compatriot Olga Kurylenko).
High awards are clearly within their reach.
In short, Rosie has plenty of people to look up to.
Valeria Gai Germanika, who received a Special Mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film "Everyone Will Die, But I Will Remain," and who directed the controversial TV series "School," has been appointed creative director at MT TV channel.
Channel management believes that Valeriya is the one who will be able to bring about the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, plans are already underway to film a series of its own (about teenagers or vampires).
Germania also began casting new hosts.
The comedy "Kolotilo" by director Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "Wacky Races."
The main theme of the film remains the same—the provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) rushes to Moscow to meet his fiancée, but gets delayed to train a football team of street kids.
The second plot line of the film has received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaxina, the role of the Moscow bride Nada will be played by Milla Jovovich.
As an additional plot twist, the third character, former fiancé of Nadya Danilova (Ivan Urgant), will appear.
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the street team will win the football championship, there is a dilemma about who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays in filming The Hobbit and the presence of a plethora of other projects, Guillermo del Toro declined the director's position.
Studios are trying to persuade producer Peter Jackson to take full control of the project, but he is only willing to agree to this step in the event of an emergency.
As possible successors, David Yates, who has finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neill Blomkamp, whose film "District 9," produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination, are named.
The new director's name will officially be announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Overwhelmed by a tight schedule, harsh criticism, and filmmakers rushing between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings and master classes were held, and the "Jewel" hotel, where press conferences and roundtables were in full swing, they barely had time to dive into the Black Sea.
The contestants' heroes behaved similarly as well - almost everyone was running somewhere in almost every film: the confused Asians from Yusup Razykov's Gastarbeiter and Dmitry Mamuliya's Other Heaven were looking for their missing grandson and wife, while the fugitive gangster from Yuri Bykov's Zhit ran away from the law.
The same cops were skillfully outwitted by the hero of Klim Shipenko's detective film Who Am I? — who, however, is better remembered by the public for the presence of the totally naked Yana Frisk in the frame.
Homegrown showbiz heroes appeared in a couple of competition films, including Sergey Shnurov as a long-distance truck driver transporting a circus animal to slaughter in the film The Elephant, and Evgeny Grishkovets pondering his favorite topics—female betrayal, male loneliness, and the healing power of alcohol—in the two-hander film Satisfaction, where business partners challenged each other to an alcohol duel over a woman.
However, business events at Kinotavr also had a distinct showbiz flavour—there was never a dull moment at any of them.
At a roundtable dedicated to the fate of Russian arthouse cinema, Sergei Tolstikov, the head of the Russian Film Foundation, staged a fiery confrontation with critics: "Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?" he angrily asked those present.
"I write them," confusedly replied the president of ERVEZS!, Andrey Plahov.
The scandals did not end there: closer to the end of the festival, the competition program suddenly dropped Aleksey Fedorchenko's film Ovchinniki - it will go to Venice: the Mostra selectors decided that an extra Russian screening was an obstacle.
Previously, the KinoTavr festival did not bother the giants - in Sochi, films from major festivals have been shown on numerous occasions: this time, for example, the film by Sergei Loznitsa, "My Happiness," was entered into the competition, having previously competed with Mikhalkov and Virasethakun at the Cannes Film Festival in the spring.
Nikita Sergeevich visited a film by a former Cannes competitor at Kinotavr and said that he liked it.
Chairman of the jury Karen Shakhnazarov, on the other hand, did not like Loznitsa's film at all — but under pressure from his colleagues, he was forced to award it a prize for direction.
The award for Best Debut - Lost Without a Trace - was awarded to the daughter
A terrifying encyclopedia of Russian life: the innocent, humane, and rational hero is beaten, robbed, and provoked into committing monstrous acts for no apparent reason.
A precisely crafted, purifying film experience shot by a misanthrope with a mathematical education that calls for only one thing - start thinking.
The debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia quotes Mamedashvili in his films, avoids any events in the script, and claims that the viewer's joy is in the effort to understand his inaccessible meditative films.
The most complex film at Kinotavr has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition – a directorial star is born.
The impeccably dressed and groomed programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the burrow of his tidy bachelor existence.
But a cast-iron babushka descends on the house, the hero's head is struck by the unjust hand of the punitive authorities, and he begins a meaningless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"It's sometimes useful to work not only with debutants," triumphantly declared producer Sabina Yeremeyeva from the stage as she accepted the award.
Critics saw it differently: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull an "inner debutant" out of the veteran of domestic art cinema.
And this is symptomatic—nowadays, in our cinema, the aurochs follow the youth.
And not the opposite at all.
Documentary films that are shot in a way that blows your mind more than similar artistic ones.
The author is interested in both the screwdriver investigating the electric meter and the piece of unsalted butter floating around the cast-iron skillet — all of this turns the story of the unemployed miner, his rare-toothed girlfriend, and her criminal brother into a real oil painting.
Short film competition winner Nikolai Sokolov applies the black-and-white aesthetic of the French New Wave to the world of sleepy suburbs.
Let the Gogolian digressions in the story of two schoolboys, one of whom dreams of making a bomb, and the other of playing Bach backward, seem strange, but for the rare attempt at poeticizing the surrounding reality, thanks.
"Three times a year - before Victory Day, Russia Day, and City Day - up to ten aircraft of the An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24 types are launched into the sky, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means for cloud modification and carrying special eco-friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide ("dry ice"), meteorological pyrotechnics with silver iodide, and powdered reagents.
The process looks like this: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and strength of the rain front) "break up" the clouds heading for the city with these agents. Particles of the substances condense moisture around them.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned, and exactly in the place where the cloud was affected."
For over ten years, work has been underway on a remake of the science fiction film in which Michael York played the lead role.
Recently, Karl Rinsch (who has a remake of The Thing from the Black Lagoon already scheduled in his schedule) was appointed director, who is famous for his advertising videos.
Previously, the project was associated with the names of Brian Singer ("X-Men"), James McTeigue ("V for Vendetta"), and Joseph Kosinski ("Tron: Legacy").
The plot follows a character who, at the age of thirty, is forced to flee a death sentence as the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching that age.
Robert Rodriguez acquired the rights to an 80s rotoscoped fantasy animated film and plans to make it into a big-screen movie.
The original was the product of the creative collaboration of director Ralph Bakshi (The Lord of the Rings, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic, and a lot of drawn boobs.
In it, the warrior Larn saves the princess Tigra and the entire nation from the evil ruler of the ice, Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to pay special attention to creating non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the time being, as he himself plans to take on a remake of the classic giallo film by Dario Argento.
The heroes will return to the big screen courtesy of none other than Michael Bay, the master of action, explosions, and horror remakes.
The director of the remake will be Damin Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Argento and Romero have already collaborated on Day of the Dead and filmed Two Evil Eyes together in 1990.
This time around, Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the script.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy Arthur
"I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the situation in China," says Chen.
- Chinese women today manage large businesses and win Olympic gold medals.
Hong Li embodies this power."
For the second time in a row, you are playing an imaginary character.
Is this a coincidence?
A pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I am presenting two films here (at Kinotavr and the Sochi Film Market - EMRBE).
And in both I play the dream woman.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he presented me, and many probably think that I am like that in real life.
A girl of dreams.
Your film partner Alexander Yatsenko is completely unlike his character.
How did you find common ground? What's he like on set?
He is completely different from what he seems at first glance.
At first, I saw him and thought, "Yeah... I'm not just going to get away with it."
Without genuine and authentic human contact, I guess we wouldn't have achieved anything.
And this contact happened to us literally within a few minutes of meeting.
We got along really well, if I may say so.
I told him about all my fears, all my worries, that I was afraid that I wouldn't succeed, and I asked him for advice and help, and he willingly gave me that advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
And so, at the premiere, we watched the whole film holding hands.
How did the filming in Sevastopol go?
Sevastopol is the city where I arrived for the first time.
I have never had any performances there, nor have I ever gone there on vacation or as a child.
This city has a special magic, its own character and charisma.
And it's a city you want to come back to.
It has its own provincial charm.
A place where nobody is in a hurry and where everything always gets done on time.
It seems you found it easy to play up your love for this city.
In general, you are extremely natural on screen, which many, to be honest, did not really expect.
How do you work with roles?
Do you find it easy to perform emotional scenes?
You know, I'm an amateur actor.
And I am, by nature, a very trusting person.
If I come and agree to work with a director, I am, in essence, entrusting myself to his hands, and I want to be a moldable piece of clay that he can shape.
I perfectly understand that from the outside it looks strange, and again, I ask for advice and talk to the director for a very long time, even though it's not me who's talking to him, but him to me, as he conducts preliminary discussions and explains to me in the most precise and accurate way what he needs.
And then, through long, multi-hour rehearsals, we arrive at that organic thing that you're talking about.
And how did you work with the film's director, Klim Shipenko?
I enjoyed working with everyone, the director, the producer, the operator, and Sasha Yatsenko.
Because it's so nice to work with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready to not sleep, not eat - and here it was exactly the same situation.
Not sleeping or eating for days on end - it doesn't matter, it's like thunder and lightning.
And if something didn't work out, it was a catastrophe, and something had to be done urgently to make it work.
In this atmosphere of madness, it's very easy to work.
And I think that when people are so driven to the point of painful fanaticism about what they do, it can't not work, because too much energy is expended.
Which scenarios do you refuse?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don't want nonsense, stupid dialogue, films that say nothing and mean nothing.
I don't want to work just to appear on the screen again.
Do you have any proposals, projects that you plan to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals or plans at the moment.
I'm not the kind of person who draws up schedules.
The script came along, it interested me, and today this premiere took place.

While we are working on the November issue, film festivals in Moscow are almost non-stop: the American film festival "Amfest", "2togo\", and recently "2-t-1" will start soon, followed by the British film festival.
And here's what's interesting: half of my acquaintances are constantly discussing the need to boycott someone and support someone else, all based on - well, excuse me - very vague considerations.
Meanwhile, when one of these festivals is ceremoniously closed with a horrific-looking Chu4 projection without English subtitles, nobody seems to notice.
The last thing you want to do is complain about this, but if you buy a ticket and stay in the room to watch the giant pixels and horizontal figures of the actors, that's what they'll show you.
Meanwhile, in the other room, there are no pixels to be found: Tron: Legacy (a sequel to the classic film about virtual reality), Let Me In. Saga (an American remake of the wonderful Swedish film), Unstoppable (another approach by Tony Scott to the theme of trains), and a very detailed account of how the Conan the Barbarian films were made, about the barbarian, destroyer, and governor.

the multi-part fairy tale about the cute wizard with glasses is nearing its end.

In the studios, by the way, there are no fools: in order to stretch out the viewers' enjoyment and squeeze the maximum out of the franchise at the end, the seventh film was decided to be split into two parts.

SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, above all, a story about a paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools of the Internet that united the world, drove five friends apart, and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire of the past decade.
Jesse Eisenberg in the lead role is just as brilliant as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg launches the site for a whole range of reasons: partly because of his anger at the world, partly because of his sporting interest, and partly just because it's "cool."
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and unplanned, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of The Social Network become apparent from the very first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara), who broke up with him less than five minutes ago: Aaron Sorkin's sharp, hard-hitting dialogue gains strength here and doesn't soften until the very end.
The same is true of Fincher's direction: relatively restrained, except that the Winklevoss twins were played by actors who were very different from each other.
The face of one of them was superimposed onto the other using computer graphics.
At the same time as Zuckerberg, Natalie Portman studied at Harvard.
Rooney Mara has been cast in the lead role in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
DIRECTOR David Fincher
STARRING: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rumer Willis, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Joshua Pence
PLOT: The gloomy and withdrawn Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having received a setback on the personal front, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grew, relationships with a few close companions began to deteriorate and eventually led to legal proceedings.
The color palette plays its part: warm, at times sunny, and remaining cozy even in the dark, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two isolated legal disputes.
Outside of the endless stream of discussions in the film, not much else happens: no deaths, no murders, and Mark Zuckerberg's legal troubles are unlikely to warrant even a paragraph in his sparse Wikipedia page.
What attracted the 49-year-old Sorkin and the 48-year-old Fincher to this rather sketchy story?
After watching, there is a persistent feeling that The Social Network is a portrait of our time, and the incompleteness in this case is an important artistic device.
Just twenty years ago, "Wall Street" was doing pretty much the same thing, only on a larger scale - with space egos and big deals.
Now that daily solvency has become even higher, policy is no longer implemented at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, dreams of being the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
Meanwhile, the Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence) are stomping their feet: who said that rich, beautiful, and athletic people can't also be smart?
(This line especially amuses Fincher.)
If desired, Social Network could easily have been a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more prevalent in his case - the positive or the negative?
And what social consequences will its invention entail?
Is he a con artist?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if there is even the slightest hint of anything like that.
But here, it's not even necessary: In their version of the story, it's not at all important.
"What is it like to feel beautiful?" is asked in the Tre VeaNez song "Vabu Wot'te A Vsp Map," preceding the credits.
The hero doesn't know.
The film suggests an answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of the lost online generation, which has a weak understanding of beauty and an even weaker understanding of feelings.
A well-made drama of character about a high-profile court case in the internet era
In the early 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames for people of humble origins were only just beginning to appear.
They were referred to as "son of such-and-such, such-and-such."
That is, patronymics—nicknames based on the father's name—were in use.
However, in some cases, such as in the case of a father's second marriage, the matronym—a nickname based on the mother's name—was used.
Susanin is a case in point: "Ivan, son of Susan."
Serfs of small landowners really did go without surnames for a long time - what was the point when you had 20 souls and everyone was always in sight?
But owners of vast estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Thus, the serfs of Prince Andrey Cherkassky already in the early 18th century all had surnames.
In the 19th century, even minor landowners did not keep peasants on the land, but sent them to pay tribute—let them earn a living through their trade and pay their landlord.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where the surname was to be entered.
In Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released on a tithe system following the abolition of serfdom.
So they already had surnames.
Capital crime scene investigators flew in to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Forensic experts from the central office and staff from the Forensic Expert Center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the gas explosion at House No. 39 on Liniya Street, reports NGS.
According to the investigation, the accused, Irina Urbach and Evgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization "Mezhregiongaz", inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality parts, worked carelessly, and overpriced their services, the agency reports, citing a well-informed source.
The day before the tragedy, a man and a woman visited three apartments in house No. 39, where they changed the hoses on the stoves.
For example, in one of the apartments, they installed a water hose instead of a gas one.
However, Kavun denies this.
According to him, this is impossible; everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a leak and explosion of a gas-air mixture occurred in one of the apartments.
Two stairwells collapsed, one completely and the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, resulting in the deaths of 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of the explosion in a house in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg, it was possible to avoid a sea flood caused by a storm surge

The flooding was prevented thanks to the dam closure the day before. Specialists were able to do this.
On Friday, the flood risk in St. Petersburg sharply increased due to the bad weather in the city.
The sea flood caused by the storm surge was prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
A potential flood could have been the 32nd in a row, reports the St. Petersburg publication Nevada.Tudey.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of sluices in the Gulf of Finland, the water stayed at the level of 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (between 161 and 210 centimeters).
The weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which occasionally reached 20-25 meters per second.
The dam has now been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can once again sail in the Gulf of Finland.
We note that the water level situation is monitored by ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This allows for the prevention of flooding that may follow the strengthening of the wind.
In Turkey, 8 people have been arrested in the case of deficiencies in the collapsed buildings
In the Turkish province of Şanlıurfa, eight people have been arrested in connection with construction defects found in buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake.
Armenpress reports that Habertürk is the source of this information.
As a result of the earthquake registered in Turkey on February 6, more than 20,000 people died.
The number of wounded exceeds 80,000.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
After the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 on the Richter scale, hundreds of underground tremors were felt not only in the 10 Turkish provinces, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of Iran and the President of the country
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Seyyed Ali Khamenei and President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Ebrahim Raisi on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenpress reported this in the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
In a message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Seyyed Ali Khamenei, it says:
Your Excellency,
I heartily congratulate you on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenian-Iranian warm and friendly relations with ancient roots, a rich history, and traditions are of special importance for the two of our countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing sustained and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am sure that the Armenian-Iranian friendly relations, forged in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will achieve even greater successes in the future for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran.
Taking the opportunity, I wish you good health and many years of life."
In the congratulatory message sent to Ebrahim Raisi, in particular, it says: "Your Excellency, accept our heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
The indestructible Armenian-Iranian relations based on a centuries-old history and mutual respect have a special significance for the Republic of Armenia.
I am confident that through our joint efforts we will be able to take interstate cooperation to a new level, with a multi-sectoral agenda that will be even more expanded for the benefit of the prosperity of our two friendly peoples and the security of our countries.
Stressing the importance of our perceptions regarding the establishment and strengthening of regional peace and stability, I reaffirm the official invitation addressed to you during my visit to Tehran last year to visit Armenia.
Taking the opportunity, I wish you new achievements, and the friendly people of Iran - lasting peace."

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, on Friday an aerial bomb from the Second World War exploded, which sappers were trying to defuse.
A powerful explosion was heard dozens of kilometers away, but there were no victims.
The Norfolk Police Department announced that, though the explosion was unplanned, no military personnel involved in disarming the bomb were injured.
The device detonated shortly after work began to neutralize it.
Fortunately, all personnel are safe.
The agencies have begun assessing the damage," said Nick Davison, assistant chief constable of Norfolk Police, to journalists.
Local residents write on social media that the explosion shook houses up to 24 km away.

Caption to the photo: The explosion occurred despite the sappers' plans, but there were no fatalities or injuries
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction works on the banks of the River Yar, at the mouth of which, on the shores of the North Sea, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before attempting to deactivate the bomb, the sappers built a protective sand berm around it, and the cordon, inside which outsiders were not allowed, was set up at a distance of 200 meters.
Bomb disposal experts initially, as early as Thursday, attempted to cut the detonator off the bomb using a robot, but the attempt failed, so they then decided, according to local press, to use the technique of "slow burning" explosives.
During this burning process, an explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, known as "Blitz", over 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, Belta reported, citing Aleся Solovei, a researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences.
The share of women among candidates of sciences and doctors of sciences is also growing: women make up 41.1% of candidates of sciences, and 21% of doctors of sciences.
In all areas of science, except for the technical ones, the share of women exceeds 50%.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is the medical sciences, where women make up 64.4% of the workforce.
Only in the technical sciences do men predominate, with women making up 26.7%.
At the National Academy of Sciences, the share of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is more than the national average by 10.2%.
Among the candidates of sciences, the proportion of women is 46%, among doctors of sciences, it is 20%.
Among the professorial and teaching staff in higher education institutions, more than half are women (57%).
Among the deputy rectors for scientific, educational, and pedagogical work, one third are women (31.8%), among deans, 38.7%, among deputy deans, 44.6%, and among department heads, 42.5%.
The majority of senior lecturers and professors are women, over 60%.
A high proportion of women are also among the associate professors on the faculty departments (55.2%).
According to the public opinion survey conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, most Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
With the gender stereotype "science is a male domain" to some extent, 63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree.
More than half of the country's population does not agree with the opinion that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"The transformation of gender perceptions of women's research competence in the mass consciousness promotes the involvement of young women in science, the development of their creative potential, the formation of a successful female scientist role model, including through the transfer of experience and mentorship," noted Alessa Solovey.
Every year on February 11, International Day of Women and Girls in Science is celebrated.
The holiday was established to encourage the involvement of women and girls in the field of science, to encourage the development of women's scientific careers, and to recognize the achievements of women in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world. -0-
The likelihood of an increase in the key interest rate in the future is higher than its decrease
Such a statement was made by Elvira Nabiullina, Chair of the Bank of Russia, following the Council of Directors meeting on February 10, which decided to keep the rate at the level of 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have occurred recently.
On the one hand, external trade conditions have noticeably deteriorated—the price of Russian oil has fallen.
On the other hand, the economic situation is better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment slows down, but budgetary spending is growing.
Meanwhile, inflationary risks have generally increased.
Therefore, in the current year, the likelihood of an increase in the rate exceeds the likelihood of a decrease.
The appropriateness of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of budgetary policy, she noted three risks.
First, a rapid increase in consumption in the context of heightened inflationary expectations, if the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is an ever-increasing shortage of labor and a lag in the growth of labor productivity relative to wage growth.
And there is still a risk of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the earlier noted strengthening of inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at 5–7%.
According to her, this may require a higher key interest rate trajectory than was expected in October.
In the updated forecast by the Central Bank for this and the next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been increased by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum in 2023 and 6.5-7.5% per annum in 2024.
This does not exclude the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have decreased.
And conversely, the likelihood has increased that some further rate increase may be needed in 2024 to bring inflation close to the target of 4%," concluded the head of the Bank of Russia.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end specialized investment funds (SIF) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such papers will be removed from the composition of active retail mutual funds.
This will allow the launch of the management of the remaining liquid assets and the resumption of operations with investment shares.
If more than 10% of the securities in a retail mutual fund are blocked, the management company must segregate them into a separate closed mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will receive shares in the new fund in the same amount as their shares in the main fund.
There is also the option of changing the status of the retail fund to closed.
For funds with a share of blocked securities less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
However, the management company is entitled to allocate blocked assets into a separate closed-end mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of unblocking blocked securities in a specialized PIF.
In the future, if such securities are sold, management companies are obliged to pay investment fund shareholders at least 90% of the proceeds on a quarterly basis, according to a statement by the Bank of Russia.
In addition to summarizing the industry, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to data from Promsvyazbank's Center for Analysis and Expertise, in 2022, passenger traffic in the air transport sector in Russia decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation decreased by 14.2%.
The number of passenger transported was 95.2 million, and the passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger transport amounted to 17.2 million people, which was 26.7% lower than the previous year's level, while domestic transport amounted to 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
Analysts at PSB note that the industry's relative stability was influenced by government support programs.
In 2022, there was a domestic tourism stimulation program, which was allocated 38.8 billion rubles.
Tourists could receive partial refunds for tours with flights arranged by Rosturizm.
In order to ensure the accessibility of air transportation, several state support programs were implemented, including subsidizing passenger transportation, developing regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to additionally allocate 100 billion rubles to airlines and to capitalize "Aeroflot" by 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation sector, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international routes, as well as the continuation of state subsidies (so far, 25.3 billion rubles have been allocated), passenger traffic is expected to increase by 6.4% in 2023, to 101.2 million people (internal passenger traffic will amount to 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviation, to 103.0 million people," analysts at PSB share their forecasts.
Terror attack in Jerusalem, a 6-year-old child killed
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, became victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Six more people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot on the spot.
Later it turned out that it was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
His actions were classified by law enforcement as a terrorist attack, the terrorist's relatives were arrested, and the house was sealed off.
At the same time, according to reports from Israeli media, the attacker had mental problems, and he was only discharged from the hospital this week.
Austria is once again tightening border controls with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say that many people remain at the border in cars waiting to cross into Austria on the other side.
Thus, this becomes a signal to Austrian authorities that they have already gone through the procedure of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
According to existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was made.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those wishing to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and end up between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, enhanced control is necessary.
The decision to tighten checks by Vienna followed a pledge by leaders of the European Union to allocate more funds for cameras, drones, and watchtowers to guard the community's borders.
According to Frontex data, the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status last year for the first time exceeded the 2016 figures and amounted to more than 330 thousand.
The cargo ship Progress 83 successfully docked with the ISS
The Progress 83 cargo ship successfully docked to the International Space Station on Saturday at 3:45 GMT, completing a two-day orbital flight, marking the end of its resupply mission.
The rendezvous took place at an altitude of 269 nautical miles above the southern part of the Pacific Ocean.
The NASA Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, broadcasted the docking.
In Russia, the landing was controlled by specialists from the Flight Control Center.
From the ISS, the cargo ship was welcomed by cosmonauts Sergei Prokopiev, Dmitry Petelin, and Anna Kikina.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of fuel for refueling, 420 kg of water, and approximately 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
"Progress 83" successfully launched from the Russian "Baikonur" cosmodrome on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Roscosmos reported a leak in the Progress MS-21, which was prepared for undocking from the ISS and subsequent sinking on February 18.
According to the company's press service, the transition hatch of the ship was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" was isolated from the overall volume of the ISS.
The causes of its leakage are being investigated."
The TsUP also reported that the ISS crew is not in any danger: "The temperature regime and pressure on board the station are normal."
The crew's lives and health are not in danger, and they feel fine."
"There has been an increase in cases of birth tourism."
How pregnant Russian women got stuck in Argentina
The Argentine migration service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits of Russians who obtained them through the birth of a child but did not remain in the country.
Earlier, the republic's authorities refused entry to the country to several pregnant Russian women who were suspected of arriving for the purposes of "birth tourism."
On February 11, they were finally allowed into Argentina, by court order.
For more details, see the "Gazeta.Ru" article.
The Argentine migration service has begun to suspend and cancel the validity of residence permits (RVPs) granted to Russians through the birth of a child, but who did not remain in the country.
This was reported by C5N TV channel director Florencia Carignano.
"What we do is suspend the residence permit of Russian citizens who came to obtain a residence permit because their child is Argentinian, but who have spent more time outside (Argentina) than within (the country)," she explained.
According to her, when the issue of Argentine citizenship for the Russian will be considered in court, the migration service will provide data indicating that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never returned."
Carignano warned that the residence permits of Russians who received them after the birth of a child and then left may be revoked.
On this background, on February 9 it became known that three pregnant Russian women "got stuck" at the airport in Argentina due to being denied entry into the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, George Polina, the diplomatic mission attributes the incident to the fact that the authorities of the republic may have considered the information provided by the girls at the time of entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and two more arrived in the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women flew to Argentina, but these three were specifically issued a ban from entering the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the Migration Act, where one of the grounds for denying entry into the country is providing incomplete, false, or distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentine migration service, at the court's request, allowed pregnant Russian citizens to enter the country, attorney Christian Rubilar reported.
"An hour ago, they all got permission to enter Argentina," TASS quotes him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows for short-term visa-free travel to 171 countries, including those in the EU, the UK, and Japan, notes RBC.
In early January 2023, The Guardian newspaper wrote about a "boom in birth tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, in 2022, between 2,000 and 2,500 Russian citizens moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who are planning to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number could grow to 10,000," he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that in 2022, around 10,5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in the last months, more than 5,8 thousand pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how prices for renting housing in St. Petersburg had changed.
It has dropped by 10%.
Meanwhile, it is known that rental prices have increased by 25% across the country, reports Patrol Peterburg, citing RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-bedroom apartment cost 25,000 rubles per month, a studio apartment cost 22,000 rubles per month, and a two-bedroom apartment cost 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have traveled abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country have been revealed.
The Argentine migration service did not allow six pregnant Russian women into the country because the purpose of their visit, which they stated, turned out to be false.
This is reported by TASS, citing the Todo Noticias TV channel.
For five hours pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of their visit.
Most of them admitted that they came to a foreign country to give birth.
As a result, the country's representatives did not allow the Russian women to enter Argentina.
According to the publication, the migration service has a procedure in place in the event of suspicions of "false" travellers.
For example, if it is obvious that a woman is in the 33rd week of pregnancy, she has no return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly explain where she is going on vacation, then the migration service immediately suspects her.
Moreover, experts clarify that it is difficult to be a traveller "under such conditions".
The artist's decision to leave the theater was planned.
State Prize of the Russian Federation laureate Alexander Filippenkov stated that the decision by the Mossovet Theater not to renew his contract was planned, and that everything had been agreed in advance with the management.
He spoke about this in an interview with the Interfax news agency.
In the productions he was involved in, he invited performers from the second cast.
The People's Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that his contract expired already in 2022.
All the details had long been agreed with representatives of the theater.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not going to renew the contract.
Filippenkov noted that management was accommodating and prepared all the necessary documents.
He assures us that "he didn't let anyone down."
In addition, it has been revealed that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filippenkov plans to undergo "long-term treatment" in a foreign country.
According to the publication, at present, the film actor is working as a guest actor at the Moscow theater.
According to the publication, the artist performed in the Moscow City Council in such plays as "Shakespeargamlet" and "Hamlet", "Uncle Vanya", and "Three Sisters".
On Friday, February 10, 340,000 cubic meters of snow were removed from private sector territories in Kaliningrad Oblast.
This information was shared by the city administration.
At present, there are more than four hundred private sector streets in Kalininsky District that need to be cleared of snow by spring.
The roads will be cleaned in two stages.
The first will end on February 15, and the second will take place from March 1 to April 15.
114 specialized vehicles and 123 workers will take part in the cleanup.
Authorities reported that contractors are encountering snow removal on the roadway by residents of the houses.
Kirkorov won a court case against the fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man claimed the artist's construction was illegal, but did not appear at the hearing.
The fisherman sued the singer Philip Kirkorov from Moscow Oblast over an allegedly illegal jetty allegedly installed on his dacha.
This is reported by Channel 5.
However, the Saratov fisherman was unable to win the case.
The Oдинцовский городской суд considered a complaint against the singer. According to the lawyer, documents, design projects were presented in court, which confirmed the legality of all structures installed on the territory of the celebrity's home.
As Alexander Dobrovinsky, head of the law firm, clarifies, the construction of the pier did not leave the plaintiff with any chance to go fishing.
The application for the performer was submitted on January 11.
The star lawyer jokingly said that the man probably planned to fish exclusively from the artist's home.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he will ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He emphasized that from that spot, it is possible to cast the spinning rod further.
A sleep specialist has identified the causes of sleep problems
Sleep specialist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about food and habits that interfere with a healthy sleep.
As the expert noted, sleep problems often arise from products containing caffeine.
This primarily refers to tea, coffee, chocolate, and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their consumption before bedtime should be limited, as they not only interfere with sleep, but also make sleep "fragmented," meaning it does not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop consuming caffeine-containing products at least 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to a decrease in the threshold of excitability of the nervous system, and as a result, sleep difficulties arise.
Alcohol negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small amounts of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, quantities exceeding 36 grams per conversion to pure alcohol lead to various sleep disturbances such as shallow sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings.
In addition, to prevent sleep problems, a sleep specialist recommends avoiding sharp foods in large portions.
Large volumes and spicy foods contribute to an increase in the body's internal temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For a healthy sleep, not only the external temperature regime needs to be observed: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees Celsius - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, it is not advisable to overeat heavy foods before bedtime, as this will prevent the body from fully recovering and resting: it will have to expend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and normal activities, so it is extremely important to stick to a sleep and rest schedule and allow the body to recover.
Bloomberg named Trump's rival in the upcoming presidential elections: In the World: Politics: INFOX.ru
According to the agency, the former president's main competitor in the upcoming elections will be Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
Republican DeSantis has not yet officially announced his intention to run for the presidency, but sources at Bloomberg report that he is already preparing for the primaries.
According to the agency, Desantis's team is already selecting advisors to participate in the presidential election and is conducting preliminary polls.
Bloomberg reports that a planned end-of-February field trip for Republican Party leaders and government officials is a sign of this.
The agency reports that the governor of Florida's team is seeking support from Republican colleagues from Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and other states. Experts at Bloomberg have called DeSantis the main potential competitor to Donald Trump.
Experts consider the current governor of Florida to be well-known enough that he does not need to start his election campaign right away, and also note his ability to raise funds.
Ron DeSantis supported Donald Trump's candidacy for the presidency in 2017, and he may run against him in the presidential election scheduled for November 2024.
Donald Trump officially announced his intention to run for the post of president "to make America great again"... during a speech to his supporters in Florida.
Current President Joe Biden, despite the assurances of his team about their intention to participate in the 60th presidential election, stated that there is no firm decision on the matter.
In France, on Saturday, hundreds of demonstrations will be held against the pension reform
The fourth day of mass protests against the pension reform is being held by French unions on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, according to French media.
After a slight decrease in the number of participants in protest actions on the previous Tuesday compared to the first two "days of mobilization," trade unions are hoping to get more people out on the streets this time, taking into account those citizens who were unable to participate in the demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies expect between 600,000 and 800,000 demonstrators across the country, including between 90,000 and 120,000 in Paris, according to the media.
On February 7, according to the French Ministry of the Interior, 757,000 people took part in protests against the pension reform.
The largest union federation, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), reported 2 million demonstrators.
According to the VKT, on Tuesday, 400,000 demonstrators took to the streets of Paris.
The police claim there were 57,000 of them.
On the previous day of protests on January 31, the number of demonstrators was estimated by the police to be 1.27 million people, and by trade unions to be 2.8 million.
The next mass protest actions are scheduled for February 16.
It was reported on January 10 that French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne presented the government-developed pension reform project, which envisages increasing the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
It is assumed that the age threshold for retirement will gradually shift from 62 to 64 over the course of three months per year, and this process will continue until 2030.
The new regime will apply to French generations born in September 1961 or later.
French President Emmanuel Macron pledged during the 2022 election campaign to push through a pension reform by the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, the French National Assembly began considering the government's pension reform project.

More than 180 traffic accidents occurred in Astana within 24 hours: February 11, 2023, 14:10
ASTANA.KAZINFORM - The capital city police department urges drivers to be extremely careful on the roads, taking into account the impact of weather conditions, reduced visibility during precipitation, and changes in road traction in icy conditions.
Over the past 24 hours, 181 traffic accidents have been registered.
This is reported by MIA "Kazinform" with reference to the press service of the Astana city police department.
Pedestrians should also be careful on the road, as violations of their crossing rules can also lead to serious consequences.
This year, there were 11 cases of collisions with pedestrians who crossed the roadway in violation of established requirements, all 11 pedestrians sustained bodily injuries.
So far this year, a total of 35 traffic accidents have been registered, in which 3 people died and 39 people sustained bodily injuries of varying degrees of severity.
In order to prevent road traffic injuries, Moscow police have prevented more than 16,000 violations of traffic rules since the beginning of the year, detained 213 drunk drivers, and fined more than 1,600 pedestrian offenders.

The Progress MS-21 leak occurred on the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos reported a leak in the "Progress MS-21" spacecraft, which was prepared for undocking from the ISS, according to MIA "Kazinform", citing TASS.
"The hull of the Progress MS-21 transport cargo ship has been depressurized, as confirmed by telemetry data received at the Flight Control Center," the Roscosmos press service reported. The sinking of the ship is scheduled for February 18.
It is noted that at present, it is isolated from the general volume of the station.
The cause of the incident is being investigated, and it did not affect the docking of the cargo ship Progress MS-22, nor the further course of the ISS mission.
The situation was commented on by Roscosmos Executive Director for manned space programs, Sergei Krikalev.
On a cargo ship that has been docked at the station for several months, a leak occurred in the thermal regulation system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to us with the ship ("Soyuz MS-22" - TASS note) in the middle of December," he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with "Soyuz" concluded that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure that there are no problems with subsequent launches.
We need to conduct a thorough analysis to ensure that this cause does not apply to similar constructions on future launches.
This is the main task that will now stand before us," he said.
According to the executive director, an analysis will be conducted from the perspective of the ship's readiness for launch, the materials used, and the technologies employed in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was carried out in the case of the damaged radiator on the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
"The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some systematic error," Krikalev added.
The CEO clarified that on Saturday, the commission began its work, which will conduct an analysis of all possible causes.
"The ship was scheduled to be detached and deorbited two days before the launch of the "Soyuz" ("Soyuz MS-23" - TASS note) spacecraft, so the impact on the crew's actions, the crew's work... and the program from this perspective will not be significant," Krikalev noted.
The Progress MS-21 cargo vehicle was launched from Baikonur on the Soyuz-2.1a launch vehicle on October 26.
Two days later, it docked with the small research module "Quest" of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The ship delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA named the location of the Progress leak "leak"
The cargo ship Progress MS-21's leakage on the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal control system.
This was announced by a representative of the US Flight Control Center (FCC) during a conversation with the ISS crew, which was broadcast by NASA.
According to NASA, the leak of coolant from Progress has now stopped.
NASA believes that all the refrigerant is completely gone.
"This morning we had a leak of refrigerant from the thermal regulation system into space, and the leak was stopped," said the representative of the American MCC (quote from Interfax).
Earlier, the Progress circuit was isolated due to a leak.
Roscosmos reported that the astronauts are not in any danger.
The Progress MS-22 docked with the ISS today, February 11. It will be deorbited, according to the plan, on February 18.
John Kirby, the Strategic Communications Coordinator at the US National Security Council, refused to announce a possible trip by US President Joe Biden to Ukraine.
He told journalists about this at a briefing, which was broadcast on the White House's YouTube channel.
Kirby noted that he "has nothing to announce about additional points of the American leader's trip to Poland."
The day before, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Biden's visit to Poland from February 20 to 22.
According to a White House official, during the trip the US president will discuss with Polish leadership bilateral cooperation, as well as collective efforts to support Ukraine and strengthen NATO capabilities in the area of deterrence.
Prior to this, Kirby said that Biden would visit Ukraine when the time was right, but now is not the time for official visits.
A fitness expert spoke about outdoor winter workouts for weight loss
A fitness expert called winter walks a great way to lose weight without intense exercise
Fitness expert Anthony Eng explained an effective outdoor interval workout for weight loss.
His words are quoted by the Eat This, Not That portal.
The expert called active winter walks an excellent way to lose weight without intense exercise, as well as to improve cardiovascular and psychological health.
For the first five to ten minutes, walk at a normal pace to warm up your body and joints.
Then walk as fast as you can for one minute, without running.
One minute - at a normal pace," explains Yeng.
Three sets are required.
Next, the specialist advises to perform squat jumps or squats with weights for 15 seconds, followed by walking at a comfortable pace for another 45 seconds.
This sequence should be repeated five times. Then, Eng suggests alternating an active step (two minutes) with a relaxed one (one minute) three more times.
The walk should be concluded with a five-minute walk at a leisurely pace and a few stretches.
In total, this outdoor training session will require 35 minutes of fresh air.
Previously, master of athletics Maxim Babenkov-Kudryavtsev gave advice to Lenta.ru on choosing winter running gear.
You will need thermal underwear, moisture-wicking clothing, special light but warm headgear.
Winter running shoes differ in having more dense materials, a higher platform, and a more aggressive sole," the athlete explained.
On February 17, a creative evening with a Russian Orthodox writer, historian, screenwriter, and member of the Russian Union of Writers will be held at the Central House of Artists.
Writers, screenwriters, and scientists will participate in the evening.
Also in the program: Zlatan Alexander (piano) - a laureate of all-Russian and international competitions, Dmitry Akinfin (violin) - a laureate of international competitions, a member of Vladimir Spivakov's orchestra, the Choir of the Holy Trinity Sergius Lavra and the Moscow Theological Academy (MTA) - regent Father Nestor, and the Choir Group.

The head of Serpukhov inspected the condition of MKDs
Head of Serpukhov District Sergey Nikitenko made a working tour of the territories.
Together with representatives of the management companies, he inspected the contents of multi-apartment and residential buildings.
The addresses with the highest number of complaints from residents turned out to be under the strictest supervision.
- Many of the complaints are well-founded and relate primarily to cleaning the stairwells and maintaining common areas.
The Serpukhov residents themselves are not staying on the sidelines and are actively fighting the problem of vandalism, especially the widespread graffiti.
We will work on this issue taking into account the "Safe Region" cameras, said the head of the municipality, Sergey Nikitenko.
Attention was also drawn to the replacement of mailboxes, light bulbs, the installation of wires in conduits, and the late removal of waste from container sites.
In the shortest possible time, property management companies must solve all the tasks set before them.
The deputy head of RZhD suggested to the governor of Irkutsk Oblast to explore new sales channels
Irkutsk Region needs to continue to explore alternative sales channels, other than the Far East.
This includes both the domestic market and the ports of the Western Direction, including the Azovo-Chernomorsky Basin.
Deputy General Director of RZhD Alexei Shilo made such a proposal at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, according to a report from the regional government on February 10, 2023.
As last year's experience showed, even despite the geographical location of Irkutsk Oblast, this decision can be extremely effective.
It is important that logistics services companies constantly interact with our "neighbors" (ports, operators, and maritime transportation) and find optimal pricing conditions for transporting their products under new schemes, - Alexey Shilo emphasized.
The governor noted the importance of stable product delivery, as Irkutsk Oblast is one of the richest regions in mineral resources in Russia and has significant reserves of brown and hard coal.
Approximately 25 enterprises engage in coal mining in the region.
The instability of export product deliveries negatively affects the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also emphasized that Irkutsk Oblast is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metal products produced in the region to a level that ensures stable operation of such enterprises.
Recognizing the importance of Irkutsk Oblast as an industrial center, we, on our part, will do our best to provide support in terms of transport volumes.
If there is additional volume of deliveries to the domestic market, we are also ready to provide assistance in this direction, said Alexei Shilo.
Konstantin Zaitsev met with the activists of the villages Granovshchina and Khomutovo
At the request of the head of the region Igor Kobzev, the Chairman of the Irkutsk Region Government, Konstantin Zaitsev, worked in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo today.
In the village of Granovshchyna, the Prime Minister familiarized himself with the work of the new educational institution - Granovska School, which opened in September 2022.
The facility was built as part of the "Modern School" federal project under the "Education" national project.
Eight school blocks contain: classrooms, a dining hall, a kitchen, an auditorium, two gyms, club rooms, a library, administrative facilities, toilets, common recreation areas, and a medical block.
240.8 million rubles were allocated from the federal budget for construction, more than 512 million rubles from regional funds, and more than 72 million rubles from the municipal budget.
In addition, a regional subsidy was allocated for the purchase of equipment in the amount of 64.2 million rubles.
After the school opened, in addition to children from Granovschina village, students from the Urikovskaya school, which was undergoing a major renovation, also attended.
More than 100 teachers conduct classes, of whom almost 90 are subject teachers.
In 2022, the school was allocated a bus purchased by the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade under a federal program.
In 2022, work began on the major renovation of Khomutovskaya Secondary School No. 2, a general education school.
Students in the primary grades were assigned to Homutovskaya School No. 1, while the older grades attend classes in the second building of School No. 2.
According to the repair plan, the roof will be replaced, the engineering systems, windows, and associated elements will be replaced, the facade will be repaired, and the interior of the rooms will be renovated.
An important component of the capital repair is recreating the thermal point with water heating, instead of the dry heat that was used previously.
The cost of all the work is more than 80 million rubles.
Repairs are in the final stages, there are problems with connecting to the power grid - more power is needed, work is being done with the power supplier.
In Granovshchina and Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev also met with citizens, some of whom had illegally connected houses to the electricity grid, which were sold to developers.
It was decided that the network company will organize a personal reception next week to address these legal issues.
- Very often, the issue of stable electricity supply is the main condition for buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electricity for heating purposes.
Therefore, sellers sometimes illegally connect homes to nearby networks, which is grounds for disconnecting the power supply.
Therefore, now, network companies in areas where active construction is underway must pay special attention to this issue, Konstantin Zaitsev emphasized.
Anatoly Prokopyev assessed the effectiveness of state support measures for UOBO peasant and farmer households
The head of the UOBO, Anatoly Prokopyev, visited three KFHs today in the Ekhirit-Bulagatsky District.
The head of the KFH in the village of Kapsal, Julia Madaeva, received a grant to develop her farm as a beginning farmer in 2014.
One of the main areas of activity of the enterprise is the production of livestock products.
The cattle population increases every year, and the gross production of meat and milk increases as well.
Later, thanks to the support of the state, there was an opportunity in 2019 to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family dairy cattle farm.
At present, the herd consists of around 150 head of cattle, 60 of which are cows.
In addition, they are engaged in the cultivation of cereal crops and sowing of annual forage crops here.
Thanks to the efforts of Viktor Katanayev's KFH, the area of Kharyshino in the village of Kulunkukun has been classified as a settlement.
The farm is engaged in the breeding and fattening of dairy cattle.
In 2014, a grant was received for the development of a family dairy cattle farm with 60 head.
As of today, the herd consists of 150 head of cattle.
For many years, they have also been engaged in potato cultivation here.
The head of the KFH tries to create all the necessary conditions for work and living for the collective.
There is now a whole village on the estate grounds.
Anatoly Prokopyev took the issue of the construction of two km of road from Kharyshino to Ust-Ordynsky under his personal control.
The main activities of the KFH Stalina Mogzoeva in the village of Otonhoi are cattle and buffalo breeding.
In 2020, the farm participated in a competitive selection process and received the "AGROSTARTUP" grant for the development of a livestock-oriented farm.
With these funds, a tractor trailer, two press-packers, and a mower were purchased.
The head of the household increases the livestock population every year and increases the gross production of meat.
In addition, the KFH sows annual forage crops on an area of 40 ha.
Stalin planned to open a fattening area for Mogzova.
After visiting three farms, the head of the district noted that state support measures are effective, necessary, and needed.
The Irkutsk region government pays a lot of attention to agriculture.
Therefore, state support should not only be maintained, but increased and improved.
We, in turn, must be a guarantor of food security.
The agricultural producers in the district fulfill this role with honor, emphasized Anatoly Prokopyev.
The crossing on the Armenian-Turkish border has been opened for the first time in decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid
For the first time in three decades, the Margara-Alijan border crossing between Turkey and Armenia was opened to deliver humanitarian aid to victims of the earthquake.
This is reported by Turkish and Armenian media.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, notes the Turkish agency Anadolu.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicines, water, and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adıyaman in southern Turkey, said Serdar Kılıç, Turkey's special envoy for Armenian-Turkish talks.
He thanked the Vice Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Ruben Rubinyan and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help provided by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-affected region," Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
Armenia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Vaan Unanyan, in turn, reported that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the Margar bridge and are heading to the earthquake-affected region.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the car last crossed the Margara Bridge 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish agency Anadolu provides other data and writes that the Margara-Alijan border crossing was last used for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Armenia to deal with the aftermath of the devastating 1988 earthquake.
Then, aid was sent to the disaster zone in Armenia via the Turkish Red Crescent.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to the earthquake-affected areas.
According to the latest reports, more than 25,000 people have died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
On February 11, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan reported that the number of dead in Turkey already known is 21,848.
On the Syrian side, 3,553 deaths were reported.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are marred mainly by the fact that Ankara refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
In recent times, Yerevan and Ankara have made several attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special envoys who met several times in Vienna to discuss the normalization issue.
In February 2022, commercial air traffic between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year hiatus.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening a land border for citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

Russian mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter Islam Makhachev received a prestigious award from the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), becoming the recipient of the "Submission of the Year" award for his early victory over Brazilian Charles Oliveira in a match.
"Submission of the Year".
When I caught Oliveira and locked him in, I thought he would give up.
I knew my skills and told the journalists and everyone around me that I was going to strangle Charles.
And I defeated the most dangerous fighter in the grappling arena.
I know that I deserve this award.
Thank you," the fighter is quoted as saying by the UFC press service.
The vacant UFC lightweight championship bout between Makhachev and Oliveira, which took place in October 2022 at the Abu Dhabi tournament, ended with a victory for the 31-year-old Russian by choke hold in the second round.

Crespo named the strong points of Enzo Fernandez, who joined Chelsea for 121 million euros
Former Argentine national team player Hernan Crespo commented on the transfer of Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernandez to London's Chelsea.
In particular, he stated that he was impressed by the player's performance at the last World Cup.
According to him, the 22-year-old midfielder will be a great addition to the "blues" as he can play in different positions.
Fernandes is like Makelele plus Lampard.
If you need him to play in the position of Makelele, he can do it very well.
This guy also has a good goal sense, a good shot from outside the penalty area, so if you need him to play as a striker like Lampard or Essien, he can do it," Crespo said to British media.
As a reminder, Enzo Fernandez joined Chelsea for 121 million euros.
At the 2022 World Cup, he played 7 matches, scored 1 goal, and made 1 assist.

Match forecast for the Club World Cup match Real - Al-Hilal on February 11, 2023
On February 11, the final of the Club World Cup football tournament will be held at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in the Moroccan city of Rabat.
In the match for the trophy, Real Madrid will face Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia.
The game will start at 22:00 Moscow time, and the live broadcast will begin at 21:55 MSK on the matchtv.ru website and the "Match! Football 2" channel.
Analysts at the Betcity betting company consider "blancos" to be huge favorites: you can bet on Real winning in regular time with a coefficient of 1.28, with a probability of about 77%.
The nominal guests' success is available at 11.0 (8%).
Even a draw is offered at a significantly lower quote of 6.10 (15%).
Do you believe that teams won't find the strongest in 90 minutes?
A bet of 1,000 rubles on a "peaceful" outcome if you win will bring 6,100 rubles.
You can bet on Madrid's triumph taking into account extra time and a series of penalties for 1.14. This market is available at 5.80 at Al Hilal.
The Saudi Arabian team is on its way to the final, having overcome two rounds, defeating the Moroccan "Wydad" in a penalty shootout and the Brazilian "Flamenco" in regular time (3:2).
You can bet that the underdog will at least not lose to the Europeans in 90 minutes for 3.90.
Analysts are expecting a lot of goals: the total over 2.5 goals is available at 1.53, and the TM 2.5 is available at 2.60.
Blancos clearly outclass their opponent, whose squad, according to Transfermarkt, a statistical website, is valued at a mere 39.6 million euros.
For comparison, Real's roster is valued at 849 million euros.
In addition, to the horror of Al-Hilal, the Madrid team's main striker and current holder of the Golden Ball, Karim Benzema, will recover in time for the final.
But even without the Frenchman, Real is performing well at this tournament: they defeated the Egyptian Al-Ahly team 4:1 in the semi-finals.
The Arabs' matches were also quite exciting: in the quarterfinals they tied 1-1 and won in the penalty shootout, and in the semifinals they won dramatically 3-2.
Recommended bet: Real win and over 2.5 goals at 1.76.
Guberniev commented on the fact that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
Famous TV commentator Dmitry Guberniev commented on midfielder Pavel Mamaev's decision to end his playing career.
Now, it will be possible to cast a bust in the hero's homeland.
He made a big mistake and for most people he will remain in people's memories not as a footballer, but as a footballer who committed a crime.
But he still has a long way to go to match Kokorin.
Because no one has managed to waste their potential as much as Kokorin did.
Maimaiov, despite his many talents, was occasionally visible.
I can only wish him good luck and find a place to realize himself somewhere else," quotes Guberniev Metaratings.ru.
The last club of the 34-year-old midfielder was Khimki.
The Moscow region club did not renew the contract of the midfielder in the summer of 2022.
Previously Mamayev played for Torpedo, CSKA, Krasnodar, and Rostov.
Mamayev is a champion of Russia, a three-time winner of the Russian Cup, and a two-time winner of the Russian Super Cup with CSKA.

But the desire to paint and a special view of the world prompted her to pick up a brush.
The exhibition features numerous landscapes by the artist, full of extraordinary light.
It seems as though they glow from within.
The nature of the Far East, Vologda, and, of course, Bashkiria, which has become the author's second home, inspires N. Alekseev to create beautiful paintings.
The author's numerous fans, friends, relatives, and former colleagues from the factory gathered to congratulate her on the opening of the exhibition.
The exhibition will run until March 9.

Maxim Reshetnikov noted that tourism in Bashkortostan is developing at a good pace.
"Bashkir longevity" is a great project, and the creation of a well-developed infrastructure plays a big role.
The republic's experience in this area can be taken as a model.
The Minister of Economic Development of Russia and the Head of the Republic became guests of the "Winter Sabantuy," which is taking place at the foot of the mountain, and observed archery and "Audarysh" horse racing.
On the festival site, there is a market of handicrafts and farm produce, and performances by national artistic groups.

In 2023, 20 million rubles will be allocated to support apiary beekeeping in the region.
The funds will be allocated within the framework of the relevant republican program.
They can be used to purchase breeding bee families, hives and equipment, as well as laboratory studies of honey and the genetic authenticity of bee breeds.

Tyumen inspectors identified 19 drivers who were operating a vehicle while intoxicated with alcohol.
All of them were arrested and removed from the road overnight.
This is reported by the Tumen Region Traffic Police.
Violators were detected during a comprehensive inspection in the village of Golysmanovo and in the area of the 9th kilometer of the Tumen-Borovsky-Bogandinsky highway.

A tanker carrying diesel from a previously Russian-flagged vessel was not allowed into a Spanish port
The Tarragona Naval Command of the Main Fleet of the Spanish Ministry of Transport has banned the Maersk Magellan ship from entering the city's port to unload diesel fuel, as the cargo comes from the Nobel ship, which until July 1, 2022 sailed under the Russian flag, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
The Tarragona Naval Command of the Main Fleet of the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has prohibited the ship Maersk Magellan, flying the flag of Singapore, from entering the port of Tarragona for the purpose of unloading diesel fuel, as the cargo it carries originates from the ship Nobel, flying the Cameroonian flag, which until 1 July 2022 sailed under the Russian flag, the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was adopted in accordance with EU legislation, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag since April 16, 2022, or that has changed its flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was carried out on February 9, after which the ban was agreed upon.
The ministry reminded that this is not the first time that ships have been prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, access was denied to the Black Star ship under the Maltese flag in the port of Barcelona, which was carrying a cargo from a ship under the Russian flag.
In 2022, after the EU strengthened anti-Russian sanctions, the US and the UK introduced restrictions on the supply of Russian oil products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.
From December 5, 2022, the price cap on sea oil deliveries from Russia introduced by unfriendly countries is in effect.
Then, a cap was set on Russian oil at the level of $60/barrel.
Also, from December 5, the EU embargo on sea-based oil imports from Russia is in effect.
The problems encountered by pregnant Russian women entering Argentina have been explained
According to an expert, in the wake of an influx of people wanting to give birth in Argentina, the country's authorities have become more vigilant about monitoring the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
The difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are related to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a mass influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
This is reported by Lenta.ru, citing Professor Victor Heifetz of St. Petersburg State University, the editor-in-chief of the journal Latin America, who said the following:
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that in Argentina, there is no support for turning the country into a transit point, rather than a final destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision on whether to issue Argentine passports to the parents after obtaining a residence permit will be made by the court.
If it turns out that they actually did not live in Argentina and left immediately, they may be denied citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, the expert noted that birth tours to Argentina are particularly popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
As a reminder, Argentina grants citizenship based on the "right of the soil," that is, if a person is born on its territory.
An Argentine passport opens the possibility of visa-free travel to 170 countries, including those of the EU and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began revoking the residence permits of Russians who received the document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It has also been reported that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the purpose of their trip.
In Russia, they predict the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs
In Russia, interest among citizens in fitness services is being restored, which allows market participants to expand their businesses.
In the current year, the country may open more than 400 new facilities, mostly small-format ones.
In Russia, about 400 new fitness clubs may open, and the total number may increase by 5%.
According to Kommersant, at the same time, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, Russia will have around 8,6 thousand clubs.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-format projects with low initial investments and quick payback.
Such data are provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
Olga Kiselova, president of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, noted in a conversation with the publication that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, while the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NFS President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, the number of club closures has exceeded the number of openings every year.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
Meanwhile, independent analysts provide different figures.
According to "Kontur.Focus", over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main type of activity "fitness center work" has increased by 10.1%, and now there are 5,120 of them.
The industry suffered significant losses due to the pandemic, but it began to recover as early as 2021.
According to 2GIS, there are 4,500 fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over one million.
Russians have started paying more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in visits to fitness clubs.
By the end of January 2023, the number of visitors increased by 9.3% year-on-year.
According to Silina, if the trend can be maintained, the industry will return to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year.
The license of a management company from Kirow was revoked
The arbitration court of the Kirov region annulled the license granted to the management company "Zabota" to engage in entrepreneurial activity in the management of multi-apartment buildings.
In Kirov Region, the regional Arbitration Court has annulled the license previously granted to the management company "Zabota" to engage in business activities related to the management of multi-apartment buildings.
According to the regional State Inspectorate of Housing and Communal Services, the court decision was made as early as November 2022, but only came into force in February 2023.
The arbitration court revoked the "management company's" license for failing to comply with multiple orders from the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently, all objects that were under the management of "Care" have been excluded from the register of licenses for the conduct of business activities related to the management of multi-apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64,800 square meters.
All the houses are located in the regional center.
The administration of Kirov is aware that they are without a management company.
In accordance with Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor about the situation that had arisen.
As a reminder, in January 2023, Governor of Kirov Region Alexander Sokolov tasked the staff of the State Housing Inspectorate with liquidating 2/3 of the region's management companies by spring, as there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands raised doubts among Kirov's communists.
They turned to the regional prosecutor's office and requested that Sokolov be held administratively liable.
It is presumed that the Federal Antimonopoly Service could have taken the same position.
The antimonopoly officials allegedly also asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the regional leader.

The company, commenting on the situation, stated that payments to customers are made with their consent, and that there can be no leakage of bank card data.

Opening hours are from 10:00 to 22:00.
In the store, you can have a coffee and a snack of freshly baked goods.
There is a small parking lot from the shopping center.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, a wide selection of syrups and alternative milks.
Delicious fresh baked goods😍😍😍.
Satisfying sandwiches.
A convenient cafeteria area
We came with my daughter to arrange my pension.
They welcomed us warmly, explained everything clearly, scanned the documents, processed the application, and told us how to schedule subsequent appointments.
Upon entering, the administrator and security staff greet you culturally and respectfully.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, but it wouldn't hurt to buy another water cooler.
We came twice and everything was great!
I wish all workers peace, good fortune, success, and a decent salary in this difficult time for everyone!
It's just a wonderful place!
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a mug of glühwein and waiting for the oyster salad (which is simply divine!),
I strongly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
The sweet cashier lady asked me if I wanted a coffee with me or in the hall, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked for 300 ml in the room.
A few minutes later, I am given a plastic cup.
I wanted to be in ceramics, so I'm "in the hall."
They did it to me.
I ask why it's in a cup, not a mug.
The girl replies that they don't have cups with a volume of 300 ml.
How does this fit in a person's head?
Ask yourself or in the room, i.e. determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or into a disposable cup.
Get an answer - in the hall, i.e. in the cup.
Specify the volume.
To hear that 300 ml.
Make a person face the fact that there are no cups of that size.
Here, they say, is a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is notable that this is the third such case in Green Oko on my memory.
It is doubly remarkable that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink my coffee the way I wanted. I asked for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Is the Green Outskirts Cafeteria and the Green Outskirts organization two sides of the same coin or are they unrelated organizations?
If unconnected, understanding emerges.
If they are connected, why has a well-known food and retail business known for its service and quality descended to the rhetoric of a kiosk at Kazan Station?
It's rhetoric because, as I said, this kind of thing has happened to me three times already.
I don't rule out that this is happening to me alone.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she was improvising.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please outline the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to get service.
We really like the circus, we've been going there since our childhood.
I saw numbers with Nikulin Y. himself.
And now, even with children and nephews.
The atmosphere at the circus is nice, and the programs are also.
The locations are very convenient.
From almost any point, the arena is visible and the backs of those sitting in front of you do not obstruct your view.
The circus is very intimate, family-oriented!
This time we went to the New Year's program.
We were a little disappointed.
There are a lot of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with magic tricks and more animals.
It's a shame that we can no longer take photos with animals in the lobby.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
And in general, a very pleasant place!
I wish you success and to delight us with your performances!!!
The developer, Otdelstroy, chooses good locations for building residential complexes, which I like.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before purchasing, we were invited to see the complex when there were no walls yet, so that we could see everything in person, although we looked at many apartments and no other developer offered us this.
Russia's favorite ski resort!
The best thing is the gentle, sparse forests e, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks, in my opinion, are rather boring and short.
The longest on sector e are still somewhat better.
But overall, it's a great atmosphere, with lots of different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing vibe is guaranteed!
Great master Peri!
She did everything as quickly and as well as possible, the salon is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a cloakroom and water available.
Terrible service.
The second time I come to pick up my order at the time indicated in the app, I wait more than 30 minutes at the window for my order.
Today, such a service is unacceptable in business!
The Care Team's response - we're trying.
Even at the checkout, without an apology, just - it's not our fault, it's the program.
You couldn't even call to warn them, and you didn't find any other technical means of communication with your previously loyal customers.
"They try" impotents, but business has to work.
Thank you all, everyone goes their separate ways.
We won't be ordering from you again, and we certainly won't be recommending you.
A bad mood, waiting for guests, apologies from the hostess - these are not the best condiments for hot sushi rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
He expected to receive the car within 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but in fact it took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation at the Lithuanian-Belarusian border (Lithuania was executing).
In the end, I am very happy with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, and Alexander - they are always available, provide up-to-date information, professional consultations, and a normal human approach.
Thank you again!
We booked a house for 4 days for 3 people.
The cabins are clean, cozy, warm (very), and each has its own little kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, and all the necessary dishes.
There is a cleaning agent and sponge available.
Among the drawbacks, one can perhaps mention that the space is really too small, and the shower in the bathroom is really tiny.
There are no designated storage spaces for snowboards or skis, and there's not much space to dry clothes either, so we had to borrow a clothes dryer from the hosts and squeeze it in place of a chair, and put a heater underneath it.
Otherwise, it's a pretty good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is tasty, and the selection of dishes is sufficient to meet the needs of any guest.
The prices are reasonable.
There is wine and beer for those who want to drink.
The center of Moscow, I recommend
A wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come back again.
The property has all the necessary amenities, including parking and a pool table.
Rooms with good repairs and all amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetically pleasing place, we walked there during our visit to Kaliningrad.
I really liked it, and Russia in miniature, and Ozerov Park and the landscape.
In winter, there are many hills that are natural for children to play on).
A very cool tobacco and hookah shop!)
We constantly shop here, the prices are low and the quality is great!
The staff are very responsive and will help and answer any questions you may have.
I highly recommend this store for a visit! ❤️
Location is convenient for everyone.
For me personally, it's normal.
They serve quickly if no one is hanging around.
It's convenient to record.
The staff are attentive, they will guide you, direct you, and consult with you even if you come on non-office days.
In principle, it's fine.
Great guys!
Thank you very much!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, and the prices are reasonable compared to other services.
I thought the button was for dumping, but they turned out to be such smarties and did everything for me.
A huge thank you to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery within 2 hours on March 8th.
They brought flowers in a package after 6 hours, as if they had been stolen (there's barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized something was wrong.
I compared it to the photo on the website and the color turned out to be completely different from the one I ordered.
I decided to count again and it turned out that there were an even number of tulips, 20 in total.
Support in WhatsApp responded to my complaints about the color and number of colors with "apparently they mixed up the color."
The next day I wrote again and they offered to compensate me with 15%.
I think this is the ultimate level of audacity and is probably considered fraud.
I have already filed a complaint with the tax office about the fact that I was refused a receipt.
Next up is Rospoznadzor and the court.
I would not recommend anyone to deal with this organization.
For more than 10 years, I have been going to Samira for hair coloring and haircuts.
I want to cancel the Professionalism of Samira the master, she does her job excellently, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always carefully listens to the client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I boldly recommend this master to all family and friends.
All her work is always done to the highest standard!!!
A huge thank you to Master Samira 😍
I welcome you to this gaming club. I can say that the prices are excellent, there are many gaming computers, and there are also drinks and food.
Among the drawbacks, some keyboards have broken buttons that fly off, and if we take the "normal gameplay process" into account, the computers are not very powerful :(
Therefore, a rating of 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to his group for training, and the mother goes to the fitbox in the evening.
The supervisors are very attentive, and the coaches are professional.
They organize themed celebrations for children, keep the premises clean, and maintain the equipment.
It's nice to walk and exercise.
A 6-year-old child already has a good ability to absorb impact, a strong OFP.
Recommended for children, moms, and dads)
The best masters!
Irina is simply gold!
He performs the work well, is caring, and checks everything.
You can always talk to girls about something!
I was there for the third time!
I will never regret it!
Finally, I can grow my hair after bleaching it! !!!
And Vit also studies color theory.
Therefore, she will soon be able to combine blonde with keratin!
And your hair will thank you 🥰🥰
Master technician Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive technician who explained everything clearly about the scheduled maintenance.
She also provided all kinds of assistance during the repair of my car.
And also thanks to master Valeriy Ushakov for his attentive and professional conduct of the works.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was done well.
The only thing that was confusing when scheduling maintenance was the insufficiently accurate information about the maintenance schedule. When I arrived for maintenance, the schedule was more clearly explained.
I want to express my immense gratitude to the Administration staff.
A very rare custody certificate was required to approve a real estate transaction, and the staff were very friendly and helped to obtain this certificate, even though they could have refused as it was not part of their duties.
Thank you very much!
Here, very warm-hearted people work.
Wonderful, warm, polite staff, I didn't regret coming to this particular hair salon! 👍
Master Nahida did a perfect balayage, haircut, took into account and understood all my requests, and I definitely recommend her to everyone ❤️
I really liked the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
For the 800th anniversary, it has been restored, and the interior is stylish and clean.
There are cafes and toilets for tourists as well.
I went on an excursion too, it was great.
And I definitely recommend the Russian collection of the Nizhny Novgorod art museum - a surprisingly beautiful collection.
I have known Olya for more than 3 years, and we use her services regularly.
Over this time, we have seen Olya develop in her beloved profession, constantly learning new things and expanding the space for four-legged friends, which only evokes admiration and trust.
We always leave our little dog with a peaceful mind.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be collected/delivered by the zoo taxi.
And they will also bring clean and tasty ones)
It's a fairytale 🥰
Thank you for the care and personal attention to our pets 🐕💜
The Hungry Moose restaurant is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They make delicious dishes.
The menu is varied.
It is advisable to book seats in advance, especially on Fridays!
A lovely well-kept zoo.
Less than Moscow's, but just as interesting and convenient.
We were there on weekdays - adult admission was 300 ₽, for a schoolchild it was 170.
There were few people, we enjoyed walking around, and we looked at the animals.
The armadillo impressed me)
In Moscow, by the way, he was not seen.
There are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices on the premises, the toilets are clean and free, and we also saw a charging station for phones.
In general, I recommend it 👍
The salon is top-notch!!!
I am very satisfied with the services of cosmetologist Kuznetsova Natalia, I only go to her.
I do various face treatments, both mechanical and apparatus-based.
I am 100% satisfied.
A master of his craft👍
She explains everything in detail about the skin, and she selected cosmetics that are suitable for my skin type, it's just perfect.
I'm now a happy and beautiful person!
Thank you, Natalia!!!
A great club with a huge space, pool, sauna, hamam, and excellent trainers!
The downside is the huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the changing rooms.
It feels like they come to the club like they're going to a public bathhouse!
A special emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, from 7 p.m. onwards, there are a lot of people!
I give it three stars, but only because of the first visit, when I got to see a consultant, if I'm not mistaken, Timur, but I could be wrong.
He processed everything quickly, told me all the pros and cons, explained everything clearly, and my son also decided to get a card. Unfortunately, the consultants were busy with their own affairs, and the customers were waiting in line. A consultant finally approached my son, who understood everything perfectly, and they chatted several times in the consultation room, apparently having a good time. In the end, my son left without having anything processed, and the consultant said, "Well, if you don't want to, that's fine." I was surprised, as I was present at this meeting.
The new office, in a new format, is all comfortable and such an attitude.
It's a shame that the first impression was spoiled, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers is not dependent on the change of staff.
The selection is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to the formation of pills), the staff knows their range, and they help with the selection of styles.
You can dress both the slender and the child with an atypical figure and height.
They are located close to the metro, and there is even a small parking lot.
Recommended!
He was there in September, celebrating his birthday.
In principle, the service and food quality were all good: the prices are low, the portions are medium-sized, so you can eat your fill, or order again.
The only complaint is reserving a table.
When I ordered, I specified the number and everything else that was required, and then the bot immediately called to check the phone number.
After that, there's nothing else.
When I arrived at the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table had not been reserved.
Fortunately, there were free places and we were able to be accommodated.
Otherwise, it's actually a very good restaurant with an excellent price/quality ratio.
Recommended!
I went for a cleaning recently over the weekend.
I have never seen such an organized staff, who treated my many questions with the utmost care and suggested how and what to do for further treatment of the dental cavity.
I wholeheartedly recommend it, the only clinic I can remember that doesn't want to make money by overcharging.
A good shopping center.
There's everything!
A wide range of products.
Diversity of shops.
There is always something to suit your taste.
From food to gifts.
no way am I going back to that store.
We bought a washing machine, and they said that we live outside the city, so they would deliver it themselves.
The manager in the hall told us where to drive to the warehouse, and when we asked if they would load it, he said yes. ))
they took it out of the box at the warehouse, and when asked why, they said that's how they load everything.
when I insisted, they stuffed two strips of foam insulation, like it doesn't matter!
They refused to load the trailer, saying that it wasn't their job, you load it yourself, they deliver )))
when I said that I would then refuse the order altogether, they said, "Well, do whatever you want, it doesn't matter to us," and in the end, one of them did deign to go down the ramp and help my father to load the car into the trailer.
I have never encountered such rude service before.
The good shopping center Chisto is very tidy. There is a large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a "Kosmik" cinema and an entertainment center for children, "Nevidalia".
On the lower floor, there is a large Hypermarket "Lenta".
Convenient, large parking, convenient location.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear, and household goods.
A diverse range of products, reasonable prices, polite and attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the selection and provide advice.
Everyone will find what they need.
A good place to spend an evening.
The staff is very good, a pleasant establishment.
I recommend that everyone will never make a mistake in their choice. The best establishment in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be superb.
I recommend visiting)
We would like to thank Marina Chasova, who was our agent for organizing the funeral arrangements.
When she came to us on call, she took on the task of resolving all the issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was always available and kept us informed about how things were going.
Thanks to her, we were able to send a loved one off with dignity.
Everything was arranged and clearly organized, as we discussed at our first meeting.
Marina, fully aware of the state of our loved ones, gave advice on how things would be better and simply empathized with us in a human way.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
Swayed by many good reviews, I turned to "RemStirMash" and I was assigned a master, Alexander.
He started the conversation by saying that the next day he is completely free and at your service.
We all discussed it and agreed on a time - 14:00.
The next day came, and in the morning I received a call from the master and a statement that he would not be able to come, a complex request (what does that mean? where is the "completely free"?), and if he can come, he will arrive after 18:00 instead of the scheduled 14:00.
We agreed again the next day.
Fifteen minutes before the scheduled time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander, someone else may come, but it will be in two hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
One and a half days of empty waiting, all scheduled tasks forgotten!
In short, a competent master Ivan arrived and fixed the problem, for which we are grateful.
So don't fall for empty promises and don't waste your time for nothing.
The evening observations were completely unjustified of expectations.
First there was a small lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked through the telescope.
Everything was not very well organized, children kept going back to look several times, adults crowded and couldn't let others see.
The objects we looked at through the telescope were the size of a normal star, and you can see them for free without a telescope.
The girl answered questions rather inaccessibly, not realizing that ordinary people don't know many of the nuances.
It's unclear what the 600 rubles are for.
An amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has existed since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
Prices are average.
To sit and eat 2-3 dishes for two people (portions are very large) + a cocktail, around 2500 ₽ 👌
There are interesting beer cocktails based on beer and tequila, such as the Macho Borracho, which I highly recommend trying.
The price is 420 RUB for 0.5 L.
And in general, the food in the restaurant is very tasty, I don't know how it is for others, but I really liked it and will definitely recommend it to my friends!
A great store, I've been buying their products for quite some time, since they opened.
Good quality products.
I bought a mixer, and it has been working properly and in good condition for five years now.
Therefore, when we did a major renovation in the apartment, we got everything we needed here.
Great service!!!
It is very conveniently located, it is both in the center and at the edge of the region, in general, very convenient!
The gas quality is good, I fill up twice a week for more than two years now, and there are no problems. The price is excellent!!!
The eaglets are honest about the price on the map and when paying in cash, by the liter.
The store was great!
You can choose any model at a democratic price, for any purpose!
The staff are always ready to help with the selection.
I took a laptop to my daughter for studying, since her laptop crashed.
They helped, they found one, they gave a guarantee (one month). Thank you! 👍
A sommelier is on duty.
he helped choose the wine because it's hard to choose on your own from such a large menu.
Working with sommeliers is an interesting and charming experience, Vasily, there aren't enough of them in Moscow.
I ate pike perch - it was magical, the chef deserves respect.
The children's menu is the same as everywhere: pasta, fries, chicken nuggets. My kids ate pizza, it's AMAZING here!
The truffle was appreciated by adults, while the children enjoyed the ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - it's a bomb, soft, juicy, and aromatic.
The staff is good, everyone is smiling and friendly.
We liked it.
The brand new WB pickup point is located in a convenient location.
The schedule is 10.00 to 21.00, with no weekends or holidays.
There are fitting rooms inside the PVZ.
A very good place.
Here, real professionals work who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat in WhatsApp for informative communication.
Fast delivery.
It's nice that the product can be viewed and tried on immediately.
It's great that it's near the house.
A great, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything that is stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, there is a wide selection of dishes to suit any taste.
Convenient entrance, own parking near the entrance.
Hard 5.
A wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different shows.
Today we went to the play The Frog Princess.
At the moment, this is the best of the children's shows.
It was very interesting, there were a lot of puppets, special effects.
Even my 14-year-old son went just for the company, but he said it was a very good show.
We will be on vacation with my husband for 10 days in January 2023.
The holiday was a "5" - everything was great!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called to confirm the time of our arrival, provided information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00, the price was 850 rubles), arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, and the gate was opened without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, and they processed it quickly, in about 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have elevators, which is a big plus!
The 2-bedroom room is spacious, with warm floors both in the room and in the bathroom (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (a table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a lady's table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not too small, and there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in Building 5.
Everything is clean, they change the towels and bedding on request, but if you don't ask, they still change them on the fourth day, the bedding is of good quality.
The territory is well-maintained, there are benches everywhere, clean paths, and in the evening there is beautiful lighting.
A minibus takes people to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
It takes 5 minutes to get to the public transport stop.
In the dining hall, friendly boys are always ready to wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but everyone is here for different reasons, and we were all very satisfied, the choice and quality are always good, there is always fish and chicken and meatballs or the like, and vegetables as a side dish every day, there is their own delicious baked goods, more than four drinks, ground coffee, pancakes are always made for breakfast, but the cheese and sausage are not so great.
The medical staff are very friendly and accommodating.
We were also lucky with the weather, there were no rains, the temperature was 11-16 °C, and the sun was shining.
Everything was great, we really relaxed.
There is a desire to come back again, and specifically in January, when there are few tourists).
It's a shame that the swimming pool and fitness complex will never be put into operation.
Thank you to the entire staff of the sanatorium for their coordinated and high-quality work!
We've been going to "Polot" since August.
Daughter turned 4 in September.
Everything really suits her, the coach praises her) that's the most important thing.
We go to Valeriya Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I never would have thought that my daughter was so flexible!
While wandering the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to check out this promising establishment - and we were not disappointed!
The prices are very affordable, and the incredibly delicious pizza disappears in a flash, leaving no crust behind.
Pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in short, highly recommended :)
It just so happened that I ended up in the Tomarovsky Hospital with high blood pressure and a fast heartbeat.
I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning twice, and even the windows, furniture, and doors are wiped down.
The food is dietetic, but it's excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 in the morning they brought tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast snack.
The medical staff are sensitive, and they all give both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
While the drip is in place, they'll come in, ask about your condition...
I have had an ultrasound of the heart before, but to do it like this - for the first time (unfortunately, I don't know the name of the doctor, a young man).
Special thanks to the treating doctor, Klavdiya Fedorovna Vetokhina!
A true professional: attentive, knowledgeable, and gives a comprehensive answer to any question; she selected the dosage and medications that normalized both blood pressure and heart rate, which I was unable to achieve after consulting other doctors.
A huge thank you to the chief doctor, Olga Vladimirovna Mevsha, who organized the smooth operation of the hospital!!!
Thank you to the medical staff, nurses, and kitchen staff!
Visiting the customer service office left a good impression.
In the lobby, the administrator greeted us.
Knowledgeable and polite specialists quickly and patiently help clients with all the questions asked.
The specialist assisted in filing the application and provided explanations regarding my question.
For a small shop, the range of goods is quite good indeed.
There are semi-finished products, dairy products, vegetables, household chemicals, and various small items.
It operates 24/7, which is very convenient, and the staff is always friendly.
It's great when there's a place in the city where you can go mountain biking.
The chairlifts, both on weekends and weekdays, have a queue of 40 seconds for the descent and 5-10 minutes for the lift.
But overall, it's great, immersion in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if the roads are muddy and wet.
I turned to a service for iPhone 11 Pro repairs.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master, Alexander, directly, who explained all the nuances of the repair and immediately specified the price range.
Thank you for the repair, it was done well.
The masters are very pleasant to talk to, they will show you everything and tell you everything.
However, during the replacement of parts, the camera was damaged and the focus was disrupted.
She immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected in the shortest possible time, and everything is working properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is a pleasure to communicate.
The prices, compared to other services, are reasonable and affordable.
If I need repairs again, I will definitely call you!
Grand, beautiful, atmospheric.
However, like most historical objects, it requires careful, prompt, and high-quality attention from restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the owners
Great TV
Responsive concierges, garbage is collected, the area is clean and beautiful, and it is close to bus stops, schools, and shops.
20 minutes to the metro on public transport
A nice, cozy place to relax has opened in our district.
There are all the necessary shops.
A deadly and diverse food court in terms of food.
The tables are located in cozy areas.
There is no monotony.
Well, we went, we tried...
The interior has nothing in common with the cozy Italian cafés...
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, like in a dining hall.
Pizza... who hasn't tried it and not found it tastier? It seemed somehow bland to me.
It was not very pleasant that the waiter is always standing behind your back and your conversation partner across from you almost always looks directly into your face.
We felt uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, delicious.
We won't come back here and won't recommend it to our friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best hairdresser and makeup artist I have ever been to.
He does everything very carefully and professionally, and I enjoy going there knowing that everything will be done perfectly.
I take my daughter only to Len'.
The atmosphere in the salon is amazing.
Thank you very much!
We broke down on the way from Nizhny, and kind people from KatResurs quickly responded and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, there should be more such good people!
And the server is clean and nice there!
We came to a concert by Sergey Chigrakov.
A great concert venue, great sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely go to the scheduled concerts this year.
A quiet place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music on weekends and holidays!
The staff are pleasant and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Wonderful Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I love this place ❤
The park in the center of the city is very easy to get to.
The park is clean and there is something for both children and adults.
But the sandpit on the playground has been gone for a long time, all that's left is dust.
There is also a fenced football field, which unfortunately is not very well maintained.
But the advantages in our park are still greater.
The spacious hall is clean and the layout of the goods is clear and understandable.
There are products that can only be bought at Perekrestok.
The staff are friendly.
Bad products did not get through.
Often, discounts and promotions.
It's nice that it's close to home.
Parking is always available.
We went to the bar twice and everything was great, the staff were polite, the food was tasty, and most importantly, the music was excellent, the DJs know their stuff.
The only thing is that the lead singer of the "Hands Up Band" disappoints us the second time around.
Not only does he sing softly, to put it mildly, but he also reads the lyrics of most songs from his phone, especially when they were songs by the group "Hands Up!" This was particularly striking.
That's somehow illogical (speaking at the Rukki bar, in the Rukki Band group).
We went on vacation at the beginning of March.
A good hotel, nice rooms.
For the birthday, they gave us a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning is done every day.
Replenishing water, tea, coffee, shampoo, and changing towels.
Breakfasts are just amazing.
There is a mini-bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order food from the restaurant to your room, you will have to pay a 20% service charge on top.
The restaurant prices are slightly inflated.
Tastes like three plus.
The water park was included in the cost of accommodation.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseuse was simply a bombshell.
Everything is great, but the departure was a little disappointing: neither goodbye nor good travels.
Even the staff member at the entrance didn't help open the door when he saw the women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
We need to work on this to maintain the brand.
A great place to meet up with friends to have a sauna.
There is a large and comfortable sauna, a billiards table, an outdoor swimming pool, and karaoke.
The food is tasty, the drinks are fresh!)
The workshop is top-notch!
In a short time, I have already repaired three pairs of shoes (2 for men and 1 for women).
Everything's fine.
The quality of work is excellent.
Special thanks to the master for their careful treatment and quality work!
Great basketball school!
My son has been going for 5 months and he really enjoys it, he looks forward to every training session with great anticipation.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, a warm and friendly atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff are friendly, I order online myself.
The store's location is excellent.
Plus, there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good.
A good AV store has a convenient location, a large hall, and a good selection.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria with a few tables.
I often visit - everything is fine!
A good pool!
I am specifically talking about "Little Frog," our coach, Anastasia Vitalyevna, really likes the child and is very professional!
The locker rooms are clean, the water is warm, and there are hair dryers!
I love the bakeries' cakes, service, croissants, breakfasts, and coffee is always top-notch.
Unfortunately, this time it wasn't the case. I ordered a coffee and a couple of croissants, but the girls at the cash register never made the coffee, and I had to remind them. They made it, but it was impossible to drink, it smelled bad and left a bad aftertaste of spoiled milk, so I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time, there was a long black hair in my coffee, and they replaced it.
Please be more careful, I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Fabulous eyebrows are here!
Victoria does a great job of adjusting, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Waxing with warm wax, which effectively removes all the down, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected based on hair and skin type, which ensures that the dye lasts for a long time.
Nothing better than eyebrows!
Thank you so much for organizing my mother's move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company, everything went very smoothly, quickly, and professionally.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is top-notch.
We have been getting our teeth treated at Novodent for a long time, the whole family.
We recently had our 8-year-old son's teeth treated, and everything went really well. The child is calm and ready to come back again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because it's a scheduled appointment.
In my opinion, the best shawarma in Tambov is only here, I'm not a fan of shawarma, but when I want something unhealthy, I come here and only here.
The tasty, fresh meat has a lot of filling.
And I don't understand why, but it never flows for me.
Often, when you finish eating a shawarma, the bottom is no longer eaten because there's a lot of sauce and water, in short, it's foul... but not here.
So you guys are the best🙂
Good teacher staff.
In the dining room, they always serve fresh food.
Interesting lessons are held in the school museum, and various events are held throughout the school year
A pleasant shop, polite staff, and a decent selection.
However, a big minus is that the goods that are brought in are apparently destroyed right in the store.
Sometimes there is not enough space to walk between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are standing directly on the floor without pallets, but this is more of a comment on the organization rather than a specific store.
A magnificent example of Soviet architecture.
The strict grandeur, which is carefully maintained.
I got double the enjoyment from the concert, thanks in large part to the atmosphere of the cultural center.
While we waited in the lobby for the start, I definitely felt that I had come to an Event, that this was really a social occasion.
I was looking for a clutch set for my Mercedes Sprinter.
I completely randomly ended up in this online auto parts store.
I called, entered the code, and they said to wait.
After 10 minutes they called back and offered several options.
Since the car is a personal-use vehicle, he didn't want to save money and asked for a good LUK clutch set to be ordered.
Another 5 minutes later they called back and said that there was good news for you.
If we take the basket + disc + sieve set as a whole, rather than the LUK basket + disc set and the LUK sieve separately, it will be cheaper by 2,000 rubles, which couldn't fail to please.
I picked up the clutch and went to the service station.
When the gearbox was removed, it turned out that a flywheel was also needed, and the sooner the better.
I already knew where to turn to), the manager understood the situation and ordered without a prepayment on a phone call (the first time I also paid upon receipt).
The flywheel was in hand the next day.
The car is quite satisfied with the new clutch and gearbox, and I am satisfied that everything arrived quickly and that they were accommodating.
I will definitely recommend and use vinkod.shop without hesitation.
The New Year's party was a great success, but with a few hiccups.
I booked a two-seater table, but they seated me at a four-seater.
But no problem.
It's just strange that they didn't warn us.
The kitchen is a four, and the fish was a complete failure.
The host of the competition with challenges made at the elementary school level, to be honest, is not very good.
BUT the music is perfect.
The atmosphere was top-notch.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thank you for the event you organized
I am leaving my review, with words of thanks to the entire staff of the 7th maternity hospital in Chelyabinsk.
This institution employs only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from heaven.
In both the obstetrics department and the delivery room, as well as the postpartum department.
But I would like to express special thanks to Kotlyarova E.Y., the head of the delivery department on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., the midwife in the delivery department, thank you so much for your help in the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, and for your enormous professionalism.
A wonderful shop.
A wide selection of balls, fast order processing, and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We visited the establishment based on a recommendation.
The food is amazing, the program is nonexistent, the waiters are a bit cheeky, but we were in a great group with children and celebrating an important event, so we were friendly.
There was no fireworks display, the children were waiting.
You can confidently go for the good food.
