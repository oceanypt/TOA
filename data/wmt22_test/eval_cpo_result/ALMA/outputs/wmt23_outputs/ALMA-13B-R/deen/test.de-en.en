Diego Cocca will become the new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup together with the USA and Canada, with a record 48 teams participating. Cocca will take over from Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early exit from the World Cup in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not considered a favorite for the position until just a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His unexpected appointment as national coach caused friction within the club.
Geesthacht: New planting signs are intended to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Umwelt, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) put up the plant signs in the flowerbeds of the pedestrian zone.
The action "Geesthacht blooms" also includes information about what is currently in bloom there - currently in the colours white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht is blooming" is an action by the Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. Since 2015, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted in the ground with the help of many volunteers from associations, schools, kindergartens, companies, and institutions. The goal is to create extensive flower meadows in the Geesthacht city area, where insects can find food at all times. "When the weather is favorable, the bees fly out in January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from the Geesthacht Nabu. He himself has beehives on the property.
In order for the initiative not to remain just an action by nature conservationists and the environmental department of the city, but to reach out to private gardens as well, explanatory signs are regularly placed next to the plants. So far, there have been about 50 such signs. Passers-by are supposed to be able to inform themselves in this way about what is currently blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will then plant specific species at home.
In the first week of January, the season already started for the wild hazel
More recent additions to the pedestrian zone's flower beds include shrubs such as the winterberry honeysuckle and wintersnowball. They have now been in the soil of the pots along Bergedorer Straße for a year, and are just now starting to show their first delicate white and pink blossoms without leaves. They have also recently been marked with additional signs. "The winterberry honeysuckle is a very broad-leaved shrub that can grow up to two meters high and three meters wide," one can read there, along with other information about the appropriate location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the garden plants are now showing flowers, but the wild hazel also started its season in the first week of January. It blooms particularly abundantly along the Richtweg at the incline, in the Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg, and many bends.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "The steppe keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of them if he looked down from heaven at the Munich Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at exactly 3 p.m. for a lively dance routine - together they are an incredible 277 years old, pardon, young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native Munich resident (born on January 15, 1921) from Schwanthaler Höhe, Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and stepping is my life, I can't imagine living without it."
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also swinging their dance legs.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, which today would be called a musical performer, and worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I have spent my life dancing, acting, and singing."
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is something like the baby of the group of stepp dancers. She says, "We simply have fun with our dance teacher Sissy Engl here."
Wikipedia: The step dance was developed in the United States in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. By attaching two metal plates, which are more durable than the initially used wooden soles, to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are created when dancing, which match the visual effect and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussionist. The English term for this is onomatopoeic tap dance, and the French term is claquettes. The Spanish flamenco dance may have been influenced by the step dance, in which the tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a well-audible sound when dancing.
Sissi Engl, 77 years old, is the soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer, and choreographer. "We are a big family here, where everyone is welcome, young and old, big and small."
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Movement keeps me young," says the 102-year-old to BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy eating, and no alcohol."
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
As digitalization progresses, some are rediscovering the appeal of analog
The speed with which our daily lives became digital left us little time to establish rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods accordingly, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either you were one of the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you knew someone from this exclusive group of people who lived in the neighborhood and you could call them to talk to your relatives over a bottle of Radeberger beer. Or you went to a phone booth. I will never forget the smell of the plastic headset or the sound of the coins dropping into the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the face of the person I was calling while talking to them - video telephony, I thought, what a wonderful thing that would be!
What next for Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also known as Moldova), President Maia Sandu has tasked former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with forming the government.
For this, the 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. Recean was one of the President's advisors until now.
After only 18 months in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita unexpectedly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself stated as the reason for her resignation - apparently, she was harassed by pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for their "enormous sacrifices."
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and suffers from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European PAS party founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 of the 101 seats. The confirmation of the new prime minister and his cabinet should therefore not pose a problem.
However, pro-European politicians in Moldova have lost popularity in recent months, while pro-Russian ones have become more popular, thanks to support from the Kremlin.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023, Veitshöchheim will celebrate in style again. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities didn't hesitate to come.
Father of the nation Markus Söder did not appear as Moses, as his costume suggests. He sees himself more as the elder of the Bavarian tribe. His wife Karin Baumüller-Söder is by his side.
Bavaria's Environment and Consumer Protection Minister, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the children's hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea, Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja came to Franconia.
Completely out of this world: Minister for Science and Art, Markus Blume, is going into space.
Landtag President Ilse Aigner chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as a role model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's Health Minister Klaus Holetschek with wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder alias Construction Minister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff at carnival: Bavaria's interior minister Joachim Herrmann, accompanied by his wife Gerswid.
On the roller coaster: Economy Minister Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to the crafts with his costume. His partner, Tanja Schweiger, the district administrator of Regensburg County, does the same.
Of course, the political opposition was also present.
All for Bavaria: Green Fraction leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the SPD faction leader's passion: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
Royal was at FDP faction leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly says more. In Veitshöchheim, the leader of the European Parliament group, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a mime, accompanied by his wife, Andrea.
If politics doesn't work out, he can at least do magic. Nuremberg's mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.
Quick as a bee on the move: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of the BR, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth, and BR culture program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small jab at the climate activists from the Franconian Tatort detective Sebastian Fleischer, played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the First Mayor of Veitshöchheim was also there. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in the World Championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now already collected 14 world titles and is catching up to his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen, the biathlon icon who is present as a TV expert on site. Björndalen is still the undisputed record champion with 20 gold medals at the World Championships, but Bö was not deterred from collecting his second gold at the Rennsteig by occasional heavy fog. On Wednesday, he had already successfully defended his title with Norway's mixed relay team.
Hardly anyone doubts that the third hunt will follow. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favourite. His running form is outstanding, enabling him to easily compensate for shooting errors to a certain extent.
Meanwhile, Doll was not having any luck again. After the veteran had squandered all chances of a medal at the start with a penalty round in the mixed relay and only managed sixth place, things did not improve three days later. Three penalty rounds in the prone and two more standing were a great disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
Six years ago in Hochfilzen, he surprisingly won by a mere 0.7 seconds ahead of Bö, with a razor-thin lead. It was one of only three career victories for Doll, who has been on the podium this winter only once so far. After his weak performance, the eighth-place finisher from the Beijing Olympics left silently and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees managed to finish in 19th place, while the second debutant at the World Championships, David Zobel, finished in 35th place.
Biden welcomes Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
At a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his counterpart from Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the focus is mainly on the value of democracy. Both look back at their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden emphasized the importance of democratic values during a visit to his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," said Biden on Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Lula responded, referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula prevailed in a runoff election against Bolsonaro at the end of October. On January 1, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by violent riots. In January, Bolsonaro supporters stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the government seat in the capital Brasília. The violence in Brazil recalls in a dark way the storming of the US Capitol two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently entered the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor didn't care much about international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, in the morning, afternoon, and evening," said Lula. "Sounds familiar," Biden replied - an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
A brief note about the press - Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? They showed the members of the Red Army Faction who had been released for denunciation and execution.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed before Corona, public sentiment was whipped up against the most dangerous enemies of the Federal Republic; let's say, the bourgeois democracy, let's say, the late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the really dangerous ones in striped suits and ties.)
Now, the Stuttgart newspaper, which is usually more interested in Raudis in the S-Bahn or masturbators in the park, is reprinting the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a photo gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there may be more "Russian friends" in this world, which includes Asia, Africa, and Latin America, than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not the point: Frau Wagenknecht is in first to fifth place (!), followed by Frau Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my vicinity who reads this paper anymore. If they do, it's high time now. We've reached the well-known level where there's nothing left below it.
And by now, quite dialectically speaking, Frau Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician among all those people who are not yet completely brainwashed, i.e. those who are peace-loving, pacifist, and anti-militarist. (And no further differentiation is needed here.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his partner Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in identical wording. There he said: "I can confirm that my client has filed a request for dissolution of his civil partnership with his family lawyer at the relevant court through his family lawyer. I do not wish to comment on the details."
Glööckler and his partner Schroth were together for 35 years, and rumors of a split have been circulating for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from their home in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marriage problems in the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins remain, a memorial center was established in 1999. Last year, France's President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the national Order of Merit. Hébras had fought for freedom and defended the values of France, Macron said. He had also contributed to Franco-German reconciliation. The survivor had, among other things, advocated for German-French youth exchanges.
A curved layout for 14 houses: In Homeien, everyone knows everyone
LZ series Nordlippische Weiler: In Homeien, it is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof. Here, the residents find pure idyllic bliss. In the summer, up to 300 motorcycles a day roar along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even back again the same day.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes to be "absolutely" necessary in the fight against the high inflation rate. "Inflationary risks remain high. Energy costs could easily rise again, and the opening up of China could also give prices a temporary boost," Sewing told the "Welt am Sonntag."
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the Eurozone for the fifth time in a row at the beginning of February and announced another increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The interest rate in the Eurozone is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money with the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can dampen demand and thus counter high inflation rates. Higher interest rates can also lead to investments being postponed, thereby weakening economic growth.
Even for highly indebted Eurozone countries such as Italy, rising interest rates are a burden. "The consequences of persistent high inflation are much more serious than higher financing costs for some countries," said Sewing. "Of course, we have to keep this in mind, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB aims for medium-term price stability in the euro area at an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been far from reach for months. In January, inflationary pressure eased again, but consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 member states were still 8.5 percent higher than the previous month's level.
Higher inflation rates erode the purchasing power of consumers, as they can then afford less with each euro. Rising energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, "private consumption will sooner or later collapse," warned Sewing, who is also the President of the Association of German Banks (BdB). "That is currently the biggest threat to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany speed" for infrastructure projects announced by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialogue about this. And it may also be a bit more controversial," he said to the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a framework will emerge that is not necessarily as fast as the LNG terminals that came into operation around the turn of the year, but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to partially close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas deliveries. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke at the occasion of a new "German speed". In addition, the federal government has recently accelerated the approval process for wind turbines and power lines.
First of all, it is reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. However, this should not automatically mean that we now always act so categorically and, for example, force a wind turbine onto our neighbour against his will. Hartung said that there must therefore still be a process of negotiation about what is right and wrong for society.
In the past, they tried to use the classic rulebook and failed. "We should think again about whether the previous approach was really the right one. Perhaps we overdid it with the rulebook and made it too complicated for ourselves."
Given the many open tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, Hartung does not envy the federal government or the involved companies. "As a consumer of these energies, I need the expansion urgently and it should be as green as possible," he said.
Union warns of the dismantling of the Bayer conglomerate
The chemical union IG BCE warns of the dismantling of the Bayer company following an announced change of leadership. "From the perspective of the employees, Bayer is exactly right with its three pillars to face the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, a member of the union's board and a member of Bayer's supervisory board, to the Rheinische Post (Saturday edition).
The pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health sector with over-the-counter drugs, and the agricultural sector are meant. "Industry transformation can only be managed by a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - not by hedge fund activism."
The background is the announced CEO change at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical conglomerate announced on Thursday. The controversial CEO Werner Baumann will vacate his post this summer. Bill Anderson, the former head of the Swiss rival Roche's pharmaceutical division, is expected to take over in early June.
Baumann has been under fire for a long time. The 2018 acquisition of the US seed producer Monsanto for $6.3 billion is hanging over the manager's head. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company got itself into expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks associated with the herbicide glyphosate. The Bayer share had been in a downward spiral for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to release the board chairman at the annual general meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann does not intend to extend his contract, which was originally due to expire in 2024. Pressure was exerted by long-term oriented strategic investors. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors, such as Bluebell Capital, also got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for the company to be split up.
The very small fund with an unknown level of participation in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health sector would be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, to the Rheinische Post. On the other hand, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger Crop Science agricultural division to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against the pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, the French also want to take to the streets again to protest against the planned pension reform.
The unions are mounting a mass protest on the streets against a government initiative. Hundreds of thousands are set to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, on Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to take to the streets nationwide to protest against the planned pension reform by President Emmanuel Macron. For the fourth time, trade unions are mobilizing against the plans of the center-government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Already twice, more than a million people have taken to the streets, and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted at protests. For the past week, a turbulent debate has been raging in parliament over the controversial reform.
Already now, many people in France work beyond the age of 62, when they have not yet contributed long enough for a pension without deductions, if they reach the retirement age before having worked long enough. In many demanding professions, people could hardly work any longer, the opponents of the reform argue. They also wanted to enjoy their well-earned pension and not wear out their health completely at work.
Macron: Threatening deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. As the population gets older, the number of pensioners is increasing, and the employed have to make up the difference with their contributions. To keep the pension level stable, the population needs to work a little more. The critics doubt the government's calculations and call for the state to find other sources of income to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government is not only planning to tighten the screws when it comes to retirement age. The already approved increase in the required contribution period for a full pension is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to about €1,200.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important initiatives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the first attempt to implement the reform was aborted, then as now there were massive protests and strikes. Many presidents before Macron have attempted to reform the French pension system, with varying degrees of success - widespread protests and strikes were a certainty.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have pledged their support. However, some of the deputies - even from Macron's own faction - still have reservations. And at the moment, Macron is probably more worried about crippling strikes than a narrow vote. Before the new demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organizers' sense of responsibility to ensure that they passed peacefully and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather expected - lots of sun in the highlands
A powerful high-pressure area is located over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that sunny weather can be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, at least until the middle of the week, calm high-pressure weather is expected. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area immediately stands out directly over Central Europe," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Although this high moves slightly eastwards over the course of the next week, it will continue to dominate the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "A high-pressure system can actually be quite nasty and bring the people in the lowlands days of gloomy high-cloud fog, while in the highlands of the mid-range mountains there is nothing but sunshine."
Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. According to the DWD, it may also rain a little in the Erzgebirge and Thuringian Forest, as well as in Lower Bavaria. In particular, at the Alpine edge, but also in the southwest and parts of the west, the cloud cover lifts during the day and the sun comes out more and more often. The rest of the country remains heavily overcast or shrouded in high fog. Temperatures range from 4 to 9 degrees, with 10 degrees near the Rhine.
On Monday, the sun will then nibble away again at the slowly strengthening fog, gradually dissolving it more and more over the course of the day, says the meteorologist. In the Alpine foothills, in the highlands of the mid-range mountains, and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, full sun is expected all day long. Elsewhere, the sun will have to fight its way through the fog layer. The highest temperatures will be between 5 and 9 degrees Celsius, while in the Niederrhein region temperatures are expected to reach 11 degrees Celsius. In the perpetual grey of the southeast, however, temperatures are only expected to reach 3 degrees Celsius. There will also be a light breeze blowing from different directions.
On Tuesday, there may be only slow clearing of fog or high fog in some low-lying areas. Otherwise, the weather is expected to be sunny after the fog has cleared. According to the forecasts, the sun is expected to shine all day in high-altitude areas, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, and along the Alpine border. Temperatures are expected to rise to between 5 and 11 degrees Celsius, depending on the amount of sunshine.
Dominator struggles: No more World Championship medals for Goggia
The beaten top favorite Sofia Goggia showed herself to be severely disappointed after being eliminated in the alpine skiing downhill event at the World Championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't deliver the performance I'm capable of," the Italian said on ZDF after she had set up a goal and been eliminated. At least, the 30-year-old managed to just barely avoid a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill racer in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six season races in this discipline so far. After winning gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she took silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, she still has to wait for a medal at the World Championships in her main discipline, as she is known for her risky driving style. She missed the home race in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was doing well. It was about hundredths of a second," said Goggia after the surprising victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. "I'm disappointed. I gave it my all. But that's life. Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, but they're not." She said about the medal that was expected by all experts and ultimately missed: "It's not."
Girl missing in Berlin: Who has seen Viktoriya?
Since February 10, Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at the S-Bahn station Waidmannslust. The police are asking for information about her whereabouts.
Berlin. The Berlin police are asking the public for help in the search for a missing child by publishing a photo. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is believed to have left the grounds of her school together with other children towards the S-Bahnhof Waidmannslust at around 12:30 on February 10, 2023. She was last seen at the S-Bahnhof Waidmannslust. The child arrived in Berlin as a refugee in April 2022 and has very limited German language and local knowledge.

Selenskyj and Ministers Against Russia's Olympic Participation
Kyiv. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympics in Paris, sports politicians from 35 countries have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
It was agreed at a joint telephone conference to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sport announced on its website.
"We call for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation had taken place at the initiative of the United Kingdom. It was a very productive meeting, wrote British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. "And I have made our position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus cannot be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this topic."
Previously, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place at sporting and Olympic competitions," said Zelensky. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Ultimately, he said, due to the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag stained with blood was also unacceptable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a war party, as the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Selenskyj called on officials to defend the Olympic principles and to prevent the participation of Russian athletes in the competitions. The president also reiterated his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which he said has "unfortunately lost its integrity."
The purpose of the conference was the IOC's announcement that it intends to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine has also threatened to boycott if the IOC allows the athletes to compete.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sport, subsequently stated that it had also reaffirmed its position during the consultations to reject the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian athletes back to competitions. The international sports community must continue to provide unconditional solidarity and support to Ukrainian athletes. The IOC's efforts to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes are the wrong approach," a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior said in response to a dpa query.
Federal Minister of the Interior Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the civilian population of Ukraine. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Meanwhile, Russia insists that sport and politics must be kept separate.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sporting competitions. The IOC, however, aims to return athletes from both countries to the international sporting stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently stated that exclusion "based on a passport or place of birth" violates the ban on discrimination.
Blame it where it happens
"Hey, nice butt!", the fool calling after the woman in the tight sexy outfit and making suggestive remarks: all of this falls under the term "catcalling" (German: catcalling). Behind the term hides nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost? : USA see Moscow's tank fleet severely depleted
Half of the vehicles lost? The US sees Moscow's tank fleet severely depleted
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the start of the war. The figure mentioned is "half of the main stock".
The Russian army has lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, according to estimates by the US Department of Defense. "Probably half of the main tank stock of the Russian army has been destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs.
Wallander did not provide further details about the number of tanks, as assessed by the United States, that were seized and destroyed during an online event hosted by the think tank Center for a New American Security.
In the coming weeks, Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies. The UK has pledged to deliver Challenger-2 battle tanks to Kyiv in March. Germany intends to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine in cooperation with other states by April. The US has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams battle tanks, but their delivery is likely to take much longer.
Russia wants to step up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitri Medvedev promised the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has begged for planes, missiles, and tanks," said Medvedev, who is now the deputy head of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that for us in this case it is a matter of course to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology - including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that enables a stronger economic focus on the needs of the army. This means that individual sectors can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Controversy over army post appointments
Because the position that the former director of the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum (HGM), Christian Ortner, will now occupy was not advertised, the personnel representative of the Academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the approach.
A tender is not required because the appointment is to an unfilled position, the minister said. "I do not want to comment on the speculations of a liberal personnel representative," she added. Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of the HGM, amid criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past and accusations of serious bullying. In Tanner's view, these issues have been resolved.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ornter's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ is demanding that Tanner provide clarification on the "unusual order process". The "appearance of patronage" hangs over the decision, said SPÖ defense spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to their necks in the swamp of corruption," said Douglas Hoyos, defense spokesman for the party. He announced that he would submit a parliamentary inquiry on the matter.
Carnival: The first fools go down on cost
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to hold on to the traditional carnival parade in a different way than the state capital. However, the higher costs, for example for security, are difficult to bear in Wasungen as well, says carnival president Marcel Kißling. The costs alone for this amount to roughly half of the estimated total cost of the parade.
In Brandenburg, there are no cancellations of carnival parades. The "Parade of the Happy People" in Cottbus, which is likely to be the largest in East Germany once again, is taking place for the first time after the pandemic. The Swabian-Alemannic Carnival also did not cancel any parades.
Despite rising costs, the carnival stronghold of Marne in Schleswig-Holstein is sticking to its traditional parade. "We're holding our event," says Heiko Claußen, president of the carnival society. But even here, financial worries are weighing in: If more sponsors couldn't be found or the existing ones didn't contribute more, reserves would have to be tapped - "that's not possible every year." The current deficit is around 200,000 euros.
And inflation: There has been a price increase of up to 60 percent for some confectionery items, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Carnival Parade Support Association. Fortunately, too much was ordered in 2020, so there is still enough stock this year. However, it is already clear that the parade will be more expensive this year. Twice as much staff will be required for security as in 2020.
Anyone standing by the roadside during the Cologne Carnival procession on Rosenmontag (Shrove Tuesday) in the Rhineland may receive fewer sweets than in previous years. Because sweets have become more expensive, some procession participants may not have as much with them. Sweets aside, the number of visitors is likely to be high: "I believe that if it doesn't rain from buckets on that day, we can definitely expect an increase in the number of people," says Holger Kirsch, the Cologne procession director. "This is due to the fact that two years ago there was no regular Rosenmontag procession. The procession is, of course, irreplaceable."
The Cologne Carnival Committee does not go into detail about the costs. However, the parade is generally "loss-making" and that is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Homemade Vodka
The Ukrainians are not without reason known for their drinking prowess. There is local beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. From time to time, I also discover German beer here. It's not Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't really detect a big difference in the taste. The vodka, which is widely available, is also distilled here, mainly in the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that the consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can't really believe the Russians. As a tourist, you should be careful with it, but only if it's sold in large quantities. Then it's probably adulterated.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards hard work: "Match luck on our side"
Food and drink
Those who want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or enjoy a beer after work can find great venues in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or pre-partying for club nights. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Championships: The Federal President sees a favourite win and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender will be welcomed to the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal ceremony at the World Cup sprint in Oberhof. However, there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, from the honorary box it was not possible to see whether the targets at the shooting range were really falling on Saturday. "I had to check the results on my phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier said with a smile, and pointed to the ever-present mist clouds that repeatedly drifted over the stadium, obscuring the view for spectators on the Rennsteig.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, receiving numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by biathlon," he revealed, and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The newly renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes agree, and I would like to thank those who have been working on the site since the World Championships were awarded to Oberhof." In terms of sustainability, the location is now "a step ahead" of many others and "secure for the next years and even decades to come."
Once again, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö outpaced the competition in the sporting arena. Despite a penalty loop after a shooting error, he secured victory in 23:21.7 minutes, his sixth win in the sixth sprint of the winter season, and his second world championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his brother Tarjei, who shot flawlessly (14.8 seconds behind), Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty loop/39.9 seconds), and Johannes Dale (1 penalty loop/43.6 seconds) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory.
The local ski hunters were unable to enter the medal race the day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished in eighth place after a shooting error and with a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes, the best of the Germans. WM-debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished in twelfth place (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the grey cloud. In contrast, Benedikt Doll once again disappointed. After his botched mixed performance on Wednesday, the Schwarzwälder left five targets standing this time and disappeared deeply disappointed and without comment into the locker room in 55th place.
Bö went into the race as number one in front of 14,300 spectators and manifested this status despite the difficult visibility conditions. However, he was lucky with his last two standing shots; they landed on the edge of the targets and still counted. The award ceremony was then enjoyed by the 29-year-old together with his five-years-older brother: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is hardly any doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. In contrast, the German women's hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. "If you start as number one, the goal is not to finish in tenth place. It's all about full speed and attack to defend the number one spot," said sports director Felix Bitterling, putting his "locomotive" to the test. The organizers expect a nearly sold-out arena for the double event (13.25 and 15.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych is displeased by the "swarm of bees" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on the referee's ball.
Aggressive players or whining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanlike behavior. Chief referee Fröhlich points to a role model function.
German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative trends in the way players interact on the field. "I think there are new player behaviors that surround the referee after decisions like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old to the German Press Agency. "We discussed this during the winter break. We decided that we don't want to accept such unsportsmanlike behavior. We will pay more attention to this and will also sanction it."
Most recently, two coaches were also given yellow-red cards. Mainz coach Bo Svensson saw the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich, it was the yellow-red card in the league defeat in Dortmund. "The coaches' behavior also falls under the category of unsporting behavior. We have noticed that unsporting behavior has increased in this area as well, that the behavior towards referees has become more demanding or aggressive. We also want to consistently punish such unsporting behavior," said Brych.
DFB referee chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed to a generally good coexistence between coaches and referees. "Overall, the relationship is good. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person affected then has to live with that. That shouldn't be a big deal," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"Emotions can certainly lead to conflicts in the course of a game, but if the emotions spill over into personal insults, then one must also accept that the corresponding measures will be taken by the referees," said Fröhlich. In the most recent cases, the parties involved have sorted things out after the fact. "It's only important that, after that, there is also a process of rethinking overall, so that such behaviour simply doesn't belong," Fröhlich said on the sidelines of an event hosted by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible effects on other levels. "Of course, incidents from professional football always cast a shadow. There is a role model effect, which leads to imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviour," said Fröhlich. "Independent of the consistent application of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and the affected parties, is always helpful."
Combiner Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country skiing race. The overall leader from Austria, Johannes Lamparter, came in second. Third place went to Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German Nordic combined team is not at full strength in the Black Forest. Pyeongchang Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel, and Johannes Rydzek are not there. They are training in Oberstdorf for the World Championships, which will be held in Planica, Slovenia, from February 21 to March 5. "We have three world-class athletes at home. The team obviously feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch in ZDF.
Seven lightly injured in pile-up on A5
Seven people were slightly injured in a four-vehicle accident on the A5 highway at Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar district), including two children. According to a police report, the accident occurred on Saturday when a driver crashed into a car from behind during a slight traffic jam and pushed it onto two more cars. The lane closure in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about 1.5 hours.
Finissage at the Marl Sculpture Museum
They launched the exhibition: the initiators, Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right), stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his wall painting.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition at the Marl Sculpture Museum will come to an end. There will be some extras for the finale.
The closing event for the exhibition "Wallbound" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. at the Marl Sculpture Museum's temporary quarters on Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format wall paintings each draw attention to themselves.
After the exhibition, the walls will be repainted and the artworks will disappear. However, a catalog documents the works specifically created for the Marler Museum, which will be presented on February 12 by the curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the closing event, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on community-oriented wall art. Using numerous image examples, she will present the particularities of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and ask about the links to this art genre in the Federal Republic, with a focus on North Rhine-Westphalia in the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and in 2013 earned her doctorate on the mural art of the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching architectural art and the art and institutional history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in public buildings in North Rhine-Westphalia. After the lecture, the final curator's tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists are present.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It concerns building defects that contributed to the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In the south of Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects following building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants have been issued against about 33 people, according to the state news agency Anadolu on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The suspects are believed to be responsible for construction defects that contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
The prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings, according to Anadolu. So far, 62 arrest warrants have been issued as part of these investigations, it was reported. One of the suspects was reportedly arrested at the airport in Istanbul. He was allegedly trying to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody. Nine other people were reportedly arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early on Monday morning, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake shook the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another magnitude 7.6 earthquake in the afternoon. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed alone in Turkey.
Former East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow has died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the Left Party in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old died in the night to Saturday. Fraction chair Dietmar Bartsch paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left Party politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
"Last night, Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95," the Left party in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party thus loses "an important personality," said Fraktionsvorsitzender Dietmar Bartsch and former Fraktionsvorsitzender Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st Secretary of the SED district leadership in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the Berlin Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for around 150 days. In the Volkskammer elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power, and Modrow lost his office a month later. Lothar de Maizière, a CDU politician, became the last Prime Minister of the GDR until reunification.
The co-chair of the Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short messaging service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist." Bartsch added:
"He was a wise counselor to our party until a high age, whose wisdom will be missed."
"The entire peaceful course of the unification of Germany was a special achievement of him. That will be his political legacy," wrote Bartsch and Gysi in their obituary. It continues:
His later work in the Volkskammer, the Bundestag, the European Parliament, and as an honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing those parts of the former GDR population that were not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated, even though their interests were not wanted.
After reunification, Modrow served in the German Bundestag for the PDS from 1990 to 1994, and represented the party in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state "quite critically." The German reunification had taken place too quickly, the DDR had disappeared too unconditionally, and it had been condemned too one-sidedly as an "unjust state," Modrow reportedly criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened at night
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kyiv has to carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kyiv - The latest wave of Russian rocket attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs to the Ukrainian energy network. However, Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several heat and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, said Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, the head of energy supplier Ukrenerho, on Friday evening in Ukrainian television. The power supply situation in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid. A reactor block at the Chmelnyzkyj nuclear power plant had to be shut down due to the unstable situation in the Ukrainian power grid, and production at the Rivne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants has been reduced.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles on Friday as terrorism. In a video message, however, he reported to his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received on its trip to London, Paris, and Brussel this week.
Selenskyj does not want to leave the small town of Bachmut behind
On February 24, war has been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to the important Ukraine supporter Poland just before the anniversary. Meanwhile, the danger of Russian rocket attacks persisted overnight into Saturday. In the capital Kiev, the air raid sirens were sounded for the fifth time that day late on Friday evening. "There is a threat of a drone attack," the military administration of the Kyiv region announced. Drones of Iranian design were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolajiw and Odessa regions in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects advisors for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens during the election campaign to separate them failed due to the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, they had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, but in the future, this company is to be oriented towards the common good. This means that it does not have to generate profits and pay them out.
80 billion euro repair backlog
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government to manage this process. The backlog in the rail network is a major reason why the railways are currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has made it his mission to eliminate this deficiency by carrying out comprehensive renovations of entire railway corridors. The investments required for this have been estimated at up to 50 billion euros so far. However, according to more recent calculations by the railways, they are actually closer to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances apparently did not speak in favor of Herrmann-Wick at all. She said after the race that she had had a bad night's sleep, was "totally nervous," and that her pulse had not come down even when she entered the race. "A race like that," and at the home World Cup, "can't be described in words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered along to the thumping Schlager music with German flags, coaches and team members hugged each other.
"I wanted to enjoy biathlon," she said she had decided
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure was particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope outside of the relay races. This winter, Herrmann-Wick has been the only German to win two World Cup races. She is currently ranked fifth in the overall World Cup standings. And although the level of performance among the women at the top is much higher than among the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, one had expected someone else to win this sprint.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been strained since 2018. At that time, demonstrators who called for Ortega's resignation sought refuge in churches. More than 350 people died in the protests in 2018. In the following years, thousands of people left the Central American country, often out of fear of reprisals or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiring with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry demands more orders from special funds
First defense projects have already been scrapped, and others are at risk of the same fate, as reported by Welt am Sonntag. It is currently not possible to say which specific investments would be affected. "There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a potential need for savings at this point in time," says the German government's response to an inquiry by Ingo Gädechens, a member of the Bundestag (CDU).
The reason for the declining investment sum is the rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund that the Bundestag approved in June 2022 must bear the interest burden of the loans itself. As a result, less money is available for the Bundeswehr's specific acquisitions when interest rates rise. In addition, the current high inflation reduces the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
On the night of Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01:40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, traveling from Kupferzell, wanted to turn left onto the highway toward Heilbronn at the Kupferzell highway on-ramp, coming from the direction of Kupferzell. At that time, a 21-year-old VW driver was traveling along the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, as the police reported. During the BMW driver's turn, the two vehicles collided.
Both accident participants reported that the traffic light system installed at the accident site showed "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic light system revealed no defects. Further investigations will follow. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old, and the passenger in the BMW were all slightly injured in the accident. They had to be hospitalized. The total damage to the two cars amounted to approximately 20,000 euros.
Stuttgart's Schlossplatz commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgart residents followed the call of the Ditib Mosque community in Feuerbach on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
The earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria has gripped the world. More than 200 people gathered on the Stuttgart castle square on Friday evening to mourn the victims and pray for them.
Many members of the community followed the call of the Ditib Mosque in Feuerbach, young and old, men and women. They all listened to the Imam's prayer with seriousness and silence. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could also overcome this disaster. He asked for, among other things, health, protection from plagues, and respectful coexistence. The community also asked for assistance and strength "to bring our help to the earthquake-affected areas."
Ditib stands by the side of the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for the victims and their families, of whom there were more than 22,000 at the time of the memorial event. The prayers were also translated into German on the castle square.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. Already several million euros have been raised through the fundraising campaign of the Turkish-Islamic Union of Anatolia (Ditib).
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected material donations in the Glockenstraße over several days, which are to be transported by truck to the earthquake zones. The generosity there was also overwhelming.
Meat-filled hiking trail - Ebersberg
"After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps ..." ... The older generation knows this saying, but the younger generation simply puts it into practice. In any case, during the years of the pandemic, the old-fashioned digestive walk has undergone an unexpected renaissance. After all, those who work from home are no longer in the middle of a stone desert, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests, and meadows. In the Egglburger See area, at least, one gets the impression that between 12 and 14 o'clock there are not only dog owners out and about.
One reason could also be that modern man, in the course of optimal time slot utilization, can combine the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things. After all, why not take advantage of a short walk through nature to catch up with news from the settlement from the long-unseen neighbor? Or meet up with the friend with whom one never manages to go to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Old Cinema? In this way, one can also combine work and private life - who says that a meeting with a tax advisor, lawyer, or investment advisor can't take place outdoors, provided there are no eavesdroppers nearby?
Another thing that can be done very well is the acquisition of natural goods. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands on a table by the roadside along with cheese. Or potatoes and meat. It's a pity, though, if you haven't thought about the purchase in advance and made the necessary arrangements. An elderly married couple leaves the farmer's wooden sales room in Hinteregglburg empty-handed and with a note of regret in their voices. "Too bad, we forgot the money."
The disappointment can be felt, as one does have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. This is something the friendly acquaintance also makes clear. To which the man replies: "That's not true! You do have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which was quickly thrown on before leaving the house, although the sunshine made an additional head covering unnecessary. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that one embarks on the return journey with a meat filling, and that on this midday excursion one not only acquires a lamb loin, but also an extremely practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be in order that day - after dinner. This time, however, for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen and for some unknown reason veered off to the right in a left-hand curve, according to the police report. The Audi collided with a signpost, hit a tree side-on, and came to a stop a few meters away. The driver was trapped in his car as a result of the collision and was freed by the fire brigade using heavy equipment. The ambulance took the seriously injured man to the hospital. As there was a suspicion of intoxication, a blood sample was ordered to be taken. The Audi sustained total damage worth 1000 euros, according to the police report.
Donald Trump's tax documents: a point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided: The tax authority must hand over the former president's tax returns to Parliament.
Trump in 2018, still in office as President of the United States
The Finance Ministry must instruct the tax authority IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, the decision of the ministry on Friday said.
Contrary to political custom in the United States, the real estate mogul Trump did not make his tax returns public either as a candidate or later as president. He fought all the way to the Supreme Court to prevent their disclosure. A prosecutor's office in New York has now received the documents, but no details can be made public from them - unless there is a trial.
The disclosure to Congress is likely to be more sensitive for Trump: The circle of those with access is somewhat larger there, and under certain conditions, details may be published during the course of the investigation by the committee. In addition, confidential information often leaks from the parliament as well.
The Speaker of the House, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, welcomed the decision immediately as a "victory for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax documents was a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his erosion of our security as President," Pelosi explained.
Kabarett in the Bastion: Life plays out between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract among the many offers? Stay or quit? Either - or? Today's people are slaves to time, rushing from one appointment to the next and sometimes just shoving people and hamburgers in between. Lucy van Kuhl shows in her new program that the "in-between" state is exciting.
Lucy van Kuhl humorously and thoughtfully tells and sings about situations in life. In her sensitive chansons and punchy, pointed cabaret songs, she hits the nail on the head - and there's more than meets the eye in some of them. The show starts on Saturday, February 18, at 8:30 p.m. at the Kirchheim club Bastion.
British heavy criminal captured in Thailand after long flight
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug trafficker from the UK has been caught in Thailand. As the British National Crime Agency (NCA) reported on Saturday, the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police in a car workshop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the NCA's "Most Wanted" list of most wanted criminals.
The leader of a criminal group fled early in 2018 before the start of a trial in which he was sentenced to eleven years in prison in absentia for attempting to import amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros), according to authorities.
Encounters at the church table
Bielefeld
What is served remains a secret in advance. After all, people are primarily supposed to come to the Vesper Church to meet others, not because there is something specific on the menu. This Sunday, the Neustädter Marienkirche will be transformed into a dining hall for two weeks.
Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has lived in Vienna for three years and according to his own account loves Viennese humor, champions science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo show, "Make Science Great Again," fits the bill. Whether it fits in with the widespread domestic skepticism towards science is another matter. His humor, however, fits very well in Vienna.
The English title, by the way, is also derived from Ebert's more recent life story, as he tried to establish himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. Now he's back and he tells his German-speaking audience not only about his experiences abroad, but also what Wissenaft actually is and what it can do - and what it can't. Of course, COVID-19 also comes up, as do German thoroughness in the bathroom and American ingenuity.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people push aside: What is really important? He does this with a huge wink and a smile, in a relaxed and very ironic way. And so, not only are we well entertained, but we also learn something in the process.
Please go for typing... it doesn't take long, doesn't hurt, and can save the lives of many people.

Peace and security in the era of change? On Monday, May 15 at 6:00 p.m., the Solidarity Church, the Peace Plenum, and the Evangelical City Academy are inviting you to a lecture and discussion event at the Evangelical University on the topic of "Peace and security in the era of change?"
I really don't understand why these events aren't held on Sundays. Or not in the city.

Microtransactions in Diablo IV: Blizzard reveals details and prices of monetization <URL> #DiabloIV #ActivisionBlizzard
After the political crisis and new elections in 2020, politicians of various stripes are travelling to Germany together (!) for the first time.
I'm looking forward to meeting and getting to know whoever I meet there :-)
Party colleague Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has eleven, as does the Ministry of Education under Anja Karliczek, who is also a CDU minister.
So, this is really nothing new, it's the same with every electronic ticket. Check-in/check-out is a different house number.
Certainly not a reason to do anything about tax evasion of 150 billion euros per year alone in Germany.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle scene from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley that is completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley there are rock pyramids and rock blocks that provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy fire.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as agile missiles, which, during the extended gameplay, become increasingly difficult to hit. In addition, UFOs appear periodically, which cannot attack the player's tank, but the player can achieve a high score by being hit by a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction mode, the game introduction mode, the gameplay mode, the initial entry for highest scores, and the self-test mode. The latter mode is a special mode for testing the controls and computer functions.
4. Gameplay
The gameplay is triggered when the pressure switch START is activated. The LED switch remains lit and the game sounds become audible. The game ends when the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker. The game starts with slowly moving tanks that appear on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by paying attention to the text that appears in the upper left corner of the cockpit display. A message may read, for example: ENEMY FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, the wide-ranging radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone, displays a point that represents the enemy position.
The upper, conical area on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the enemy is in this area, it is easy to target them on the screen. The text GEGNER IM FEUERBEREICH is also simultaneously displayed in the upper left hint display.
Occasionally, UFOs appear on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless flying objects that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank. The position of the UFOs cannot be detected by the radar. The UFOs are meant to round off the battle and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's tank and the enemy's tank. Eliminating a UFO earns the player 5,000 points. If the player hits an enemy tank, the following points are earned: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a missile, and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank moves and turns twice as fast as the player's tank or a slow-moving enemy tank. There are several options that give the player the opportunity to set up a game with 2, 3, 4, or even 5 tanks. In addition, after reaching certain point totals, a bonus tank can be unlocked, and the appearance of the missile can be varied to make the game more challenging. Details and the exact positions of the switches for these options are shown in the diagram.
5. Input of initials at highest scores
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the High Score Table, he or she can enter three (3) initials at the end of the game. The instruction is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that when a self-test is triggered, the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector-Generator PCB is pressed, or the power supply is interrupted, the High Score Table is deleted. When the RESET is triggered, the ten (10) highest scores with their initials are retained and re-entered on the screen to challenge other players. Any score over 100,000 is also marked with a tank symbol, followed by the initials of the player. If a player or player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically enter dashes. The machine then reverts to the attraction mode. CONSTRUCTION ORDER
1. New parts
The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) new components. If you have experience with video games from ATARI, you should be aware of these important differences. The new components are: A. The control lever. This is a redesigned version of the ATARI joystick. It has been reinforced by additional ribs in the inner and outer housing parts, making the unit more stable and ensuring proper contact between the switches. Another modification is the rubber centering piston, which, like a centering spring, always returns the control lever to the central position. The micro switches are now secured with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y game circuit has been extended onto two (2) interconnected boards. This is the Analog Vector Generator board and the auxiliary board. Thanks to this circuit technique, more lines can be displayed on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and even image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to provide the increased power supply required by the expansion of the circuit. D. The game cabinet. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new coin box with a larger coin capacity. In addition, the device has a console that is designed for smaller players as a podium, to make playing easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum stability at the installation site.
The new components, as well as all other major assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new components is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should still perform a certain inspection to complete the quality control process. To be sure that the device was delivered to you in proper working order, the following checks should be performed: NOTE: Device has not yet been connected to the 220 V power supply. A. Examine the exterior of the device for any damage. B. Open the maintenance cover and inspect the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all cable connectors for proper and secure connection. If any are open or loose, connect them together.
NOTE: Never force a connector into place. The connectors are equipped with a guide to ensure a correct connection. A connector twisted by 180 degrees destroys the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the game PC board for proper and secure fit. (3) Check the manufacturer's number on the device's nameplate on the back. Compare the stamped manufacturer's number with those of the Battlezone Analog Vector-Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, Regler/Audio II PC board, and the TV monitor. A diagram of the mounting location for the manufacturer's number is on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be given when you call your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other major components such as the power supply, control console, and TV monitor for proper mounting. (5) Finally, connect the device to the power supply and turn it on. Check through the player's viewing glass to see if the radar screen is centered in the bright, orange-ringed aperture of the cover. If the aperture is not centered exactly, the cover, which is secured with tape to the case, must be loosened and realigned. Before connecting the device to the power supply, make sure that the voltage selection switch on the power supply 1 (see Figure 3) matches the local power supply. Check the plug color and check the connection values as listed below:
HAVE YOU HAD PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below you will find a series of tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games. Checking System Configuration
Please take the time to check whether your system meets the requirements listed on the package. Using the DirectX Diagnostic Tool, you can get an overview of your system if you are not sure whether your PC meets the requirements. Please proceed as follows to call up the DirectX Diagnostic Tool: Click on the "Start" button and select the "Run" option. Enter "dxdiag" in the text field. The user interface of the DirectX Diagnostic Tool will now be displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about the graphics and sound card. You can check whether graphics and sound are working properly by clicking on the corresponding buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D, and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer knowledge, we would advise against changing any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool before starting the game.
It can happen that other programs occupy system resources that the game needs to run smoothly. Not all of these programs are obviously active, and many are automatically started when the system is booted. Such programs that are always active on the system are also called "background applications." In some cases, they can be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. Therefore, we recommend that you close such background applications before starting the game. - If antivirus or Crash Guard programs are running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. Look for the icon of the program in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the corresponding option ("Disable," "Close," or similar). - Once you have deactivated the antivirus and Crash Guard programs, you should also close general background applications, as they sometimes cause problems when installing or running a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to close all unnecessary background applications" below. Cleaning up the system
Before installing software, it is important to ensure that your hard drive is functioning optimally. Therefore, you should get into the habit of regularly cleaning up your PC. The tools you need are provided with Windows: use ScanDisk, defragmentation, and disk cleaning to ensure everything runs smoothly. This will greatly increase the chances that current games will run smoothly on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage of being more efficient, which means that other applications you use will also run faster and more reliably. Consult the Windows help files to learn about the tools ScanDisk or Error Checking, defragmentation, and disk cleaning. Using the Windows help files
1. Click the "Start" button and select the "Help" (or "Help and Support") option to call up the Windows Help. 2. Now click into the search field and enter the corresponding keyword, e.g. "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Troubleshooting" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation" and "Disk Cleanup". You will then receive instructions explaining how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should ensure that you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent the game from crashing or hanging. - First, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the graphics card manufacturer. Here are the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS ON DRIVING ABILITY
My desire to develop video games was sparked by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and presented itself to me as a new means of expression that could push the world to its limits. It felt to me like I was a pioneer cinematographer at the beginning of the 20th century: On the one hand, I struggled with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still a lot to discover - especially a new language that was both narrative and visual. To be honest, the next ten years wouldn't have been enough to satisfy my hunger. I had the vague feeling that video games were only scratching the surface of their amazing creative potential, because they were too focused on "action" and were neglecting a fundamental aspect of the human experience: emotions. Meanwhile, technology was still advancing at a rapid pace. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true, emotionally expressive medium. I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you have been somewhat skeptical about video games in the past, I hope that Fahrenheit will change your mind. The interactive medium is still in its infancy, and there is still a lot to discover. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has occupied a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable intellectual and human adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, during which we were constantly forced to question many of the previously unquestioned principles. I would be happy if Fahrenheit - just like books, movies, and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also leaves its mark on you. David Cage

SERVICE MANUAL QIX
Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (with a minimum credit of 2) for 2 players. The aim is to get as much area as possible without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game is set up so that a minimum area must be occupied before the next area (round) can be attacked. The moving SPARX are shown in the upper part of the screen by red timing lines. When the timing lines cross, additional SPARX are released. When the alarm sounds, the SPARX become more aggressive and turn into SUPER-SPARX. While you are trying to draw your area, if your marking sign enters the death spiral, it is destroyed because you cannot cross your own path or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse is lit and your marking sign is destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At slow drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the four programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is capable of self-checking, providing data, and demonstrating that circuits and controls work properly. For more information, see "Service Program." The volume can be adjusted on the volume knob (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.
Programming and Test Switch: SUB-TEST

Programming and Test Switch: Up
Function: Restore to factory settings (until the sign glows green), increment by 1 step (when the sign glows green), programming and test switch: Down
Function: Countdown by 1 step
It is possible to install a coin counter into the device. A connection to a 412 V DC supply. A connection to J15-13 on the ROM/IC board.
SERVICE PROGRAM
Generally, the - in-device - 4 switches, the self-test button, and the LEDs on the video PC board are used for programming and testing.
Programming display. With this display, the language (English, French, Spanish, German) in which the address programming and the game operate is selected. The "Sub-Test" switch can be used to select the desired language, which appears green. The "Test" switch can then be used to switch to the next programming display. Game difficulty setting. With this display, the difficulty level for the game can be set. In addition, a "maximum number of credits" can be set, which is the number of credits that can be in the machine at the start of the game. The desired text is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch, which appears green, and the "Up" or "Down" switch is used to program the desired value. By repeatedly pressing the "Sub-Test" switch, the factory/default setting can be reached if the bottom line (RESET line) is green. The values are reset, and the pointer (as the green lines are called) jumps to the first line. Further programming can then be done. "Back" [Reserve High Score Value x 10,000] is used to transfer the high score value to the next programming display. This value determines the number of points/hits required for a player's initials and the high score value to be displayed on the screen. The "maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the machine. If this limit is exceeded, if a coin acceptance lock is present, the coin acceptance is locked. This allows a limited number of games for a player to be set. This value is from 1 to 99. It should not be set too close to 99, so that if more than 99 is added, the credits do not go to zero when a coin is inserted. A free play mode can be selected by setting "maximum number of credits" to O. Further programming: "Number of games": Number of marks per credit
"Threshold": The percentage number that must be reached to switch to the next round
"Time limit": Release for additional Sparx savings
"Difficulty": Difficulty level of the gameplay
"Attractton": no sound at "0" when in standby mode
"1" tone also in standby mode (animation tone) "table model": "0" standby device
at "1" table device
The credits per coin are set on the "Coin Insert Programming" display. The High Score Program display (highest hit rate so far) shows the hit points and initials of the player, including the next 10 hit point numbers. These values are used to set the high score selected on the previous display (set to "back"). Pressing the "Up" button sets the initials QIX standard. Pressing the "Test" button brings up the next program display. The "Summary" display. Pressing the "Up" button sets the value to 0. The following values are recorded: Total credits: The number of paid credits. The total does not reset to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts over. The total can only appear as 0 when the battery or W1 connection is removed, with the device turned off. Left coins: The number of coins inserted into the left coin slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right coins: The number of coins inserted into the right coin slot. Paid credits: The number of credits given for inserted (converted) coins. Granted credits: The number of credits given by the machine. % Free Spins: Granted credits (paid + granted credits per 100) Played minutes: The number of minutes played. Won minutes: The number of minutes extended or won. % Free Time: Won minutes/played minutes per 100. Average game time in seconds: Won minutes/paid + granted credits
High Score (Hit Rate): The number of players who had a high enough hit rate to displace other players from the high score list. Pressing the "Up" button resets the values to 0. Pressing the "Test" button displays the next program screen.
Coin slot programming/normal coin setting. With the help of this display, the vending machine operator can select a standard coin setting or program another setting
If a default setting is specified, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons, while the top digit lights green on the screen. The values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" button, the setting is adopted. If a setting other than the default setting is desired, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. Once pressed, the upper setting number is reset to 0, which means that a custom setting is possible. Since the lower values remain unchanged, the programmer can reduce his setting efforts by selecting a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that are not appropriate. Once the setting is complete, any new value can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. If the setting is accidentally activated, the default setting appears. By pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons, the values can be increased or decreased. By pressing the "Test" button, the process is completed. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") indicates how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through a corresponding slot. Coin units - "credit" indicates the number of units required before a credit is issued. "Bonus" coin units indicate the number of units required before a bonus credit is issued. "Minimum coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a predetermined minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value is not used. CMOS MEMORY (memory) FAILURE
If the "Memory Failure - Service Required" message appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, where all the programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to the factory default settings. This state probably indicates a failure or error with the battery.
ERROR SEARCH and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" or "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. Tests and settings can be entered to the respective program display by pressing the "Test" button, which then displays the next program. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the Self-Test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in the Auto-Test mode. In this program, the device will continuously perform the hardware test until it is turned off. When the "Open Coin Door to Test" (Münztür zum Prüfen öffnen) display appears, the J 19, 1 - 2 plug must be inserted. Without the J 19 plug, the memory (memory) is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it to the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the incorrect checksum appears on the LEDs. If the ROM checksum is faulty, U 10 is first displayed. If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as a series of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing a predetermined sequence of numbers in RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the Gerdt is holding the display mentioned above, a fault has been detected. If the Communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the fault may be caused by a faulty wiring (RAM) or a fault in the data board. To locate the fault, remove the data board from P6 and repeat the test. Failure means: a fault in U3, U4 or associated circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are reset to their previous values. LED value: 00 0011 If the device is holding the above-mentioned display, a fault is present. In this case, check U85 and U86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Video-board color RAM is checked by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These number sequences are checked for accuracy when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U56, U57, and associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video Board (RAM Display). The RAM display is checked by writing a pattern on each side. The results of the writing are compared to the original pattern. Any discrepancies cause the program to stop and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a RAM fails, the problem is detected and the RAM is replaced. If the RAM check does not indicate a failure (00 0101 on the LEDs), it is indicated that the next check will begin (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately, disappointing
The jacket arrived after two days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for Star No. 1. Star No. 2 is for the fact that the right jacket arrived without any visible seam defects. BUT I probably got too excited about the jacket, because the disappointment was all the greater. I had oriented myself by the other reviews and ordered the jacket in size L, as it is supposed to be quite tight-fitting. I didn't want to fight with my bust size to get into an S or M. In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and at the waist, but everywhere else it was a disaster. The lining material was already present when I opened the package and spread everywhere. It's just a shame... The jacket will be returned.
Fast delivery and good quality
The jacket looks great. We were surprised by the good quality. It can be worn on both sides. We ordered it for our daughter and she is totally thrilled. She normally wears size 158 and the 36 fits her quite well and will certainly be worn for another year as well. We can recommend ordering it.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad C because I always work with wood on the jack lift and that is not optimal. Unfortunately, I made a mistake and the pad does not fit quite right. But that is my fault. I then slightly modified it so that it fits. The pad looks very robust and does not damage the edges anymore. You can use the nut or the whole surface. It worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy it again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself is fine, but not before a year. The chewing area is too big for the small mouth. We bought it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it due to its size. Now, at 12 months, we've taken it out again and he can use it. It hasn't caused any problems with biting with his few existing teeth either. And when it was in the fridge, it calmed him down a lot.
Quality not good enough / Unfortunately, going downhill
I must have been blinded by the sometimes overly enthusiastic reviews here. I would like to preface this by saying that I already have two Lowepro backpacks in use. One is a very large one for storing equipment and the other is a fairly small one for carrying the most important, everyday items that you just need to have with you. Since I recently bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro backpack has become too small for me and I need a replacement. I bought this backpack during the Prime Day at a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR), and I was actually quite happy about the purchase, having read many of the reviews beforehand. When the backpack arrived yesterday, however, I was disappointed: For under 30 EUR, it is not a bad backpack, but that's as far as it goes. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer the same level of protection as my Lowepro backpacks. The compartments for small items are also of a different caliber, being much looser. Overall, the feel of this backpack is not comparable to that of my Lowepro backpacks. Also, the zippers and the materials of the pockets for small items are not particularly high quality. Therefore, I have decided to return the backpack. If someone does not want to spend a lot of money, this backpack is probably a good choice for them, but it is not for me. As soon as I unpacked the backpack, I knew after just two minutes that it was going back. What I did like about the backpack was the color inside. It is definitely easier to find things in there than in a grey interior. For someone who has different requirements for a backpack, this backpack is probably a great choice, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far, the electrical series by E. L. Todd has been my favorite, but this book changed my opinion. The first two books were very strong and also recommendable, and I was really looking forward to the third one. In this part, it's all about Volt and Taylor's feelings, and I thought it was dragged out unnecessarily. Taylor has been swooning over Volt for so long, finally admitting everything to him, and then acting like a little kid every time they argue?! There were also inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex that he was the one for her, and he didn't believe him when he said that Taylor stood by him and that he couldn't live without him. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series, and I think that this part is the weakest and also the most unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out that Taylor's friend Sarah is Volt's ex-girlfriend, which would add more tension to the story.
Humans destroy everything, don't appreciate it, and don't learn from it! First of all: The film isn't really that bad, as many people write. Of course, the story is totally contrived, and it follows the same old formula over and over again. Once you've seen the beginning, you know how the ending will be. And the message is always the same: Humans destroy everything, and don't appreciate it, and don't learn from it! And that's exactly what the film is trying to tell us! How many times did I just think (even though I know it's just a film and the animals are computer-generated) "Oh my God, the poor animals, it often brings tears to my eyes." Jurassic World: The Fallen Kingdom is really well done. It's just a shame that humans don't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream film. We destroy things consistently, the environment and the animals, and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and the living things: Nowhere to be found. 4 stars because the film is well made, but it follows the same old formula, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. Still, it's good popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some people expect a film like 8 Mile here. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be one. This film is above all "French" - and it's also quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic, and makes you cry - if you let yourself get into it and don't expect anything from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Taste like Quench from the 90s, all about orange, but that doesn't matter. I took 5 packets every morning for 5 days: nothing has changed, but absolutely nothing at all. My waist circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately the diarrhea has persisted for a week even after I stopped taking it immediately. It is worth noting that only 2 stars (unfortunately, too late) were given for the smaller package size, while the larger one received a full 5 stars? That is very strange!
terrible smell and poor results! In October I dyed my blonde hair with an intense brown dye to a chocolate brown color. In February/March I used this hair color remover. I used the product twice. The first time I noticed immediately that it had a terrible smell! However, the results were not too bad, it came out a dark chestnut brown (slightly darker). As I did not achieve my desired result, I used it, as instructed, even if the results were not satisfactory. I used it a second time and it was a complete waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked the same as after the first attempt. What was the worst of all was that the smell lingered for weeks after application, no matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away.
Highly Recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a longer period of time now, and always take one every 5 days. My vitamin intake has been low for a long time due to my work, lack of exercise, and an additional long-term illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only with a healthy diet, but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This works very well. I feel fitter and much better overall. I sleep better and get up more easily in the morning. The price is also great, as one also has to consider how long one can take the tablets. It is absolutely recommended.
Function not entirely flawless!!! After three months of using the battery case, I discovered the following major defects, which I find very annoying: 1) The case has problems connecting to the phone over time. This means that it no longer charges even though the "Power On/Off" button has been pressed for three seconds. When the phone is removed and reinserted into the case, the problem is usually solved in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinsertion of the phone into the case, the lid is now so worn that it detaches from the case on its own, so I've almost lost it several times. That's not many major defects, but I think that a case with a battery should function flawlessly in its function, so I'm very disappointed with the product, especially since I've only been using it for three months and it costs 30 euros.
Too expensive, too thin, and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews come about. Ultimately, it's actually just a lens cleaning cloth that you get as a gift from an optician in a slightly smaller version. The cleaning effect is just as good as that of a kitchen towel and no better. I had expected much more from these cloths; they are also very, very thin. Since I have used it, I am unfortunately no longer able to exchange it; I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side. The price for these cloths is way overpriced; you shouldn't pay more than 2 euros for them.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower as my smaller free speaker, which I received as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke. In general, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (it won't fall into the shower with me), reproduces bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course, you have to water the suction cup, otherwise it will come loose... It can reproduce sound very loudly... Yes, what I see critically is the frequency response of this little speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others are barely audible. While some frequencies of the voice are almost painful in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just about audible. My old speaker didn't reproduce bass very well, but the frequencies were reproduced at a fairly natural volume. Unfortunately, the Onforu doesn't really do that, which I find a bit annoying. Therefore, I have to deduct a star from the frequency response. I was expecting more from the frequency response.
very bad
In a few places, the color had chipped off and if you just walked over it with your hand, the color came off at those places too. We wanted to have it picked up for free because we didn't want it anymore, but unfortunately it was only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts, but what if both the commodes were damaged? Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon took care of everything for us and refunded our money. A big thank you to Amazon!
Better to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. The product consists of individual parts that you have to glue together yourself. It was packaged in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no additional protection. The postman stuffed the product into my mailbox almost violently, damaging a few of the stencils. I didn't complain, as I urgently needed this product. The adhesive included with the product barely holds, but does stick well - like chewing gum that doesn't harden. Already one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden sticks. Since the adhesive material doesn't dry out (at least not within five days after gluing), you have to be very careful not to glue everything together. The stencils are partially incomplete. For a one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's ok, but for a wedding I would invest more money and go for a high-quality product.
I am not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even though the instructions are not very user-friendly. + Magnetic closures + nice design + sturdy when assembled + shelf can be positioned anywhere
- Doors slam due to magnets (which can perhaps be compensated for with rubber bumpers) - some rough spots
- the screws that come with it are much too small and wobble (I had no others and didn't have any glue in the house, so I stuck them down with craft glue) - the shelf supports wobble a bit (I wrapped some paper around them and balanced them out) Conclusion: If he didn't look so good and didn't have such good measurements, I would give him fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. Also, I think he's a bit too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes good... but
... there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion, the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). Therefore, I would have given 5 stars. Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) also means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer will change this soon and earn a full score.
Set an alarm for me
The alarm clock came quickly and it was easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sounded terrible and extremely loud. I couldn't make them any quieter either. Apparently, that's possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, as I immediately fell out of bed. On top of that, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock because I thought it was already morning. When it was finally time for the sunrise simulation, however, it was too bright for me. I couldn't dim the colourful light either. I did like the colours and the colour change, though. Unfortunately, you can't dim the colourful light. I also liked that it has a battery so that you don't have to re-enter the time and the alarm setting in case of a power outage. However, I returned it for the reasons mentioned above.
Light is superb, but the processing is inadequate
I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, I'm now looking at a circuit board here... There was also nothing in the box. "6 pay - 4 receive" is not a good deal. Amazon would certainly have handled this in a generous and quick manner, but I only noticed it after the return period had expired. Therefore, I see this as my own fault and live with it. However, this is not a good indication of the quality of these light bulbs - so far, the only reason for deducting two stars. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit. The light color leans towards cool white. For hallways, workrooms, workshops, laundry rooms, etc., it's perfect. For living rooms, I would personally opt for warmer light. However, other lamps can also achieve this, and I might even receive intact ones according to my order. If my review is helpful, I would appreciate a positive rating. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I received gestures and I would like to share my first look. Yes, positive. I have long thought about whether to order this set or not. ** The material is stable and it feels good in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole at the handle for hanging them up ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use on pans with a coating. ** They are heat-resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. ** They do not conduct heat either, so they can be touched directly. ** The dishwasher sometimes leaves water marks on the black silicone, but a quick wipe gets rid of them. Finally, I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend it
B-stock sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping is simply top-notch. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, the tap unpacked and all parts checked. We discovered that the part had already been installed once. All mounting parts had significant scratches and abrasions. The connections/fittings for the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we notice scratches and streaks on the chrome tap itself. This part had probably already been delivered and then sent back. We will keep this tap and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter how it looks there. Our conclusion: we will never again order such goods from Amazon, but rather pay a little more in the hardware store where we get good quality goods. It's just sad that customers are treated this way!
The product itself is top-notch, but the external sensor unfortunately broke after just 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy to carry out, and the range is also very good, with no problems with the transmission from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only thing that is annoying is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. However, the thermometer still seems to be intact, as it still displays plausible values. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is clearly broken, as it always displays astronomically high values for the outside air humidity. This is very unfortunate, as the device was mounted outside in a protected location, and this was also the reason why I only gave it two stars.
Strong mower with weak catch basket
Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt, which is still going strong with Hermes today, has yet to find its way to me or back to Amazon, the Amazon service was, as always, excellent when triggering a replacement delivery. The lawnmower arrived quickly and made a good impression. The engine is powerful and the cutting results are beautiful. The noise level is not exactly impressively low, but it's ok. The major flaw, however, is the grass catcher. Firstly, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom, and the middle is made of fabric. If you set it down for even a short time when it is only half full, it will of course be compressed and parts of the contents will fall out. What is worse, however, is that the supposedly practical fill level indicator turns red when the grass catcher is only half full. That would not be so bad if the lawnmower did not then lose large parts of the cut grass from then on. So I have cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: In principle, it is a very good lawnmower, but the unfortunate design of the grass catcher makes it unusable for me.
Good equipment for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device is easily integrated into the app. The supplied detachable sensor cable is very good and can be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. The room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only once to three times a day (adjustable in the app) to save the battery. I give it only four stars for the following reasons. - The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can be closed only with some fumbling. - One of the two devices is in a room with fairly thick walls. This device loses the network connection about once or twice a week. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to remove the batteries and wait a short time before putting them back in, and then the device reconnects. Ideally, this should work without removing the batteries. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be a bit louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have still not managed to level the hotbed correctly to this day. The right rear locking screw is fully tightened, but the hotbed is still too high at the back and on the right side, the screw almost falls out because it is not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the carriage in place are straight and the table is also level. Perhaps someone knows what can be done about this, because it is impossible to print anything like this. As for the assembly: The assembly was fairly straightforward, but it would have been helpful to show how the cables should be routed, because otherwise they have to be re-routed several times, which is very tiring. I have also written to the support team, but after a week I still haven't received a reply. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to return the printer. I expected more.
robust and precise, I am pleasantly surprised
My old measuring ruler has unfortunately given up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to be acquired. This one gives a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. It comes with two batteries, so you can start using it right away. The ruler's packaging is simple but fulfills its purpose completely. Otherwise, the ruler leaves no wishes unfulfilled and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it full marks and believe it will last at least as long as the old ruler. I give it a clear buy recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent odor
I bought the bracelet but didn't wear it for the time being because it emits a disgusting smell. To this day, the smell has not gone away, even though it has been "aired" constantly. After it was no longer possible to return it, I disposed of it. I advise against buying it.
For the price, it's ok
The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too large for my taste, so it looks quite chunky. The larger balls are free-moving, which I think is quite nice. However, the chain as a whole is quite simply made, so I have already torn the closure open twice. So far I have always been able to repair it, but I don't think it will last long. However, for the low price you can't really expect anything really high-quality.
A very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually works! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it won't open, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care to make it even softer and more pliable. But: if you have anything magnetic on your arm, the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, junk! I was already disappointed after unpacking, as all the small displays of the transmitters were scratched, giving me the impression that they were used goods. The base station was in order. Now for the function: It only connects after some fiddling... and it doesn't work at all if you don't follow the instructions. Only after I removed a battery from the base station and reinserted it did the transmitters finally connect. Unfortunately, my joy didn't last long, as the connection was gone again after just one hour, even though the transmitters were lying right next to the base station. The display of the three transmitters was also very different! Overall, not something I could use. The thing went back! I would advise against buying it, as it only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, this garden pump is not new to me, unfortunately, after 3.5 years the thread of the inner shaft had rusted away. I bought it again only for one reason, I urgently needed it due to the current drought and I knew that the connections of the suction pipe and the discharge pipe would fit. I hope that the shaft of the previous pump was a production defect and that this pump will last a little longer in service. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the air vents broken. The cardboard box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump more carefully in the future, rather than just using a thin-walled cardboard box. I kept the pump anyway, as described above, because I urgently needed it and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump's performance.
It could have been better thought out. As I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought that such an organizer would be more pleasant than always having to carry around a huge keyring. At first, everything went quite well. However, the paint quickly wore off and the screws always had to be tightened. It's nice that this can also be done with a one-cent coin, but only with a one-cent coin. I couldn't find a suitable screwdriver that didn't immediately ruin the whole screw. To make matters worse, the most annoying part of the whole thing is attaching the keys. It's nice that the various parts allow you to adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths, but once you've screwed it all together, you need a pair of pliers to take it all apart again. Attaching the keys is a patience, balance, and dexterity game. In the end, the screw broke off in the thread when I was reassembling it for the third time, rendering the whole thing useless. Conclusion: If at all, then only once with all the necessary keys, but at that price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite match the specified dimensions
The zippers are smooth and the material seems robust, and it's all very lightweight. Since I have no comparison (it's my first organizer set), I won't be able to evaluate the product properly until after the first use. In the meantime, I can already say that the height is lower than indicated. I can't really imagine packing everything there for a three-week vacation right now. In a pinch, the really large items can still be packed directly into the suitcase, just as before. It's worth noting that 10, not 8, pieces were delivered, as two smaller bags/pouches were also included in the round cosmetic bag. They are not very well made, but I still wanted to mention it. The cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of a different material than the other bags, which doesn't bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's okay.
So lala
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't work anymore. Battery? Replaced. But it still doesn't work. So, I could have just thrown the money in the trash.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but one should be very careful when using the brush to avoid damaging the needle. I could not hear any improvement in sound quality with my very high-end turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. There were two black cables included. The battery life is very long. The sound quality is definitely more than adequate. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wear and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are very soft and pleasant to wear. The weight is also kept to a minimum. A purchase recommendation in this price range.
nice dress
A very nice dress that is very wearable for a variety of occasions. The price-performance ratio is spot on here, especially since I also bought it in the flash sale. It fits perfectly in my size, and I'm glad I didn't order it in a smaller size (as recommended). I only wish that the neckline wasn't so deep, and that the sleeves could handle a bit more fabric (if you don't have such slender upper arms like the model in the picture). Overall, a stylish dress for many occasions.
Stay away. It can't get any worse. I really didn't expect that such a piece of junk would be sold today. The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVDs usually work fine, but Blu-rays are only recognized at best unreliably. The discs have to be inserted multiple times before they are recognized. After that, the drive makes rattling noises like you haven't heard since the 1990s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes, you can either restart the computer because it won't work anymore or the disc will finally be recognized. But under no circumstances should you press pause or skip to a chapter or change the language or do anything else. This immediately leads to a non-recoverable freeze. Furthermore, no Blu-ray software is included. If you want to use PowerDVD or similar paid software, the price of this drive doubles.
It does what it's supposed to do, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are basically a gimmick, because only the port facing upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only for charging various devices and is therefore rather useless. I didn't know that at the time of purchase, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port, and if I had just needed a simple extension cable, I wouldn't have bought this ugly lump with golden plugs. But from the aesthetic point of view and my misjudgment, the extension cable does its job very reliably. And thanks to the weight of the plug, the USB stick doesn't just dangle around in the air like a normal extension cord. So it's not really a bad purchase, but my enthusiasm is limited :-).
Small but mighty! I bought this product so that I could have an audio output on my iPad (Pro) as well as a display connection. With IOS 12, it is now possible to transfer data back and forth. This works very well. The audio output was also as expected. Other adapters that I also had to return unfortunately could not do this. The HDMI output is also very practical. I now have a PS4 controller connected to my tablet via Bluetooth and the HDMI connected to the TV. Simultaneous charging is not a problem. The audio is delivered via HDMI. For what else do I need my PlayStation? A small adapter was included which can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to provide stability and has a magnetic holder. With my case, this doesn't work with the adapter, but it does hold securely and makes contact anyway... All in all, it is a bit expensive, but justified by the full functionality. It is also very small and made of aluminum, which makes it very stable. The price-performance ratio is just right.
A lot of performance
Top device. It has been running without problems for months. It is not exactly light or quiet, but it delivers good performance. I find the middle temperature setting (Tp setting) to be a bit too cool, so I am always on level 2. It has also survived several falls onto the tiled floor quite well. And I also like the simple design. Competitor products often look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large and does not give a cheap impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months now and are pleasantly surprised by the accuracy of the location tracking in live mode, which feels like it is within 0.5 m. However, in offline mode, when the dog is indoors, it sometimes jumps around by a few meters, which is not disturbing. I would buy it again at any time. What would be super would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently, it lasts about 1.5 hours a day. It would be great if there was a solution that could last 7-14 days. There is an XL version, but unfortunately, it is too big for our taste. As long as the battery lasts, we don't have to change it every day, which we find impractical. We should be spending time with the dog, not with its collar :-) The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered several pairs in different sizes. They fit well and seem to be comfortable as well. However, the lifespan is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears them in physical education class, the soles wear out after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. The last pair was also like this in normal use; they didn't last very long, but I thought they would be sufficient for the classroom. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. These shoes are expensive rubbish and are absolutely not recommended.
Perfect fit - but original? My last pair of Crocs lasted five years, unfortunately, and then broke, so I happily ordered a new pair. These ones, however, seem to be poorly made at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, there doesn't seem to be any difference, but on closer inspection, it's clear that the edges are poorly finished and the strap at the heel is quite loose and will probably not last as long as my previous ones, which lasted for five years. I'm looking forward to it!
Surprisingly good
As there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was initially quite sceptical. However, as I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I decided to order them on a whim. The package included a mattress and an air pump. The mattress came with a mattress cover and a sheet. Regarding the mattress: I tried it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) and noticed that there was some mould on one side. I wiped it away and hope that it doesn't reappear. When the mattress was inflated, a comfort test was carried out. It was comfortable to lie on and was perfect for the festival. Of course, this mattress can't replace your own bed, but for a few days at the event, it's pure luxury. The mattress fits perfectly in my car. Beforehand, we removed the seats in the back. The mattress fits perfectly. The air pump comes with various adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the cigarette lighter in the car. However, the plug was defective (something about the soldering). As my boyfriend is handy, he was able to repair it and reassemble it, and it worked perfectly, pumping up the mattress in no time at all. Overall, I am very impressed with the mattress. I am looking forward to the test at the festival. I hope that it doesn't lose air and that it lasts for a long time. I will update the review if I have any other experiences (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, I only give this calendar two stars. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar was torn open over several doors on the first day due to its shoddy construction. By the 21st door, there were no doors left at all and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the rest of the pieces since they were basically already falling out for him. The pieces often come out in a jumble, which often means that you have to reassemble the car in order to put them in place. During play, pieces fall off. (Most often the windshield. This is also very difficult to reattach.) In principle, I would not buy this calendar again and would not recommend it to anyone else. Perhaps the manufacturers will reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and make it better. :\
a real drone
I am impressed by the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies it. It flies very well indoors and the 5-minute flight time is usually more than enough. I did not expect the hair to get stuck in it or for the drone to break very quickly at that price, but crashes from the ceiling to the floor, whether on tiles or carpet, are no problem. Friendly contact if you have any questions.
The game is OK but it can only be played through Steam by force. I didn't notice when I bought it that it wasn't a game CD but just a code to download the game, which is fine as far as that goes, but one is forced to install Steam in order to play it at all, which is an outrage. Since then, the computer has been constantly crashing, which wouldn't happen with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery's runtime
I was really looking forward to the watch. The design and appearance are great, and the display shows messages and other information without any problems. The operation works well... and yet I'm sending it back. The big catch: the battery and its runtime. I charged it in the evening and left it on the shelf overnight, and in the morning it had lost 11% of its charge when not in use. If you get a lot of messages during the day, the battery is gone by midday/early afternoon, and then you can't even read the time. So, for me, it's not usable. That's a real shame.
Luxurious shell with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, you should definitely get a case. I recently liked cases where you can also insert a credit card. This case offers that. If you put cards in all three slots, it's too much, then the lid stands up a bit. One is enough for me. The leather case gives a robust impression and seems to be well made. It looks elegant. Unlike many other cases, the phone is encased all the way around, except for the connections, where there are cut-outs. You can easily operate the on/off button and volume control on the sides through the case. A disadvantage is that on some QI charging pads, it is not possible to charge the phone through the thickness of the case. Even the QI charging pad made of leather by TORRO doesn't work. You can only charge accessories such as the Galaxy Buds when the case is off. Otherwise, it's really nice and well made!
high-quality case with a protective glass film
The robust case with real bulletproof glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers comprehensive protection for the entire iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily put on. The material is pleasant to the touch and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some stability. It is not too bulky and sits firmly on the phone. Overall, a good purchase.
