Shout to the world
The marketing campaign "Looks Like You Need Iceland" seems to have gotten off to a good start, and its calls and cries out in nature are beginning to draw people from all around the world.
"You have the puzzle, I need Iceland," says a woman from the outside world in response to the advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another spectator said they will keep Iceland in their heart forever and a young woman said she will go to Iceland as soon as possible since her beloved is living there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States and therefore it is expected that we will have to wait for another month.
An audience member asks if the journey to Iceland is feasible, since there are no planes.
He does not follow the story whether he comes from another time period.
Egill Þórðarson from the advertising agency Peel, who created the advertisements in collaboration with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the reception has been better than expected.
I have been on many Inspired By Iceland trips that have gone very well, but this new trip is already surpassing them.
This is about creating PR value, which is getting foreign media to talk about the tour, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in around seven hundred media outlets around the world, which together reach approximately two billion people.
The value of that discussion is valued at 1.8 billion krona.
That's not weird.
The main market is the United States and the tour has gone very well there even though Americans are not traveling to the country in haste.
According to Egil, markets such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also taken well to themselves, as has Russia, which came as a pleasant surprise.
Then responses have come from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically planned for.
Egill says, "These ads have traveled further than we expected, as over four million people have watched the content on YouTube."
We couldn't have asked for a better start.
Photos at this opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, a photographer from Morgunblaðið, for advertisements bearing the headline "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The pumpkins went far and wide, such as on Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík, at Reynisfjara, by Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökull and in the cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions and the cinematographer was Óttar Guðnason.
In the roles of the lead characters were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
Icelandic people came to make the commercials, but at the same time while filming was taking place in the South, another group was in the West and Westfjords.
According to Egil, "Let It Out" is only the first step in the Looks Like You Need Iceland journey, with plans for a winter journey in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
Egill says, "This is just the first phase of this project for the Icelandic Agency," and adds that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone exceptionally well.
It is great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking about.
English: Discuss the state of the labor market, pension fund, and much more.
Minister of Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, will attend the meeting at Sprengisand starting at ten o'clock today at Bylgja.
He is also the Minister of Employment and oversees the situation in the labor market, the Icelandair issue, and other matters.
He also manages rural affairs and transportation services in rural areas that have been struggling and controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, the former chairman of VR, will also be featured in the program and he will discuss his criticism of pension fund investments and present ideas for labor unions and businesses to withdraw from the funds' boards to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
English:
They will look ahead to the autumn and ponder whether the success of the summer is a foreboding of what is to come.
Listen to the program below, starting at ten o'clock.
She looks like this today 25 years ago.
Elisa Donovan had a successful career in various teen shows.
She gained fame for her role as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in the series Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
She hasn't done much lately, but she was able to look back on her past and talk about Clueless on an Australian TV show recently.
She speaks fondly of Brittany Murphy who unexpectedly passed away in 2009 and says she was a wonderful person.
I have to admit that I based the character mostly on girls I encountered in school who were not kind to me.
"As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan said about his role in Clueless.
I didn't leave the police station after my overnight stay.
Ninety officers of the police force in the capital region came to the table today and the police logbook states that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to deal with a man who had recently been released from prison after serving time for a DUI.
The wild man did not leave after he was released and did not obey the police orders telling him to go away.
The man stayed at the police station for an extended period of time due to his progress.
A man was arrested this morning suspected of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to take action against two people in Breiðholt due to a report of physical assault.
Then it happened that a woman who was eating at a cafeteria in Kópavogur could not pay for her bill after the meal and was thus called to the police.
It was also announced that a car was stolen in the city center yesterday.
A white Renault van driver was looking for it for a while and then it was taken without permission.
The bill has not been found.
The Curse of the Joybringer - The Terrible Fate of the Glitterstars
A rumor has been circulating on the internet that the cast of Glee is cursed, as actress Naya Rivera recently drowned in California, making her the third main cast member to pass away before their time.
The shows about the Glee club (e.g. Glee) are a popular series about singing, dancing, and joy.
The series revolved around a group of teenagers in a high school, their loves and destinies.
It wasn't always easy to be in the joyous group, but through singing and dancing the characters seemed to be able to overcome whatever circumstances arose in their lives.
Without a safe haven, the players and staff of the show have suffered great losses, so much so that rumors have arisen that a curse lies upon the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the show, Glee, which didn't always call her grandmother.
After the series had run its course, Rivera went on to marry actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they subsequently separated.
Dorsey declined to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8th of last year, it was announced that River was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life vest on board the boat and he was able to tell the police that he and his mother had jumped overboard and then Rivera had brought him back up into the boat but had never returned himself.
A large-scale search for Rivera has been initiated.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area concluded that the search was based on the assumption that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.
She is said to have been caught in a strong current in the water and used her last strength to save her son.
Data from accidents involving drunk drivers was recorded.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American football player with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Glee Club to fame and respect.
Without the parts, Moneith still dealt with personal devils.
Since the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape from it.
In 2013, his collaborators found enough evidence, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and it seemed like everything was looking up.
Only two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein mixed a pleasant drink from spices and alcohol.
It was not considered to be a case of voluntary action.
Moneith had gone through treatment and his tolerance for drugs had decreased so much that even small amounts he had previously tolerated well, proved to be dangerous.
He was only 31 years old when he took his own life.
His passing weighed heavily on his co-stars, but in support of his co-star Lea Michele, it was decided to continue shooting the episodes and dedicate them to the memory of Monteith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the show. Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow glee club members, until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years ago, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles suspected of trafficking child pornography.
We found an extraordinary amount of children's toys during a search of his home, and the news quickly spread publicly.
It was clear that Salling had been finished.
Hann was subsequently charged and convicted for his crimes.
He was sentenced to four to seven years in prison, as well as having to be registered as a sex offender and seek treatment for pedophilia.
Before the judge had imposed the sentence, Salling, who was then released on bail, was found near his home.
Danarosk was suicide.
Not only the players of the show fell far behind in age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the episodes.
Hann dó bráðlega í svefni árið 2013, aðeins 41 ára gamall.
A woman named Nancy Motes also won the contest.
She was the younger sister of the big star Julia Roberts and did not carry her sister's beautiful story, but she blamed Roberts for her great control and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014 but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter for her beloved in which she credited her mother and sister among others for how she had come to be.
My mother and my so-called siblings will not receive anything from me except the memory that it was them who endured all my worst depression.
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her power and influence to take control of the situation and be overly authoritative.
Jesse Luken had a guest starring role in the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a serious offense.
Heather Morris had a big role in the series.
She became a victim in 2010 when hackers gained access to her nude photos and posted them on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and had a relationship outside of the show.
Benoist later admitted that Jenner had used violence against her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
Children's maturity increases when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents to cultivate flowers and watch them grow and bloom.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Having a moment with the children in the garden is something that is never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the air, and of course that precious time they had with their parents.
Buy a boat after the tenth bank.
"We are not many sailors who work in kindergartens in the country," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who goes fishing in the summer and studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.
Fishing trips are a very convenient summer job when one is in school.
If I fish, I can have good earnings and I think it's great to be able to avoid taking out student loans.
"Tekjurnar are just as good for me in the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student who goes fishing in the summer, just like the summers before.
Axel was the newest arrival at the dock in Tálknafjörður when a reporter caught up with him late in the evening at the start of the week.
I took the boatmaster's license for boats under twelve meters long after I finished elementary school and I bought my boat the following summer.
I have been fishing in my boat every summer since then.
I bought the boat used from my friend, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after his name.
Hartmann had become an adult when I bought the boat and had stopped going to sea, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann bought the boat a few years after I took it over," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I was done fishing.
I owned the boat debt-free by the end of my first summer with it.
How could a guy have one and a half million to pay for a boat when he had just finished high school?
I had been saving up and putting away money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was fishing with him all summer and getting my share.
I put my savings into my boat fund.
Axel was born in Isafjordur, where all of his family is from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
I am fishing here on the west coast because I have a residence permit with my grandmother in Isafjordur.
I learned to row in this area here west of here with my dad.
I travel between fjords depending on how I feel, as this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Even though I prefer to be west of here, I have also explored around Snæfellsnes and further.
Axel says, "I have also given offerings to the south, mostly gray plover,” He always stirs up a fire early in the morning and sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, in his solitary moments together out on the beach.
The connection out at sea is good, so I can make calls, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't like being alone on a boat.
"Of course I try to avoid getting seasick, but occasionally something has been a bit rough, but never too dangerous," says Axel, who is lucky that he never gets seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the fishing goes each time.
English: I never stay out fishing for more than 14 hours in one go when I'm beach fishing, but I have also been fishing in other systems, such as the rental quota, where I have been continuously fishing for one and a half solar cycles out at sea.
The regulations for fishing in the sea state that he can catch 770 kilograms per day, which he finds satisfactory.
Other restrictions are that I cannot fish on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only fish twelve days a month, during these four months that the coastal fishing season is in effect, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days based on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to rush instead of having 48 days off throughout the summer and being able to choose for themselves.
"The redistribution of fishing grounds should be done in my favor, and fishing grounds that are well situated near fishing grounds should be able to benefit from it," says Axel, who mostly catches cod from the open sea on his beach fishing trips, as well as occasionally some haddock and other species of fish.
Axel wins over the winter season with his college course at the Núpi daycare in Kópavogur.
"We are not many sailors who work in the kindergartens of the country," says Axel proudly and adds that he only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
I am excited because I think this job is amazing.
Axel, who is also far along in his studies of business, says, "I hope that my psychology studies will be useful to me in the future at the elementary school level."
The villa registration prevented the homecoming party.
A villa in the registration form that people fill out when they come to the country was created so that an individual, residing in the country, would not be called back for a re-examination.
There is no requirement to provide a social security number if the individual fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
The expert at the health department of the chief medical officer said, "This will be looked into this week."
Three domestic cases were confirmed at the Infectious Diseases Department of the National Hospital yesterday.
One of those who tested positive arrived in the country on July 15th, two days after the rules for the so-called homecoming test took effect.
Those who were settled in Iceland are then screened upon arrival to the country and again invited for a test four to five days later.
In the noon news on RÚV, it was reported that the person in question had followed the old system.
The inspection at the borders was negative and he was not called back for the inspection due to the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of the Directorate of Health, says in an interview with the news agency that this can be attributed to an error in the digital registration form.
English: Completing the registration form in English is not a requirement to enter a social security number as is required in the Icelandic version.
Primarily, it has been thought of for foreign tourists.
The person in question has not received an automatic invitation to attend the examination.
Kamilla says that they have followed the quarantine rules even though they filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been vigilant in sending people for testing again after they arrived in the country.
This will be looked at during the week to see how to make it easier for people to access this to draw attention to the process.
The man is in isolation and six have been put in quarantine.
They all went to the show, but two had already shown signs.
Contact tracing is now underway for the three cases that were identified yesterday, and it is mostly completed due to the two cases that were reported on Friday.
In both cases, Icelandic gene sequencing has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the other case, the suspects have been directed towards Israel even though it is known that the one who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be known tomorrow where the other wind is coming from.
There are now 15 in isolation according to the COVID.is website.
There are 135 people in quarantine.
Four out of five escapes are unrelated.
Five domestic cases have been reported in the country in the past few days.
Four of them are completely unrelated and, for example, the source of the infection that arose at the Rey Cup Sports Tournament yesterday has not yet been identified.
Smitrakning is a persistent problem.
Originally, thirty individuals were sent into quarantine, but this was reduced to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 infected due to these new cases that were identified yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that an infection has been detected at a sporting event, raising questions about whether such events should be held.
Johann K. Johannsson, the communications director of the National Police Commissioner's Department, says it is perfectly possible as long as people follow the guidelines and regulations.
We are constantly reminding all those who live here that individual protective measures must be maintained.
We also need to remind people who are hosting events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
Johann says, "It is then possible to hold an event."
He says it is possible to prevent infection by wearing individual protective equipment.
Rules and criteria should be subject to ongoing review.
What needs to be done, and what the Public Health Department and the National Board of Health are constantly emphasizing to people, is to adhere to these individual protective measures.
Both on-premises and likewise with service providers.
People should wash their hands and use hand sanitizer.
"It prevents the spread of infection," says Johann.
We need to encourage people to continue on the good path that we were on, in order to maintain the success we have achieved so far.
40% of COVID-19 patients had diabetes.
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father was having to breathe.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
He was let go the next day.
The deadline was extended due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The diabetes was specified on the death certificate as an underlying condition and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is afraid that he may not survive.
Reuters news agency says there is no unfounded fear of Brumfield.
Results of a new study conducted by US authorities show that approximately 40% of those who died had type 2 diabetes as an underlying condition.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion increases to half.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted an investigation of more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an epidemiologist at the CDC, says the results are striking, especially for those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
Reuters conducted a survey and the responses from the 12 countries that responded were similar in proportion.
Ten states, including California, Arizona, and Columbia, have not yet begun to distinguish between underlying diseases.
The skyr was already ripening at a slow pace.
Now that COVID-19 has broken out "like a powerful force of nature," according to Reuters, Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago, said.
Black and people of South American origin are more likely to suffer from poverty, which has also been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
A good defense for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in check with exercise, a healthy diet, and support from healthcare professionals.
The coronavirus outbreak has made it difficult for many to maintain their routine over the past week.
The high cost of insuline has caused some to continue to go to work and thus avoid being exposed to the virus.
Reuters reports that US authorities may have been aware of the risks posed by those with type 2 diabetes from the virus.
In 2003, when SARS coronavirus spread, approximately 20% of those infected with the virus were hospitalized. In the swine flu pandemic of 2009, this group was three times more likely to need to be hospitalized.
When MERS first emerged in 2012, a study showed that 60% of those who died or were hospitalized had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a researcher at Yale University, says that due to the impacts of the COVID-19 virus, the disruption could have uncovered a multitude of previously unknown side effects.
Andrew Bolton, the chairman of the International Diabetes Federation, says, "I fear that we will see a flood of problems when this is over."
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic could indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, such as diabetic neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy.
New research suggests that coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters reports that scientists are trying to understand the link between coronavirus and diabetes.
Veiran affects the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then a high ratio of glucose and lipids in diabetics can cause a real "counter-regulatory storm", as it is called when the immune system reacts too harshly and overwhelms the body.
Excessive intake of intake can also lead to clot formation which can again cause life-threatening blood loss.
Dela Cruz says, "This is all one big puzzle."
This is all connected.
The news has been corrected.
They were offered champagne, so they left the hotel.
Asrun Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason were presented with the unusual request from artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work he was putting up in Paris.
We love each other so this wasn't difficult.
Atli Bollason will never forget the first time he met his wife and mother of his children, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir.
I was very charmed by her.
It was naturally just an exaggeration, but it still seemed to me to be quite unbearably sweet.
He still thinks so," he says.
Ásrún likes this, and her husband regularly re-discovers the first one.
I always hear this story.
She says that she was just as nervous when she first met her husband last weekend.
I found and still find so much gossip around Atla, which I dislike.
There is a lot going on and a lot happening and I am excited about it.
Atli says that the couple has emphasized going their own way in their relationship.
We don't tie our horses with the same knots as our fellow travelers.
We create routines around us that we stick to.
It is possibly the reason why they took the commission from Ragnar Kjartanssyni, the painter, just enthusiastically, even though it was to say the least, unusual.
English: Our mutual friend Kristín Anna has contacted us and asked if we can join her, Ragga, and Ingibjörgu, Ragnar's wife, for dessert at Snaps.
They ordered drinks, met up at Snaps and got themselves a dessert wine and each their own dessert.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plans for an art exhibition he was planning to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
English: Hann had a multi-screen video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it in a simple way.
Ásrún says that he has described the work as a banal and decadent snapshot of the everyday life of Westerners.
English: Hann had sketches of all the scenes he intended to shoot and lastly he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in it.
Ragnar asked Senan and the couple to take part in a show to demonstrate young interracial couples in love in a minimalistic room.
Atli says, "These are journeys with a beginning and an end."
They didn't know Ragnar very well even though they had heard of him and he of them, "but they knew us and it seemed to fit."
They agreed that they did not want to advertise for people.
Maybe they were told that they wouldn't get the right people, but people who would get sexual gratification from performing for others.
They invited Ragnar and agreed to consider the matter, but it didn't take long.
When we ran out of Snaps, we said: Aren't we just in this for the fun?
This was just the way it was.
Ásrún says, "I trust Ragnar as a leader and all of his team," and Atli agrees.
This is about love and friendship.
Sean was taken up in a nice apartment on Myrargata Street.
There was a very small film crew; the cameraman, Ragnar, and the soundman and the pair.
After the recording had been started, everyone left the room to wait outside in the car except Atli and Asrun.
We had not decided on how we should be.
We got some small instructions but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
Ásrún says, "We didn't play, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Was this romantic?
Atli says, "This was kind of romantic," and Ásrún agrees.
We were offered a toast before they left the barracks.
It was kind of like being on a nice vacation in Paris.
The team was pleased with the performance of the pair in the task that moved them.
Atli says, "When Tommi the painter looked at this, he cried, it was so beautiful to him."
Ásrún says, "This is just as much about love and friendship as it is about the companions themselves."
Atli's parents have seen the work and Atli says his mother heard his voice in the exhibition at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realized he was part of the work.
Atli says, "Then she turns around and starts to ponder this."
Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone about this yet, but then my dad sent me a message saying, "It was great to run into the little family at the Palais de Tokyo," recalls Ásrún.
Does participation in the project deepen the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
We are still together anyway, so maybe we can deepen this a bit.
"This deepened my connection with my extended family," says Ásrún with a laugh.
Ásrún saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleagues.
She says, "I found it a bit difficult to be with someone else instead of you," and turns to her husband.
It was fun to see this because this is just one scene in a much bigger work and when you saw this with the other works it was very beautiful.
I managed to break away from this and was just proud.
Ásrún said, "And there was a little baby inside me, even though I was already ill from another baby of the couple when the pregnancy was discovered."
English: "That was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen hosted the show "Ástarsögur" on Rás 1 with Ásrún and Atli.
Swansea won their previous knockout match.
Swansea won 1-0 against Brentford in a dramatic match.
This was the first match of the teams in the playoffs to get promoted to the English Premier League.
The game took place at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The score at halftime was 0–0.
The home team in Swansea were awarded a penalty on the 64th minute and Andre Ayew blasted the ball off the penalty spot and managed to keep it away from the goalkeeper.
Only two minutes earlier, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, received a red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game with one man fewer and in the 82nd minute Swansea took advantage of their numerical superiority.
Andre Ayew lifted the spirits with a fantastic goal, securing a 1-0 win for Swansea.
Swansea leads 1-0 in the match, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
Sent without a lord for five years from the year 2009.
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported yesterday that he wanted to have an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
It has not been smooth sailing for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst left her post as the U.S. Ambassador in April 2009, the country has been without an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned from her position under special circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she was supposed to receive the Falcon Order.
On her way to a farewell party with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office informing her that she would not be honored with the award.
After she left Iceland, she taught International Relations at the Army War College.
Six months passed until Van Voorst's successor came into office in September 2010.
It can be partly attributed to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as an ambassador but then resigned.
Louis Ariega finally took the job, having worked in the foreign service for decades.
He left his job in the fall of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then began another period without an ambassador.
Robert Barber was confirmed by the US Congress in January 2015 and took office shortly thereafter, as there had been no ambassador in place for 13 months.
The barber was politically organized but not a diplomat, instead he had worked as a lawyer and a short-term election fund for Barack Obama.
Hann stepped down from his position as soon as Donald Trump took office as President on January 20th, 2017, as is customary for politically appointed ambassadors.
The Trump administration was unusually quick to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials to the government in Washington.
It took two years until the United States Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to their meeting to question him on the interrogations and confirm that he had completed his mission as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the assembly, he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, and his deceased wife had been of Dutch mountain descent.
Gunter is politically organized, was formerly a dermatologist in California and has been active in Jewish organizations in the Republican Party, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate, founded the organizations, and Adelson is a strong supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter arrived to work in Iceland in May 2019, but since early 2017, no ambassador had been in the country for two years and four months, which is the longest example here.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration was taking to appoint people to key positions, as well as the fact that in recent years the work of the US Congress has been drawn out significantly, including confirming ambassadors to posts.
Since 2009, Iceland has been without an ambassador for about five years.
This has not prevented the implementation of the embassy's initiatives which recently opened a headquarters at Engjateig.
The works have been estimated to have cost around 6.5 billion and thick security walls surround the building and bulletproof glass is in all the windows.
It seems that it has not been enough to secure the current ambassador, as he is said to fear for his life and has requested armed protection.
Former IBV player was subject to racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland."
Tony Mawejje, a former player of IBV, claims to have experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he still remembers coming to the country.
This is revealed in an interview with Tonny that was published in the Ugandan media outlet Daily Monitor.
Tony recently joined the team Uganda Police FC which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in the country when he played with IBV, Val and Thróttur in Iceland.
When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the midfield like I was used to.
The team captain was in that position, but he also had the jersey number I wanted, so I didn't get either of what I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right side during his time with IBV.
Among the things that Tonny speaks about is racism that he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
This once happened to me, but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
I then heard news about the language and then I asked my friend what the language was about.
Hann told me then that my opponent had made racist remarks about me after I tackled him.
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He says he has made the mistakes that he regrets the most.
Tony had not been able to make it into the starting lineup for Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to make it into the national team.
He then asked to go back to Iceland on loan and he then joined forces with Val.
It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
Tonny says, "I think if I had stayed longer in Norway, I would have gotten the opportunity I wanted. He was hoping that if he played well in Norway, he would likely get further."
He wants to suggest that the loan to Iceland has made his dreams of getting into a big team in Europe come true.
There is a lump in the woman's throat.
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black snake in the throat of a woman who had come there for treatment.
The doctor was able to pull the snake out with tongs.
Research revealed that it was a reptile.
CNN is reporting on this.
Konan had eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of raw meat, a few days before.
The mice returned quickly after the snake was removed, but reptiles like this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi gained popularity in the Western world, cases of people being infected by parasites have increased, according to CNN.
It is expected that another wave will start in Europe.
Spain is now in a state of emergency in response to concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, and authorities have taken measures to contain the spread of the virus anew.
In Catalonia, all leisure activities have been put on hold for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken measures due to the increase in infections in Spain, while in the UK everyone must go into quarantine upon returning from Spain, like in Norway, and the French have been warned against travelling to Spain.
English:
The situation in Europe is still good compared to other parts of the world, but new cases of infection worldwide are approaching 300 thousand per day, with the most cases in America and South Asia.
Confirmed cases of the virus have reached 16 million worldwide, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University, and deaths confirmed to be related to the virus have reached 644 thousand.
Mosaic work finally gets to enjoy itself to the fullest.
In front of the City Hall in Reykjavik is a large and deep hole.
People in her fan are wearing orange helmets.
There is also a big grave.
And more smaller machines for work.
The street is closed to traffic.
Once a staircase, it is now a gallery where many come to admire the mosaic artwork made of millions of tiles, as if they have never seen it before.
Maybe they have never seen it before.
At least not envision it for oneself.
The parking lot in front of it has been quite busy, always full of cars.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry and then left to attend to their business in the city center.
English: "Lively and diverse public spaces" and "attractive urban landscape" are guiding lights for the redevelopment of Tryggvagata which is now underway.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow Gerður Helgadóttir's mosaic artwork at the Tollhouse to be better appreciated.
The area where the work is being done will be a plaza, and since the area is well-suited to the sun, it is considered a suitable resting area for travelers.
The list will be illuminated and now the material will enjoy itself better than before on this 142 square meter floor.
In the area there will also be small "mist gardens", some kind of water sculptures, which offer play and give the area a certain charm.
Reykjavík City Council is described as taking part in the implementation of the renovations along with Veitum.
The water, heating, and electricity utilities will be renewed.
Their wells have come to their years, but the school district and cold water district have been from 1925 and have thus served the inhabitants and businesses in the city center for nearly a century.
When the street is reopened after the works are completed, cars can drive on it again.
She will still be unique and at the same time create calmer and more accessible spaces for pedestrians.
The website of the Customs Director states that the Customs House was put into use in 1971 and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Due to the harbor breeze passing through the house, 250 square meters of wall-to-wall carpeting was formed out to the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such additions would have a negative effect on the overall appearance of the house, unless special measures were taken to enhance the appearance of the house.
The parties agreed to arrange for the installation of a permanent artwork here.
At this time, much was said about Gerður Helgadóttir, an artist, according to the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic artworks in Germany and beyond.
It was advised to contact her first before deciding whether a competition for the job would be held.
English: It had often been discussed that the work should reflect life at the harbor, since the harbor had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was established.
When the artist was spoken to, she was deeply moved by such a work.
They had to come to an agreement that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður got the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home she put forward some proposals for discussion.
It was unanimously agreed to ask her to do the job.
It was also desired to make a total agreement with her and the famous artworks company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, as Gerður had long been working with them to set up famous artworks all over Europe.
Agreements were made and Gerður won the artwork under the setup of the workshop of the brothers, who then took care of the setup of the Customs House.
The entire project was exceptionally well handled, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and Oidtmann Brothers, according to the summary.
It has been since then that the unpleasant Icelandic weather has persisted.
It took Gerður about two years to complete the work, which was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
Two years after the Customs House was completed, only 47 years old.
Moving more foundations out to the countryside
Icelandic Minister of Social Affairs, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, announces that more public institutions will be moved out to the countryside in the near future.
The minister said this in the episode "Sprengisandi on the Wave" in the morning.
Recently, it was announced that the Housing and Employment Agency's dispute resolution department will be relocated to Sauðárkrók in the fall.
Sex psychologists specializing in trauma work for the organization, but none of them plan to follow the organization north and the National Association of Firefighters and Paramedics has criticized the relocation plans.
I think we need to take further steps in this direction.
I am preparing further steps in this venture.
Ásmundur said, "Frequent flights."
He suggests that a large majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
English: "I think we need to take further political decisions about moving public services out to the countryside, like I was doing with the Housing and Welfare Agency," said Ásmundur, and he also gave examples of other agencies that have been moved out to the countryside and made a big difference for communities out there, such as the relocation of the Food Agency to Selfoss, the Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes, and unemployment benefits to Skagaströnd.
The best of the last day of the Masters Tournament
The Icelandic National Championships in Freestyle Sports ended at Thorswell in Akureyri today.
Some matches were set on the later competition day.
There was an exciting competition in women's shot put at Thorswell and Vigdis Jonsdottir from FH set an Icelandic record in shot put in 2014 which stood until Elisabet Rut Runarsdottir from IR improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic Championship back earlier this summer and has been in great form since then, having tripled the Icelandic Championship score from last summer.
Elizabeth Rut has been struggling with injury and was unable to make it to practice today.
She only had one good throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the farthest of all today, 60.08 meters in her last attempt, setting a new record.
Her Icelandic record set in July was 62.69 meters, so she was still somewhat far from it.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day and she improved her best performance with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, FH-ingurinn Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Iceland's representative in the hammer throw, won a convincing victory as he threw 73.84 meters in his second-to-last throw and set a new record.
His Icelandic record in the event is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, an Olympic athlete and Icelandic representative in discus throwing, won a competition in shot put at Þórsvelli yesterday and today he competed in discus throwing which is his main event.
Iceland's Guðna Vals threw the farthest at 65.53 meters today and secured the victory with a throw of 59.13 meters.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second farthest today with a valid throw of 49.43 meters, good enough for second place.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Iceland's record holder in long jump, won the long jump competition with ease as Hafdís jumped 6.25 meters today which is just about 40 cm short of her own Icelandic record.
In the 200 meter women's run, it was Icelandic runner Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, finishing in 24.04 seconds, although her Icelandic record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was successful in Akureyri yesterday, winning two gold medals in the 100 meter dash and the 4 x 100 meter relay, and also in the 4 x 400 meter relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200 meter race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelsson from Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meter race yesterday as well as in the 400 meter race.
You won't be fined for a 27 million krona Bitcoin transaction.
The Tax Appeals Board has rejected the claim of the Tax Inspector who demanded a penalty against a person for underreporting their income derived from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
You came to the conclusion that the tax investigator had not provided clear evidence as to why it was necessary to prosecute the man.
The committee's ruling states that the tax investigator found the person to be in breach of incorrect tax declarations for the years 2016 and 2017.
Hans had unexpectedly accumulated profits from the sale of his Bitcoin up to 27 million, either intentionally or due to great negligence.
The sect honored the man for his loyalty.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
He agreed to have sold cryptocurrency for 27 million in 2016.
Hana had acquired him with a laptop in the years 2009 and 2010 when such had been both easy and inexpensive with a regular home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the tax implications of such a sale had been highly unclear and unpredictable.
It would have been impossible to expect that ordinary citizens would be aware of such regulations on tax returns.
He hadn't expected to get away with not paying tax on the profits and had declared his assets on the tax return as deposits in a bank account.
Hans had asked both experts and the tax collector how to handle this, but without success.
He then realized he had to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started mining for Bitcoin.
Hann væri i en enda verri stilling en andre for å forstå komplekse regler som skattefogden ikke hadde dannet seg en klar oppfatning av.
The man deemed it fair that his taxes for these two fiscal years would be recouped and a penalty applied, but otherwise no punishment would be imposed.
He then reiterated that he had been living in Iceland and had been paying taxes in the country since 2012.
English: Hans had never intended to escape his responsibilities in an irresponsible manner.
We would collect money from all sides and put him in debt.
Brynjólfur is making a name for himself: "This man knows what football is all about."
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been highly regarded amongst people, and has also gained admiration for his success in playing with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max division.
Sparks will fly in the pitch tonight when they take on IA in a live broadcast on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is given a red card due to four warnings during the game and therefore does not show up to the game with a new haircut like he has in the games of the summer so far.
Hans had written "bla, bla, bla" on his shirt for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
I don't know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was better to try in the game.
Hann gekk ekki í felu.
Guðmundur Benediktsson said in the Pepsi Max studio, "He wanted to get the ball every single time and if there was anyone to even out this game then I thought he would do it or make it happen," when the conversation turned to Brynjólfi.
I need to be here for the people.
It can be difficult sometimes to understand where one is at.
Hjörvar Hafliðason said, "He tends to drift out to the left side as the game progresses, but he has a very free role in the team."
Thorkell Máni Pétursson calls Brynjólf a real entertainer and is delighted to have such a colorful person in the team: "There is no doubt that this is character.
This is a fun type and I love it with the hair, and always being ready to show up and answer in conversations.
There are an incredible amount of people taken in by him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
English: I am an entertainer.
I need to be here for the people and have fun with it.
People are reading Brynjólf's interviews, people are paying attention and following what's next on his agenda.
"This man is just brilliant," said Máni.
Player KR said he wants to leave the team - "I have been in contact with some teams in Division B."
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max division, appears to be on the way out from the team.
According to Danish media outlet Bold, Tobias is ready to go back home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the matter.
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country, but first he needs to terminate his contract with KR where the Danish division starts earlier than the Icelandic one.
Tobias said in a conversation with Bold, "The group knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding."
I have been in contact with some teams in the B-division and will likely switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract with KR.
He says that he will likely have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
Companies in Denmark have likely been more affected by the economic impacts of the virus than in Iceland.
The cyclist Bjartmar has recovered bicycles for millions - Now responds after discussion with DV.
In the past year, Bjartmar Leósson has had interests unlike most others.
He recovers and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned himself the nickname "the Bicycle Whisperer" for his work.
Yesterday there was quite a stir when a person revealed a story about their interactions with Bjartmar.
English:
It was not possible to read anything else from the original writings of the electrician except that Bjartmar had stolen from him.
The text has now been edited on Facebook and the headline of the original DV news article has been updated to reflect this.
Bjartmar says that the initial reports of the incident at Austurvöllur yesterday do not accurately reflect what actually happened.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the informant of the electric scooter theft that these were indeed their electric scooters.
Bjartmar says that the supposed owner received information from someone else, but the information turned out to be wrong.
I looked at the cow and I recognized the scooter, and with information that there was an electric scooter that had been missing for a long time and had been searched for.
I hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to drive off in the car I decided to take the chance to talk to the man.
He was sure of his cause and so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally I was speaking very nicely, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken away my word.
Bjartmar says that the man with the skateboard offered him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
Bjartmar said, "Yes, great, let's just get this sorted out."
The owner of the laptop verified ownership of his laptop and left.
Later, the rightful owner of the laptop told his story on Facebook, as reported in the earlier news.
In this past year that Bjartmar has devoted to this skill, he claims to be able to count the differences he came up with on the tips of the fingers of the other hand.
Bjartmar said, "I have had peaceful interactions with the toughest people in Reykjavik," pointing out that bicycle thieves are often the least of society's brothers and sisters, addicts, mentally ill people, and other people who are on the street for some reason.
Bjartmar says, "Fíknin is a tough landlord and somehow we need to finance the next bit, unfortunately theft of such loose funds is an easy way to that goal."
My interactions with this people are so good that I have brought many of them with me on my team.
Example of people going into treatment and taking responsibility and then coming to me for help and supporting me in what I'm doing," he says.
Generally, Bjartmar's interactions with cyclists are courteous.
Summarize what he is doing and offer to show him receipts, bike serial numbers, and so on in a friendly manner.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has been little discussed.
Bjartmar says that the police are even going so far as to direct people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is unhappy with the previous news coverage of DV and claims to not be some sort of self-appointed police in a personal quest for justice.
Asked whether he is still not come to a high ice with his courage, and whether this is not primarily the job of the police, Bjartmar certainly says it is.
Of course the law requires this, but the reality of the situation is that the law is simply not attending to this.
I have, for example, watched police officers drive away from a large swarm of scooters.
She is simply speechless in these matters.
Bjartmar asks, "If the law isn't doing anything about this, and it's right in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can get results in this category, then why not?"
He said he had been so successful in riding his scooter that sometimes he would run into his "fellow riders" on the street who had just gotten their own Bjartmari scooters.
Bjartmar's request for police assistance has resulted in her not showing up at all.
"This isn't working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the fault of the bike owners either," said Bjartmar, and he finds it unfortunate that victims of bike theft have to suffer from the lack of police action in this category of cases.
The brightness of Bjartmar is not divided.
Widely one can find stories of people thanking Bjartmar for having returned their possessions to them.
Bjartmar says he has long since lost count of the number of bicycles he has delivered, but the amounts certainly run into millions, if not tens of millions.
Vega carried electric scooters, bicycles, and heavy electric carts, but bicycles can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar travels to daycare and to the other weekend he works at the farm.
His hobby of cycling is an unpaid work that he does in his free time.
Pension funds and long shadows
In 2019, there were many anniversaries in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had, in fact, been receiving pensions from the Danish king since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for officials was established, which eventually became a pension fund for all public servants.
The foundation of the current pension funds for general wage earners was then laid with collective bargaining agreements in the labor market in 1969, where it was stipulated that occupational pension funds with compulsory membership and full fund collection would take effect from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were established based on these agreements and the pension system continued to grow after that.
The pension system for workers was not the only significant change that the labor movement of the 20th century achieved through its struggle.
Unemployment benefits had been won in similar fashion in the historic strike of 1955, and the unions also achieved some success in their demands for health care and a sickness fund, substantial vacation rights, a reduction in working hours, compensation for housing and other such matters of great importance.
All of these rights were hard-fought and won, and proved to be much more lasting and beneficial than the wage increases that were lost in the inflation of the post-war period up until 1990, as many remember.
The process of establishing public pension funds in 1969 was both lengthy and complex.
In the end, even though people agreed that the funds would be the property of the fund associations, the labor movement insisted that their boards should be composed of representatives of employers and fund associations equally.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of the workforce in the management of the funds was often discussed in the wage-earner associations, but it never succeeded, and so we are still stuck with the unfair arrangement that representatives of the fund companies are not in the majority in the management of the funds.
English: Article 36 of Law No. 129/1997 on Pension Security and the Activities of Pension Funds discusses the investment policy of the funds.
The first article states that "the pension fund shall have the interests of the fund members as its guiding principle."
English: Also, Article 5 states: "The pension fund shall set ethical criteria for its investments."
English:
The Pension Fund is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in the Western Hemisphere and Europe.
The rules discuss how emphasizing environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance, can contribute to improved performance of bond fund portfolios.
The interests of financial investors and the goals of society should be balanced in a wider context.
It is important for companies, especially those listed on the stock exchange, to set a public policy on good corporate governance, social responsibility, and environmental issues.
The Pension Fund Gildi, one of the largest funds in the country, has set a "policy of responsible investments" with similar provisions.
This is all summed up here as an introduction to the newest Icelandic buzzword, "shadow governance".
English: Where a term is newly used in the language, it is not expected to have been defined to satisfaction, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "most taken": Shadow governance is when a leader of a corporate entity tells the media that they intend to send representatives of the entity to the board of a pension fund with recommendations or instructions on how they should take a stance on a certain matter.
If they do not follow the instructions, they will be removed from the administration at the first opportunity.
If the forecaster does not take this to the media and does not talk about resignation, then it is not "shadow management" after all, as such interactions between people are of course always present in the financial world as elsewhere.
I ask the reader to consider which path he finds "shadowier."
There are mainly two people who have tried to define this when it was written, on Saturday morning, July 25th, 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, a bank manager.
Both parties reached an agreement after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, announced his plan to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and pilots, and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of the Reykjavík Merchants' Association, sent out a recommendation to the association's representatives on the board of the Merchants' Pension Fund to not support any potential purchase of the fund's shares in the company, or they would be forced to resign.
Later, Bogi Nils reversed his decision and afterwards, Ragnar Thor followed the same path with his recommendations that were obviously based on Bogi's decision.
Hörður and Ásgeir saw cause to elaborate on the matter in the Friday edition of Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow governance, lawbreaking, and the great need for changes to the laws.
There was a small tuft of grass that had to bear a heavy burden, even though the blessed tuft had been in a state of connection and had been dried out quickly.
Where language is important, we should pay attention to the subject itself in the end.
I have listed here the provisions in the pension fund laws that relate to this matter.
The fiduciary duties of fund managers include taking care of the interests of fund shareholders and exercising due diligence in investments, which are further detailed in the bylaws of both the Guild and the Pension Fund of Merchants, as I mentioned.
Pension funds, however, should NOT only look to short-term return objectives in their investments.
Such would be a highly risky policy and one does not need to look far for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have been given to irresponsible adventurers and environmental activists, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was clearly on high horses when it occurred to him to lay off a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
He realized he was wrong and took it back.
Time will tell whether investing pension funds in the company can be considered responsible towards the fund members when it comes to accountability.

One of the infected did not have a homecoming test.
One of the three people who tested positive for Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from the Baltic States on July 15th last week, about one and a half weeks ago.
He is an Icelander, but he is not resident here by law and therefore did not receive clear instructions on how to comply with the so-called homecoming test after arriving in the country and go for another test a few days after arrival.
He received a negative response from the inspection of the border.
Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert on the disease prevention team at the National University Hospital and the substitute for the disease prevention doctor while he is on summer break, said in an interview with Fréttablaðið today, "He is in the Icelandic society and in reality had to take that course of action."
English: Hann used the English registration form and there is no requirement to register the social security number and if the social security number is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the second show.
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad, but due to his connection to the country as an Icelander he should have used the Icelandic one instead.
He hadn't realized this yet.
When your ID number is not registered, you need to take the initiative to get the late exam.
Kamilla says, "Both he and his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way to go."
It is clear that we need to increase the information about this while we find a way to make an automated booking system even though Icelanders do not register their ID numbers.
Or to make it more obvious who the participants are in the Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
We should treat newcomers to the country with respect, even if they are defined as participants in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six people have been sent into quarantine after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in close contact with him.
They were supposed to go to the screening, but two of them have already shown symptoms of Covid-19.
The man received a negative result from his test at the border on July 15th.
Kamilla says it is likely that he had recently been infected with the virus that it had not yet been able to be detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
She does not want to exclude the possibility that the man has been infected here in Iceland and not brought the virus with him to the country.
It is not entirely certain that this is an imported case, since it has been so long since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed here, like the two who have caused some commotion in relation to the sporting event.
She says it is very unlikely though due to how few people are around here.
Kamilla says, "It is highly unlikely," but notes that it cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic testing has identified the virus in the person.
If we get a virus type that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that it has been brought into the country.
We pepper spray and fire against protesters.
There was a confrontation between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
The police used pepper spray and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters, but the protesters broke windows and set fires.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Protests against police brutality and racial injustice were widespread in the United States yesterday evening, and the protests in Seattle were in support of the protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the assailant has been arrested.
Thousands of people gathered in Seattle in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows at the city courthouse.
The police afterwards declared the protest to be unruly and clashes broke out between the groups of protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man, who was killed by police last August, was remembered by protesters for justice.
Bill drove through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of Black National Guard members gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was killed by police in her home in March of last year.
The group carried firearms and marched in formation to closed intersections where police forced the group away from a crowd of protesters who were also carrying firearms.
75 people were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old Black man who was killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjaer: The game doesn't define our period.
English: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of today's game against Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United lose the match, and Chelsea don't lose against Wolves, then Solskjær and his team will end up in 5th place and miss out on a Champions League spot.
They still have hope of making it to the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
We are not at the end yet.
"If we get a point against Leicester I think people will say that we haven't had a bad season," said Solskjær.
"No matter what happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of ground to cover to catch up to the two teams above us," said Solskjær.
It is clear that substitutes will be made at 3 pm today, but Solskjær tried to act as if it were any other game.
If you want to be part of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and society is built on this.
"We have been presented with a great opportunity to end the period on a high and now it is up to us to take advantage of it," said Solskjær.
This is not the most important game of the season, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the soccer team, the next game is always the most important.
The outcomes do not define our era, we have already had many moments that define this era.

65,000 smit per solar cycle
Yesterday, 65,490 new cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States according to John Hopkins University.
There have been 4,178,021 cases of COVID-19 confirmed in the country since the start of the pandemic.
900 people died from the virus yesterday, and in the last four days the death toll from the virus has been more than 1,000 per day.
There have been 146,460 confirmed deaths due to the virus in the United States.
According to a prediction by US health authorities, CNN reports that the number of deaths due to the virus will reach 175,000 by August 15th.
Expect another wave of migration
The authorities in Spain are now trying with weak measures to contain the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19 on both Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more outbreaks in a single solar cycle since the beginning of May and the news comes at the same time as the Spanish begin to ease one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.
The backlash led to British authorities now requiring passengers arriving from Spain to go into quarantine upon arrival.
Previously, Spain was on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in the northeast of Spain where the authorities have taken more drastic measures to try to contain the spread of the virus.
In the capital city of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and nightclubs will be closed at midnight.
A curfew is now in effect for 200,000 residents in the Segria region of western Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and has been badly affected by the pandemic.
TUI, the largest travel agency in Britain, has cancelled all flights scheduled for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for a second wave of the pandemic, but there appears to be little interest in reimposing widespread lockdowns that have crippled economies.
To illustrate, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken a very dim view of such things as nuclear weapons which he does not wish to use.
Then, Jean Castex, the Prime Minister of France, has said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if a nationwide lockdown were to be imposed again.
Many local measures taken by government officials to reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities, or regions may be sufficient to contain the virus if it returns in the next round.
Five new cases of COVID-19 in Iceland - Three of them domestically.
Three domestic cases were confirmed yesterday, plus two additional cases at the border.
Five individuals tested positive for Covid-19 yesterday in Iceland.
In a public health announcement, it is said that one infection is linked to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP soccer match.
He has been placed in isolation and sixteen people who were in close contact with him have been quarantined.
The participant was then a member of a sports club in Reykjavik and according to the announcement, "only members of the sports team" were allowed in the sick bay.
Others who were sent to quarantine are connected to the person in another way.
The origin of this infection is unknown and contact tracing is underway by the contact tracing team of the National Police Commissioner.
The organizers of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the guidelines and regulations of the health and safety authorities that are still in effect, and appropriate measures have been taken.
Pictures of the match yesterday drew attention where one could see in very close proximity celebrating the good performance of their team on the field.
The organizers released the following announcement on their Facebook page just before 11am today.
Warning: Parents, please respect the rule that competitors must bring their own equipment to school.
Parents are not allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.
Another infection was identified yesterday that is related to the infection reported from the day before.
The Icelandic genetic research has identified the virus and revealed a new strain of virus that has not been identified here before.
We are dealing with an infection in this language as well, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection that is being discussed is from a person who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15th.
He laughed at the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six people who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them have already shown signs of the virus.
In addition, two border crossings were closed and further investigation is pending, as the protocols for border crossings dictate.
In conclusion, the National Security Division of the National Police and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer urge people to be vigilant and adhere to individual protective measures against infection.
Ask if the same person has any symptoms of the Covid-19 virus before they go to the next health clinic for a test.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite is fully booked for the shopping weekend - No more guests allowed.
The campsite in Patreksfjörður is fully booked for the weekend, according to an announcement from Vesturbyggð.
He is looking to explore other accommodation options.
English: Nefnir Vesturbyggð offers Bíldudal, Tálknafjörð, Melanes at Rauðasandi, Hótel Flókalund and Hótel Breiðavík as other options in the area.
There is still more to come in Patreksfjörður this weekend, as Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentary films, will be held in the town, just like previous years.
She has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
We can expect a good turnout at the campsite this year if the weather doesn't put a damper on things, as the DV reported earlier today from a forecast.
Be prepared for the worst weather to the south, and hope for the best for the people of Patreksfjörður.
English: The website bb.is was the first to report it, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
A multi-family house is nestled down in the best spot in the city.
Romanian workers are living free at Dunhaga 18-20.
While owners are applying for building permits for renovations, their applications have increased in the system for the third year.
In the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhood of Reykjavik stands a beautiful three-story apartment building.
The ground floor of the house is about 600 square meters of retail space.
Behind the house are two staircases each containing four quite nice apartments.
They were on the bus between 93-130 feet, although most were over 100.
The house has a considerable history to keep.
It was built in 1959 and has housed a video rental store, a shoe store, a dairy store of the Milk Association, a tailor shop, a fish store, and most recently, a university print shop.
The house has, so to speak, been made more beautiful by its owner.
The house is now under great damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
English: According to the company registry, Eigendur D18 ehf. is among others owned by Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnus represented the shareholders of Borgun and was a defender of the asset management company Borgun.
In the group of owners of the asset management company Borgunar is Stálskip ehf.
Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children are the owners of Stálskip ehf., an investment company.
Gunnar is also an owner of a third share in D18 Ltd.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once owned the Stálskip company.
D18 ehf. purchased the house in the summer of 2009 and has done little to nothing to maintain it since then.
Tell the neighbors that the condition of the house has been deteriorating steadily since, especially in recent years.
One resident on the neighborhood's Facebook page says that the house has "not been particularly lively in recent years".
Owners have been striving for several years to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house has not been in good condition for a long time.
It is long overdue to do something about this mess and unfortunate that it has dragged on for so long.
He said simultaneously that he was sorry to the owners of the house for not having driven himself to finish this, to find a mutually agreeable solution with the neighbors of the house and to end this "legal stalemate".
Just do this in accordance with the community around so that it can be driven forward and completed.
The "Legal Framework" that is referred to is the organizational process of the company that has been in place since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then sought permission to build an additional floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator building and an extension of one floor plus a basement.
The building permit that was granted for the development was appealed to the Environmental and Natural Resources Tribunal and the Tribunal invalidated it as the development did not have the support of a zoning by-law and the disclosure statement was not sufficient.
The City of Reykjavík then began a tender process and concluded it with an announcement in the Official Gazette in July of last year.
The arrangement was also beloved and the committee invalidated it in March 2020.
At this point in time, nearly three years had passed since the original application for building permission and the owners of the house were at the starting point.
The house had deteriorated significantly by this time and the neighbors were getting tired of it.
When DV asked the neighbor of the house about the situation, the neighbor's responses were varied.
Some had understanding of the owners' plans for the house, others had none at all.
Others directed the carriage towards the city, others did not.
Others were just angry but not necessarily out for anyone.
Others said the parking lot was crowded, but neighbors have used the unused parking lot of Dunhaga 18-20 for their vehicles.
The plaintiff in the case claimed to be exhausted by the bureaucracy.
It is completely unbelievable that we have to go through the process in three stages.
It's like Reykjavík City can't read.
Today the house stands empty, abandoned and neglected.
The guardian of the city's civic administration and the generous plans of the owner and the years of work they have put in are now at the starting point.
When the journalist arrived at the gate of Dunhaga 18, galloping doors and a rumbling roar greeted him.
A Playstation console and a new television were among the debris on the ground — the remains of an Icelandic summer cottage.
The old office of the University Press was opened and there were quite a few cats of the same breed to judge.
It is clear that someone has made a mess in one corner, but nothing is visible.
The stacks of sofas and rooms and some sheets of geology papers, which surely should have been a book, blew us away.
The stairwells of the apartment building were both open and alive.
The newspaperman was so lucky to run into one of the inhabitants.
The Romans were boiling potatoes for dinner and invited the journalist in.
The employees work for the staffing agency Ztrongforce Ltd.
They have been there for some time and sources at DV claim that the company has not paid for the accommodation except for heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not feasible to collect rent.
From the post boxes in the front door of the house, it is clear that there has been a number of foreign workers living there in recent months.
The temporary staffing industry has not been spared from the Covid-19 situation, as the downturn in tourism has led to a downturn in the construction sector and these two industries have been the most active in utilizing temporary staffing services.
The residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do and the work tools and equipment hung in the community to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
Despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be in good condition.
When the journalist greeted the boys in Romanian, the coldness was suddenly clear to him: At the best location in Reykjavik stands a 1,500 square meter property downgraded.
The owner wants to renovate the house for improvement and the neighbors want to improve the condition but disagree on the definition of "improvement".
The city's planning department sits between the starting point, the endless path of appeals and the possibility of complaints in the planning process and the ultimate resolution of the Environmental and Natural Resources Board on environmental and natural resource matters.
In the house live Romanian workers, perhaps even those who will fix the situation when the Icelanders stop rioting.
The article was originally published in the Sunday newspaper DV on July 17th.
We are fighting against the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on junk food advertising, following his serious illness partly due to his weight.
Johnson is scheduled to launch the campaign, titled Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, where doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycles for their patients with obesity and additional measures will be taken to increase the number of bike lanes.
Advertising for fast food will be banned on television after 9pm, according to British media sources.
The spokesperson for the government said, "COVID-19 has reminded us of the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Minister of Finance is determined that we use this time to become healthier, more active, and to eat healthier food."
Johnson has himself struggled with weight issues, and he was hospitalized when he contracted the coronavirus in spring, and it is partly due to his weight that he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Women are better suited to lead the changes.
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step the nation could take towards greater democracy, efficiency, and combating corruption and for the benefit of the whole.
We need to start making some changes now and who is better suited to lead those changes than the group of society that has an easier time being in those values.
Helga said, "There are women."
Women in Iceland are famous for their gender equality.
Standing together and being together to lead change.
So now it's up to us to implement these changes.
She said she was somewhat uncomfortable with the emphasis on Iceland as "the best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
We are not equally prepared to look at what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, people are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
English: It is a slope.
We need to know where we come from, understand the story, and listen.
Listen to the advice of established groups.
Helga said, "We don't all live by the same rules here."
She said that women are in many ways in a good position in Iceland, but added that, as is the case elsewhere, Icelanders build on very male-dominated values.
She said that politics were used to serve their own interests, power, and control that were the forces that maintained injustice in all societies.
She said, "Women have now established this group and come together and are just a bit excited that the Parliament is likely to ignore this referendum from 2012."
These are the feminine values that we are thinking this through from.
She said that from human rights and environmental protection, cooperation, and that we all sit at the same table, were the core values in the new constitution.
We are a very wealthy country of natural resources and it is unfortunate that there are people here living in poverty.
Helga said, "It's possible, we can change it differently."
It is outrageous that there is a natural law that women's work is always paid less.
It is unacceptable that flight attendants and nurses have to constantly fight for fair wages.
English: It is possible to sign the petition for the new constitution here through e-Iceland.
Attempted to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city center last night after he accosted a pedestrian and attempted to take money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær where two were arrested in connection with the case.
The police stopped a motorcyclist in Hlíðunum where the driver was going 146 km/h, where the speed limit is 60 km/h.
He had previously been stripped of his driving privileges.
The police force in the capital region had plenty to keep them busy last night and approximately 80 cases were recorded in the police log from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of buzz around compliance announcements.
On Saturday night, reports of eleven loud gatherings were received and it was noted in the police logbook.
Last night, 22 cases of vandalism were reported to the police.
Six people were held in a jail cell last night.
Last night, police were called to the Arbaeen when shots were fired into the air.
They were ready to defend themselves when the police officer arrived at the gate.
Nine drivers were stopped for drunk driving and/or drug possession.
Four were arrested for a fight in the city center last night and one of them was detained in a jail cell.
Two people were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city center and the other in the West End.
One person was taken to the emergency room after he injured himself while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
Police officers stopped the driver who was driving a car on Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to the police log, the bicycle equipment of the cyclist was in "very poor condition" and it was unsecured.
It is possible to stay in Monet's house during the weekend of the merchants.
The house that impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life in is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next few nights in the house are for the shopping holidays.
The house is small and quaint, located in the village of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until he died in 1926.
There are three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms in the house.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens at this house.
Anyone who wants to rent the house must rent it for at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb page, it is nearly free after the weekend of the merchants' holiday, so it might be a good option for someone with free time to book the painter's house.
Two nights over the weekend of the merchants cost only 964 US dollars or around 130 thousand Icelandic kronur according to Fréttablaðið.
Some of them have started to show symptoms of the illness caused by the coronavirus after attending a gathering.
Five people have tested positive for the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Some people have been put into quarantine due to this and some of them have started to show symptoms of the virus that causes it.
Three people tested positive for the coronavirus domestically yesterday and two tested positive at the border.
A specialist at the National Board of Health says that an increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading further into the community.
It has been traced back to the previous domestic case and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been circulating in the community at any time.
"This is probably something new to the country, but of course we need to be very vigilant now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the disease control department of the National Board of Health.
Most of those infected have been linked to individuals who came from abroad.
Tests are taking place in the near future, but some people who were in contact with those infected are beginning to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
Kamilla said, "Now that there is no flu season and fewer other respiratory illnesses, we can be somewhat flexible with testing individuals who during flu season would have been a reason to do something else first."
The quarantine is mostly over, but it is not ruled out that more people may need to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected were re-infected after attending a sporting event.
Has this raised questions about whether it is defensible to hold such events?
The public health director says it is possible as long as people follow the guidelines and regulations.
Kamilla says it's likely that the infected people got infected at the sports event.
If no more people go into isolation from these individuals after having interacted with them at these sports events, then we can conclude that our preventive measures at the events have been effective.
Kamilla said, "And that has not come to light."
The Public Prosecutor's Office should be subject to constant review.
Kamilla said, "We need to be prepared to take further advice or restrictions if it seems necessary."
After a week, restrictions are expected to be relaxed to a thousand people.
This new position could have an impact on resignations.
Reflection on cooking - See Elísa Viðar's recipe
Elisa Vidarsdottir is a soccer player and plays for Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a nutritionist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day's tasks and usually takes time to cook a good and nutritious meal.
Elisa says, "My typical day starts with me arriving to work at 8 o'clock."
After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I pick up my daughter from preschool at three o'clock.
Eli finds it very rewarding to pick up his daughter early from preschool.
It is good to have time with her before I go to practice later.
After exercising, it's nice to come home and just have to heat up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we find it good to watch one episode to clear our minds.
Elisa does not follow any particular diet.
She is putting the finishing touches on her master's thesis in nutrition and knows well what she should eat to have enough energy to work, go to school, take care of her family, and exercise.
What works for me is to eat a varied diet that is well balanced with proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
I think it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not categorize food as bad or good, rather nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor.
It's okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time.
Elisa has a very strong interest in firefighting.
I find a certain kind of contemplation in standing in the kitchen cooking and taking great pleasure in it.
I have to say that my confidence is with me in the kitchen and I truly believe that I am a great cook.
English: For breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a small amount of citrus juice, left to soak in almond milk overnight.
Top off this meal with whatever is available each time.
Most often it is banana and granola & COFFEE.
I am a big coffee lover.
English: Incredibly varied, but fruits or vegetables, pancakes, plain yogurt with banana and muesli, bread with toppings and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if that's what it comes to.
English: For lunch, I often make various salads from whatever is in the fridge, like quinoa, bulgur, falafel balls, coleslaw, and roasted vegetables with a good dressing. That's usually what I'm working with.
If the schedule goes completely off the rails (which often happens), then the egg machine in the office has come to my rescue quite often and then it's two sandwiches with butter, cheese, and boiled egg, don't put any more on you.
English: Give me something carbohydrate-rich for my workout, like bread with toppings, muesli, or fruit.
English: Fish is often chosen for dinner at my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
The authorities in Seattle, Washington have declared a state of emergency following large protests in the downtown area.
Yesterday, police used tear gas and pepper spray to try to clear a large area that protesters had taken over and stretched across several city blocks near the city's capitol building.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into vandalism done to a police station in the city yesterday, possibly involving some kind of explosive.
City and police authorities say that protesters have pelted police with stones, bottles, firecrackers, and other loose objects, and one police officer was taken to the hospital where his injuries were treated.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blare was to show solidarity to the protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there has been an ongoing conflict between protesters and heavily armed federal law enforcement officers.
In cities across the United States, people are gathering under the banner of Black Lives Matter to remember George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25th, protest systemic racism in American society, and demand change.
No recall before a vote of confidence.
It is not yet known whether the layoffs of Icelandair employees, which are set to take effect in the next month, will be reversed.
The voting on the collective bargaining agreement of the Icelandic Flight Attendants Association on behalf of the flight attendants of Icelandair will end at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the chair of the association, is certain that Icelandair will not make a decision on the layoffs until the results of the vote are in.
Guðlaug Líney says, "This all ties together clearly."
No resignations have been rescinded, this needs to be put in place so that the machines can be manned.
People are obviously anxious to find out if they will have a job after the month ends.
The agreement was signed a week ago, on the night of July 19th.
Gert is expected to remain in office until the end of September 2025, based on a contract that the pilots had previously voted on.
On July 17th, the board and council of trustees of Icelandair approved a general strike, which was approved by the members in a vote.
She never came, and this was decided following Icelandair's decision to end negotiations with the Flight Attendants Union, terminate all of their flight attendants, and seek agreements with another union.
The airline crew members of the company had to take on the role of security officers temporarily.
Guðlaug Líney says it is difficult to predict how the election will go.
People are in distress after this announcement from Icelandair, when all of the airline's employees were laid off and informed that an agreement would be made with another union.
She says, "Now it becomes clear whether it has an effect."
In late April, 940 pilots were employed by Icelandair, but then 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
The notice period for those with the shortest employment period is three months and ends around the July-August month end.
In that group, there are about 90% of Icelandair flight attendants.
What happens if the contract is not approved?
We look forward to continuing our dialogue with our stakeholders.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
He should be rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants think he has gone too far.
The vote on the collective agreement is over and Icelandair will announce the annual results for the fourth quarter tomorrow.
The flight attendant vote on the new collective agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's results for the second quarter will also be released tomorrow, and preliminary results indicate that the company's revenues have decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The referendum on the collective agreement between the Flight Attendants Union of Iceland and the Federation of Icelandic Industries on behalf of Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22nd and will end tomorrow, Monday, July 27th at 12 noon.
Those who are able to choose about the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay union dues to the Flight Attendants Union.
English: Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective agreement on Sunday night, July 19th, after Icelandair had broken off negotiations with the union the Friday before, following flight attendants' rejection of the previous agreement in a vote earlier in July.
Icelandair had told all of its flight attendants and crew members to report on Friday, but they were called back after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to the new contract, flight attendants must fly five hours more per month for the same base pay.
The contract is valid until the year 2025 and it has been agreed upon by pilots and flight attendants regarding how long one shift can be flown.
The agreement was presented to FFÍ members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and many flight attendants, as reported by the press, expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Most parties agree that the agreement must be accepted to keep the IFK alive.
Icelandair's results for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, with the company's EBIT, operating income for financial items and taxes, according to preliminary results, estimated to be negative between 100 to 110 million US dollars or 15 billion Icelandic krona.
Icelandair sent out their quarterly report last Wednesday, saying that the company's profits had dropped by 60 million dollars, or about 830 million krona.
At the end of the quarter, the market value and its equivalent had been around 154 million US dollars, around 21 billion kroner.
Icelandair is aiming to offer a share of the company's stock in August.
Icelandair is aiming to complete agreements with fifteen financiers, governments, and Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before going into a debt offering.
A new variant rather than a new species
A new era means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
"This is not something that has been seen domestically," says Már Kristjánsson, Chief Physician at the Infectious Diseases Department of Landspítalinn, about the news that a "new strain of virus" has been identified in the country.
Three domestic cases were confirmed yesterday and two at the border.
One who tested positive had participated in a social activity of a sports club at the Rey Cup soccer tournament, and the source of the infection is unknown and the spread of the infection is still ongoing.
Also, a case of COVID-19 was reported in an individual who arrived in the country on July 15th, and two people who were in contact with him have started showing symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, a case of infection was identified that is related to the infection reported from the day before, and after investigation by the Icelandic Inheritance Research Institute, it was revealed that it is a "new strain of virus that has not been identified here before."
The quarantine has been completed in relation to that infection.
It is becoming clear that this is not a new season, but rather the same season that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is better to talk about a new variety of the virus rather than a new species of virus.
Mar says that as it stands, this is a single case and it may not lead to anything else. He is asking what it means and if it could indicate that another wave of migration is beginning.
Már explains, "If there were cases within the country that were not connected to any foreign cases and had the same genetic makeup as this particular variant, then we could draw the conclusion [about a second wave], but it is too early to make such a statement."
Good luck in the hot pot!
Is the Icelandic secret to happiness hidden in hot pots?
The BBC schedulers are leading to a humorous video that sheds light on the country's sun-bathing and hot-tub culture.
Icelandic bathing culture is unique in the world and it is said that nowhere else in the world are there as many baths per inhabitant.
Natural geothermal energy is the basis of this, as well as the tradition of geothermal utilization that prevails here.
Education of children was mandatory in 1940, but older citizens are no less eager to use the hot water for health benefits.
Social security is described as a fixed part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and status.
Talking on the phone connects people on a personal level, both near and far, or enjoys the power of the like water: thoughts and flows of electricity charge the soul and body.
It is time to get a hundred days to the elections.
One hundred days remain until Americans go to the polls and elect a president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, though he has an uphill battle to win.
Joe Biden, the expected Democratic nominee, has a large lead over Trump nationally, according to polls.
According to a new poll from AP News, a majority of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track.
Response to Trump's handling of the new coronavirus pandemic is similarly very unpopular, and furthermore more Americans than ever before believe the president has handled economic matters poorly.
Only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the pandemic and 48 percent say he has done well on economic matters.
In March, the percentage was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to FiveThirtyEight's average, Biden has 49.9 percent support nationwide while Trump has 41.9 percent support.
Trump himself has tried to shift the focus away from his stance on immigration to Biden, emphasize so-called culture wars, and promote policies that are supposed to adhere to laws and regulations.
Biden's campaign is putting a lot of effort into keeping the focus on Trump and counting on a victory if the election comes down to how Trump has performed in office over the last four years.
Trump's unpopularity seems to also be taking a toll on Republican lawmakers, and Democrats are even feared to gain a majority in the House of Representatives, which until now has seemed highly unlikely.
Politico reported today that the alignment of parties and candidates is similar and that the Republican Party is now likely to suffer its greatest losses in a decade.
The suburbs have proven to be particularly unfavorable to the party in the 2016 elections and now it looks like that trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has attempted to scare suburban residents into following him, among other things by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and push for gender divisions.
Among other things, Trump has rolled back a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the workforce.
Then he encouraged "housewives" from the United States to read an article by the former Deputy Secretary of State of New York, in which she argued that Biden would eliminate the US housewives and Trump endorsed it.
Biden will restore your hopes and the American Dream.
The president said, "I will preserve it, and even make it even better!"
The population of US expatriates is an ever-growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of votes in this group has become the President.
In 2012, Mitt Romney received the majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the 2016 election, his support there has significantly declined.
Despite differences between polls, Biden has been polling with a lead of about fifteen percentage points over Trump in the elections recently.
Regis Philbin has been seen.
American television personality Regis Philbin has passed away, at the age of 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, host, presenter, and singer for about six decades.
He is most well-known for hosting the popular talk show Live! with Regis from 1988 to 2011 alongside Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has hosted shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the individual who has been on American television for the most hours and has been recognized for this achievement.
He has won six Emmy Awards at his career and was nominated a total of 37 times.
According to a statement from his family, Philbin has passed away due to natural causes.
The number of collaborators, friends, and admirers have been honoring him on social media over the past year.
Will the Olympic Flame be lit at the end of the races?
After a final decision was made to postpone the Olympics, an event that only world wars have interrupted until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic flame would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," presumably referring to the global coronavirus pandemic that the world is now going through together.
African people have an extra year to prepare themselves and Japanese authorities have to bear the cost of the delay.
All of them kept a lot in the house, nevertheless.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the host of the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese delegates were overwhelmed with joy.
They greeted and laughed in turn, as Tokyo had bid to host the 2016 games but the honor was given to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil instead.
This time, Tokyo and Japan both drew the world's attention.
The festivals were supposed to take place from July 24th to August 9th but have been postponed for a year and will now start on July 23rd 2021 and end on August 8th.
If there is no text to keep the game going, if the coronavirus threat is still too great, the game will be stopped.
No one wants to think that thought through to the end.
The Olympic Games are not a regular sporting competition.
Nothing is spared, the show must always be grand and strive to top the last performance.
The selection of a host city for the Olympic Games is based on the evaluation of the presentations of the cities by the selection committee.
The more impressive the presentation is, the more likely you are to get the prize.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars in an attempt to host the 2016 Olympics, which is roughly equivalent to 20 billion krona.
For the second time, when bidding for the 2020 games, 75 million dollars, around ten billion krona, were put into the promotion.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the games that year, Japanese authorities had already allocated a budget of 30 billion yen for the project.
The amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build an Olympic village, sports facilities, and generally strengthen the infrastructure of the country to host such an event, prepare for it, and hold the games themselves.
Japanese organizers have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be taking place this week but have been postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
In a report from the government auditor in Japan released at the end of last year, it was found that the cost was nearly double the amount stated.
It is likely not possible to fully cover the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost an additional two to six billion dollars on top of the initial cost.
The cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could thus run up to between 15 and 30 billion yen.
The numbers are so high that all of the Icelandic state's taxes would only cover about half of the Olympics, based on the lowest possible cost.
Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of discussion among economists, who try to analyze the numbers and examine the benefits and costs of the games.
Many seem to have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympics are less positive than expected for the economies of the cities that host them.
English: The effects of short-termism are many, for example, it increases the number of jobs in the short-term, but in the long-term it often leaves cities with high debt levels and high operational costs for little used human resources.
Rio de Janeiro in Brazil is facing serious debts due to the 2016 Olympics and has been struggling to maintain all the major sports facilities that were built for the games.
Analysis of the figures after the London 2012 Olympics has revealed that only 10 percent of those who got jobs related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
That means there were not many new jobs, only to a small extent.
Generally, cities have not fared particularly well financially from hosting Olympic Games due to the exorbitant costs associated with the infrastructure built for the games.
The potential economic benefit of increased tourist traffic to the Olympic cities as a result of the Games, though uncertain for 2021, is still generally considered a positive.
It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to accommodate all the large number of spectators who usually attend the games.
The main point is that honor is what citizens are entitled to when elected, but it is difficult to put a price on it.
Despite the tremendous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not of a nature that can be priced.
Even though the show is very expensive and there is nowhere to save, this is obviously not just about money.
The athletes are in the foreground.
For some athletes, it is surprisingly welcome to postpone the games.
Australian pentathlete and gold medalist at the 2016 Olympics, Chloe Esposito, for example, is a caselot and would have been far from good fun this summer, but she is hopeful of being in competition form for the 2021 Games.
She is one of those athletes who is just rather pleased with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after the games this year, if they had been held on time, the postponement of the games in some cases means that they will have to retire before the games take place.
Trey doesn't simply put his body through years of intense workouts.
At the 2016 Rio Olympics, few athletes captivated the hearts of the spectators as much as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Simone Biles has recently done several interviews in her home country, the United States, to discuss the upcoming Olympic Games.
She plans to compete in the 2021 games, but she is not necessarily sure she will still be at the top of the games next year, as she will be 24 years old then.
Though it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a female athlete in the front row.
Biles says, "This is a sensitive topic," but then moves on to another topic in an interview that was published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked if she plans to achieve the same success at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
Biles says, "I honestly don't know if I'll still be at the top after a whole year of extra training."
She has previously mentioned that her body cannot handle the strain of gymnastics training for much longer.
She is training hard for the 2021 Olympics.
Simone Biles acknowledges that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to abruptly stop training when the pandemic was at its peak and the gym was closed.
Bill was given special privileges rather than others while all athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold medals couldn't buy her any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like the others.
The basic form certainly looks better than most people's.
We have a strict plan now.
It was difficult to start exercising again after the gym reopened.
We started slow but we are now in full swing for the new year and I will increase the exercises regularly as the year progresses.
We obviously don't know exactly how these games will turn out or if they will even be held, but we are still planning as if they will be, we can't do anything else.
Biles says, "I have put too much into this sport to give it up now."
With her, like many others, there is a hope or maybe rather an awareness that the situation may arise that the games will not be held in 2021.
It is hopeless to predict that.
No one can know how the situation with the global coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021, so all that can be done is to prepare for the Olympics assuming they will be held that year.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
The wedding was postponed due to a pandemic.
Sarah Hyland from Modern Family has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to get married to former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
The actor said in an interview with People, "I think there are more important things to think about right now."
We definitely want to get married someday and have our dream wedding with all our loved ones present.
We have decided to postpone and focus on what is important right now, which is to help spread the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I'm paying more attention to world affairs than wedding affairs these days.
There is a lot going on and we need to pay attention to what is happening in the world.
