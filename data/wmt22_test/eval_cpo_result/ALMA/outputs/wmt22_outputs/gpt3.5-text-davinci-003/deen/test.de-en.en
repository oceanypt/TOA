The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equal to 40% of the value of the goods.
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what to include with the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
I generally agree that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, give a quick helping hand, bring the bottle, etc.
They learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 can entertain himself for a short period of time and it is okay with him, that is good.
You can best judge for yourself if it is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap up K2 and stay with him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is where the psychologist's statement comes from.
If something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Is it a risk you want to take, of course, is up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows what it is...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and entering the enclosure of his wild cats.
The case is taken up by a female detective who, after a brief investigation, comes into contact with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is an increase in suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of each suicide and document it, and post the photos online.
Ultimately, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain, and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
A woman jumps out of the window while another deliberately drives herself to death.
This facing of fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with fire.
This is the general plot, I'm fairly certain that the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the wifi password available.
I need to contact my husband first.
That could take a while.
What steps do I need to take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Kind, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Kind, four years old, has a wood splinter under the thumbnail (outside).
We tried to pull him out with tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
The child is now reacting hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we are going to the doctor.

What should I do with this number then?
Johnson will push for a refresh of Omikron.
New Omikron cases are causing concern for politicians and scientists in the UK.
By New Year's, all eligible adults in England should therefore receive an offer of vaccination.
English: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster with the Corona booster vaccinations in view of rapidly increasing Omikron numbers than previously planned.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since their second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that we are facing an emergency with the Omikron variant, so it is essential to strengthen the vaccination protection.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
Johnson said, "Boost yourselves now!"
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were recorded in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, there was an increase of a whopping 65 percent.
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent off an application.
Today, the invitation for a conversation came by email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I Googled him/her and depending on where he/she has a cultural background from, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had an undetectable defect at the time of sale.
How could a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
I tried it for the first time on #PRS_ORG#.
That has been working for about.
Not in 14 days anymore.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for them.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing about domestic violence in some detail here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to professional reasons.
English: A theme that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims don't seek help or think that we can't help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
Even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends" like?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, an awe-inspiring presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
The MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg suffered a derby defeat against the Merlins Crailsheim in the Basketball Bundesliga.
At least Johannes Patrick was reliable.
English: The Giants lost in Crailsheim for the second time in less than three months - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had looked back on the cup defeat in early October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said, "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
After the game, the tension didn't ease - it increased even more after the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
What was more disappointing than the result itself was the manner of the performance.
A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma can be mentioned as an example: The three-point shooting percentage was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick answered: "We weren't focused enough after our win at Teneriffa and didn't execute what we had trained for".
Moving the ball.
Sebastian Gleim reacted very differently: "It's great to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like being in front of 10,000 people.
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I ever trained," Gleim praised still.
While in Patrick's team even the star players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points, after they had already been behind 39:59.
Besides John Patrick, Justin Simon also got twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to lament.
On Wednesday (7 pm) the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have consulted the legal department again and have written to them again because of this.
We originally contacted each other half a year ago.
Max Raabe is turning 59, always looking sharp.
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe was supposed to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
Nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "by official order" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled for now, according to the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
In January, the artists will then make up the dates that were postponed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on December 12th, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since he was a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his classmates.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of popular songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with his blonde hair slicked back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is an integral part of the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" since 2020.
Hello #NAME#, is it possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood beforehand?
It should be supplemented with existing furniture and this way we could check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still isn't working; I can only see the cover page but I can't flip through the pages.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing.
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday) that "no new housing is created with expropriation, only the ownership structure changes".
My goal is to give tenants assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A mix of different types of landlords, such as private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies, is the best protection against monopolization.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens, and Left Party will set up an expert commission to determine how to handle the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out further tightening of the rental law in the Ampel coalition through talks with the FDP.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax anyway, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Will it ever come back again?
PRS ORG with storage space (180 x NUMBER cm),
Sounds great!
Then I will redeem it independently with the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping take?
I have already cut my finger.
That is an absolute outrage.
At least 100 deaths due to tornadoes in Kentucky.
A devastating storm system has caused numerous tornadoes to sweep through the USA.
There could be more than 100 deaths to mourn in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
On Friday night, multiple tornadoes wreaked havoc in the US, possibly claiming up to one hundred lives.
The storms left a roughly 320 kilometer-long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
The Governor of that area, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through, everything was gone.
Houses, stores, government buildings - all gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that you have sold out of display case #NAME#.
That's very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Is it completely out of stock?
Is there a possibility to order this display case in another country?
When will you respond?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the blanket in the cart and have it shipped to Germany?
I had returned an item through the contact form and wanted to inquire if it had been received or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing their slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for getting vaccinated.
They are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
Also, re-designing advertising slogans into calls for vaccination - following the German example - should increase the willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
He switched to a company he had been badmouthing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It has been one year.
He obviously didn't stay in his old position and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: oh well.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant then.
I am making a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Greetings from Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffon Pass for a group of 4 friends and I want to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet with the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes must bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
The further action should develop there.
Some miles away from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the hero and lure them into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the option to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convincing, Negotiating, Threatening, Anticipating the danger, or whatever else the players come up with.
Group Strength: 8 ordinary Goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers.
If unnoticed, the goblins will ambush the hero in a hollow path and flank the wagon with three armed with bows on each side, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is obviously gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf will intervene with two of his servants and come to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, all is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina is for Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play an important role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narrative again.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back.
Can you please have the returns sent over so I can package the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#?

I just sat there.
Here, the lower part, the part with storage, was damaged.
Will everything be picked up again or just the storage part?
I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on German Sky has been decreasing more and more, so I wanted to vent a bit with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Despite the delayed start and the start crash, the schedule was far behind the planning, but they could have still shown the last ten minutes as planned, as well as the championship decision.
It seems that, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice.
Despite being stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to the end.
Despite the difficult situation, commentator Olivier Zwartyes handled the serious accident well.
There was once again a lack of knowledge of the rules in Formula 1 among commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both of them did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both teams only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change his tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
At both Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that this option was available for Verstappen.
I think it's just basic knowledge to know these rules if you are commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is not the first time they are guessing what is now possible or required according to the rules, both of them just have constant uncertainties when it comes to rules.
Generally, I don't like Roos' artificial comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
Seriously, I actually like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant antics that make both of them seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter one brings a lot of unrest into the comment, apparently not taking it seriously.
Recently, advertising has simply taken over on Sky, in the last lap Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV since it only has the German audio track without commentary, right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing that.
Both of these channels make less advertising during their broadcasts than Sky, and they are free-to-air channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the drawbacks.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programming is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
RTL is doing a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, aside from the commercials.
Thus, the great F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested to hear your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# Pendant Light, Brass and Multicolored Glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and have not received anything yet.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday she would check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric had a hole in the front part of the chair).
I am asking for support.
Fans pumps are excellent for providing an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlifts.
This series is offered in 3 variations by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
You can see the services compared there.
Are the pumps strong enough to operate entire systems?
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple outflows.
The MK series has one, two, or four outputs depending on the model. Fan pumps are also a great way to add an accent to your aquarium, such as with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a feature.
Here, a treasure chest, shell, or something similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special soundproofed construction, resulting in low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and then it's ready to go.
The water pump should be at the same level or higher than the water level and should be mounted externally.
If the pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed between them.
Cut the air hose and insert the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backwards if it were to happen, so that the water from the basin flows through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are powerful powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it will go very quickly.
We just want to take precautions so that no one gets upset if it takes a bit longer.
Not everyone has understanding for all the employees who work in the logistics industry...of course, here, Corona doesn't stop.
Please don't rate us poorly just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the package services.
Of course, we like to complain about these services, even though we have to admit...they're having a really tough time right now.
This also varies greatly by region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly-minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers one by one climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in flight for 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
Laura Shepard Churchley (74 years old), daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew to space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and is the namesake of Blue Origin's rocket system, and Michael Strahan (50 years old), a TV host, were honored guests of the company, while the other four passengers paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each person paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She just went along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He said he would most like to go back to space again right away.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule that was detached from the rocket during the flight reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing periods of weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth's surface to be the boundary of space, however there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned mission of Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the Deputy Chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business forward largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the press of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should stay lit in one color or cycle through its entire range of colors.

Someone who works in or has studied biochemistry.
I am currently studying Biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting and I don't mind being in the lab (I already have my inorganic chemistry lab behind me).
I had of course already informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I definitely wanted to and would study until I got my PhD.
Currently, I am having doubts, especially the job prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On the one hand, you often hear about great job opportunities and that the profession is in high demand, but on the other hand, you also hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paying jobs.
Therefore, I would really be interested to know:
What are you currently working on?
Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
What did you study/ what training did you do?
Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and considering possibly dropping out of university in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down!
Extra stress before holiday and weekend holidays
This topic came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend to relax now.
Therefore, only now a post to it.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, do we have a lot of stress at our workplace.
It seems there are also days off before holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Feast of the Assumption, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-officially recognized.
Last week there was a long 4-day weekend ahead.
English: What happened last week?
Everywhere stress.
There were so many emails that had to be sent out before the long weekend, orders here and orders there, everything *urgently* before the long weekend.
Well... why because?
Because "next week then" sounds like it's been a long time and that can't be the case?
People seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as they would in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-imprisonment for holidays?
Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, all the colleagues were independently like that.
English: My question is simply this: Are we Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way?
Do you know that in the North too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home, but she hasn't bought any presents yet.
The actress and singer from Hit Radio FFH said, "Even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just take a trip to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest."
She will get into the spirit of the celebration by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
Catterfeld said, "I love it."
Until the festive days she still has some things to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to finally get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth molt and feather renewal process.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
Most feather damage seen in bird keeping is due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage is made of protein-rich substances, a rich and balanced protein diet is necessary for the formation of a perfect plumage for the bird.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large portion of the hair loss that occurs during moulting is due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
While using NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
English: NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you very much, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
This DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR was used in Schlesien and Mitteldeutschland and is very rare, likely originating from the model railway ME Heft 11/1968 conversion proposal. It is used with signs of play and missing parts, as seen in the photos, and functions well. The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG) designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Schlesien network. The kit may also have originated from the small-series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
In March 1926, the DRG determined that the delivery would be a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a Tatzlager drive from AEG, with the mechanical part supplied by the Siemens-Schuckertwerke and the electrical part supplied by them.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and afterwards found themselves on the territory of what would later become the GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the refurbishment potential of all six locomotives was determined.
As the electrification of the Central German network progressed, there was an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight train service, so in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44, and E 94 that were available in larger quantities were preferred to be built up.
Once it became clear that the processing rate of E94 could not be increased any further, E95 came into focus for processing.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own running schedule in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
As the age of the locomotives increased, the complicated controls proved to be problematic.
It often happened that shooters got stuck during gear shifts.
Then the stoker, who was constantly riding on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the couplings while the train was in motion.
Damage to the driving motors occurred frequently and led to months-long outages with the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and there was no significant expansion of electric operations planned, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter classes, resulting in the E 95 being taken out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to only have one-man crews for electric locomotives, which would have been a problem for train operations due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the last one, the E 95 01, retired from service on October 5th, 1970.
The designated new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives except for E 95 02 have been dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time for the responsible parties at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
She has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive since then.
In 1986, the locomotive was fully completed internally.
At the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is cared for in a museum-like manner.
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P Heritage Society have been working on restoring the locomotive to operational condition.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new internal and external paint job, where the transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved to be reliable due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
English: Handmade model H0 in original packaging, functioning well, but optical work on the locomotive needs to be done by the buyer, dusty, with signs of play, musty smell!!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is supported by two feet, unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't assemble the bed.
The middle beam is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately produced with errors.
The middle beam does not fit into the designated holder.
I also get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
No flat ones.
These are the correct ones in terms of shape, according to the assembly instructions, they were just too narrow.
English: But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
At my place, they are not flat.
Could I get this sent to me?
English: Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and extensive damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
Additionally, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been caused, according to the police on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
She will arrive much later then.
And I have to pay for shipping again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status so far.
The entrepreneur has now released a photo showing his COVID-19 vaccination.
Şahin shared that the illness of a friend had motivated him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false reports on social media that I supposedly was not vaccinated.
My wife and I actually received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
For the past few months, my friends have been urging me to post a picture of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors.
So far, he has rejected it because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened when I heard that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
Sahin wrote that his school friend and his family were not vaccinated.
He did not ask for the reasons.
The most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Anxiety can be hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences instead.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization for the vaccination of the vaccine.
Now the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the CEO of Biontech has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in power station: Tens of thousands of people without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had disabled a substation.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday night, 41,000 residents in several communities were affected when the power went out due to the fire.
Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption was finally resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided assistance to the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
"We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, Head of Primary Technology, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to provisionally put some of the lines back into operation, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
The power is back on.
The fire that broke out at 7:15 pm on Friday, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There are extensive cleaning and repair work needed there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back on.
Since Saturday at 6pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected starting at 9:30 PM.
Since 11:15 PM, those affected by the power outage would also have electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
The authorities had called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
English: Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) stated after a crisis meeting that it is important now for citizens to take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and to notify the local fire station if help is needed.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the residents of nursing homes were the main focus.
Additionally, according to government reports, temporary care facilities have been set up in schools for those people who are unable to provide for themselves or who require electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG# day blanket in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
I cannot mount the bracket on the tabletop.
It is about Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#.
We have received a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I cannot collapse it and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that is really easier!
English: Then let's do it that way!
Can you send me the return form by email?
The repair is now finished.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before purchasing, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber Wins
The German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.

Return the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made it new and are using version 4.5...
It could be that you have heard of problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it.
When I try to open it, I get the message, "Oops!"
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# ePub file.
Can you help me?
The chat connection is gone, now what?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you apply the brush with a new color to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the parts that will not be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component.
Pull the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers will later create a uniform surface.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates surfaces that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when they mix with regular paints.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you assemble them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or stickers.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names to trim and badges on car models: decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
A plane cockpit can be more easily covered before it is installed into the fuselage.
More important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks is taking time, being patient, and having a steady hand when gluing.
Cut out each required decal individually and lay them out.
English: Decals are also called water slide decals because you briefly moisten the back side with water until the backing paper darkens due to the moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit away from the paper and place the piece onto the corresponding spot on the model (which you had previously moistened).
While holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away sideways.
Warning: Always check to make sure the image is properly placed before completely sliding it off the paper so it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle, or tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years old.
English: I can only open a book briefly, once I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the place where I left off reading.
On Saturday I already communicated with you.
Will I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
The lamp arrived in three separate packages.
English: Still, thank you very much!
Then I will shop elsewhere once the money is back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Child wish treatment under private health insurance / What is a "claim"?
Hello everyone!
We have been in fertility treatment for some time, but now that it comes to billing the health insurance company, they are suddenly refusing.
One by one
We had applied for the fertility treatment with the private health insurance in advance and were granted 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the health insurance.
Later, we tried to have a second child and had two unsuccessful attempts, but we hadn't yet claimed them with the health insurance.
We applied for reimbursement from the private health insurance again and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, of course the most expensive ones are billed to the health insurance company) we submitted the bills to the health insurance company and got the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the health insurance company only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reasoning: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first acceptance expire.
The second child's wish is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
Questions for the experts in the round here:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (5 attempts are to be reimbursed)?
Should the private health insurance have warned us in the promises that further attempts would be forfeited with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by having the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Could you please send me the three options via email and let me know how I can best reach you again?
Okay.
We will not order anything else from them.
If you add up my sales and my friend #NAME#'s (same address) sales, you obviously have lost good customers.
You are welcome to forward this to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been initiated and now you are telling me that I have to return the item first.
I can't be held responsible for the fact that the dresser arrived completely damaged at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote.
It is clear and evident that the repayment has been initiated and I still have not received a repayment through #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't be doing that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
A office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will disassemble the cupboard and make it available to the transport company.
English: Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to purchase, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
English: Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What exactly a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
English: Wikipedia has this to say:
A low-budget film or movie is one that is made with very little money from a big film studio or individual investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
What don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
I would like to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much
With kind regards
Is there no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will soon give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
The EU incurred high costs for a "partial victory" against Belarus.
The EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
The costs, however, are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, declared the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This limbo state - Belarus is not completely giving in, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.
It appears that there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not taken a stand against it, this comes at the cost of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the unity of the Union at the same time.
She apparently cannot assert herself if a Member State decides to do its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU pays an additional price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempted Border Crossing Again
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have once again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokesperson for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to the reports, a soldier was struck in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
The Border Patrol registered a total of 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday night, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off sections of their border, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Additionally, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people in order to prevent departures.
Bossong said that the most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines.
The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard sanctions and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly shuttle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes is protesting after the controversial Formula 1 finale.
Mercedes believes that Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged breach of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second protest was lodged against the ruling at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutch driver had overtaken the car in front of him.
I am checking it.
I am speaking with the bank and will get back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park is hosting a SC Freiburg fan day.
The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of SC Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members of the Sport-Club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day.
Additionally, there were also vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars were lit up in red and white jerseys on that day.
The fox, Ed Euromaus, and many red-and-white balloons created the perfect backdrop, according to the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park, it was again demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
Seeing the beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not the original 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim".
At the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as the moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast, and sensitively listens to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be if my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your crazy chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, fix it and not all from our household.

English: Just because he says he is not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like an AfD member saying they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just leave it completely.
Yes, then you are just as hard to take seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the theory of evolution is completely lost.
God set this whole thing in motion.
English: If you are a creationist, you must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To get the best field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically free of distortion and color errors even in the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often labeled with magnification levels.
These specifications only apply to precisely defined conditions which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see user manual in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
By using an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
If the optimal usage conditions are followed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further instructions can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are selecting Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many strange situations during the sale of Christmas trees.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year he plants around 2000 of them.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many strange situations.
He says that always makes the pre-Christmas time a bit fun.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
At least I received a defective shipment and now I have paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have any debates here about which dish is better, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
Both have their name because of this.
In English, an equivalent might be something like "the twister," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with Fiber Optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble setting up a stable wifi network now.
Previously, I had a 50 Mbps DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbps perfectly, except for a few outages.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, at the other LAN module which transmits the WiFi, I no longer get the full 500, but the further away I am from the module in the house, the less I get (so using an outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This results in the internet with the new fiber connection now being slower in the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were still similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost through the power line with fiber optics?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely labor-intensive to run LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive a response.
When it is time to switch bank accounts.
Who would have thought that there would be peace with checking accounts now, they are mistaken.
Many banks have used the fall to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, while the thresholds for negative interest rates continue to decrease.
The German Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the tax allowance and even quartered it for the day money.
In the first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Now, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And not just for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements made with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is especially popular among cost-conscious customers, has reduced its free allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least 100 banks have now implemented a limit of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance were even successful in their case against this regulation before the Berlin Regional Court.
Now banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly set aside reserves - in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally unlawful and many millions of bank customers have to be reimbursed.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Their life is like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) has been chosen by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
She has an entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers taking care of her appearance.
Aniston said that she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one single chip from the bag).
It is actually a miracle that their hearts still fly to both female and male fans alike.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with love - and is still searching for her true love.
She crossed off the baby wish from the list.
She was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't do it.
It was really hurtful.
It is to be hoped that success and fame bring happiness.
Disgraceful end to a career: Raikkonen has to retire.
Kimi Raikkonen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight brush with the barrier, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo from the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the Motorsport top class.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Kimi Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and reached the podium 103 times.
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sports
The record of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I calculated that I would need to win nine and a half races per season in order to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
He initially defended Johannes Lochner's attack on Saturday by five hundredths of a second, moving from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday he achieved a bigger lead of 0.30 seconds.
Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) with his team beat out the British Brad Hall.
Austria's Benjamin Maier came in third.
Friedrich said, "We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," as he also earned his 22nd consecutive victory.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after previously coming in second place.
Christopher Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race.
Lochner said, "If I knew what he does differently, I would do it that way too."
Nolte wins at home - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track for the women.
After only placing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced with pusher Deborah Levi on Sunday to win the World Cup with a German triple victory.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She recorded her first podium finish this winter in addition to qualifying for the Olympics.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden came in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me to get my first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama took me along.
I am very happy with the progress.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also an enormous amount to do around it."
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it so I couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
Now it was said that he had expired, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again since it is currently on sale :)
Why is shipping starting on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
It was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
We still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
Don't cancel the entire order.
Only one more day, only one more week, only until XY...
Hello lovely amazing girls, girls, and women!
I have some things that I just want to write down and maybe it's the same for some others too...
I am 24, have PTSD, a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is essentially my child.
My friend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs and because I wanted to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with showering (because his hand is in a bandage due to a burn).
He is also sick with a cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2x a week) which is making it very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is having a stomachache right now, so I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have housework coming up that we obviously need to divide up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD illness is currently well-managed, I am somewhat well-treated and I am managing.
Not great, but I'm managing and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot from me; I have a written test tomorrow at 3 pm that I haven't done anything for yet, and anatomy class the day after tomorrow that I should at least prepare a little bit for.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room there.
English: So this is how my week goes: only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But does it keep going after that?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of vacation.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need these mental anchors because otherwise I won't be able to handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly infinitely grateful, I cannot express that in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my exams otherwise.
I think this has a lot to do with the mental load that women carry and that's why I thought I would find some fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole thing is a different color and the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th.
In addition, twice.
It was not confirmed.
English: I realized back in school that many religious teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me, it was always something strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed it.
English: How do you feel about it?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to keep them separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
It would just be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What would motivate someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
I hope my question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I would be happy to write in English, I understand it well.
That's been a long time, so I would stay away from it.
English: It's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help me find a movie.
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
There is a young woman, although I cannot describe her in detail in the real world.
In the realm of the dead, there is a young soldier wearing a uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean.
For some reason, paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Realm of the Dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to gain life for himself.
The transition is also probably the tomb of the soldier.
At the end, both soldiers are fighting against each other, I believe.
If this rings a bell to you, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her belly since week 1.
Fast forward: Still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one would think.
Make sure everything is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often, but no minute-by-minute surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and our had no sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when it is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it stand up a bit from its belly?
Does it lie face down directly in the mattress?
You can infer from that whether everything is okay.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Additionally, we are already "regular customers" with you and have purchased many items.
Why are you only offering me 20 euros?
Hello, I emailed one of your colleagues yesterday and haven't received a response yet.
It is about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (Order Number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not usable.
To put it plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
Yes, I know myself that not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the policy of this station is now really bad.
Almost every format is sponsored, but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Arno said, "We don't want to be a never-ending billboard."
What are we now?
A generic advertising channel trying to reach the elite fan with its BilloMerch.
And then we have Marah's Do's and Don'ts.
These rules apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and is trying to make a profit from the explosion of the rented rooms.
How are we supposed to like all of this?
If you like it, I think it's terrible.
I am requesting a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus breach due to damaged delivery from #PRS_ORG#.
My little heat friend is versatile, whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they are not feeling well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable for use as a heat pad exclusively for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for any unusual odors, mildew, or scorch marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner pillow from the cover before warming it up!
Heat in the microwave at maximum 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!).
After heating, evenly distribute the heat throughout the pillow by shaking it!
Put the inner cushion back into the cover afterwards.
On the first warm-ups, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, but it will disappear with repeated use.
English: Make sure to follow the specified warming instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Check with the manufacturer's instructions before heating the pillow in the microwave to make sure heating grain products is allowed.
After the heated inner pillow has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43°C) on your arm pit!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh bruises, contusions and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor diseases, or if you are pregnant, please consult a doctor before using.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are coming out, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and in a way that is inaccessible to children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authority of the country where the user is based.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30°C.
Please pay attention to the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt is second after the first half of the season - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf.
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
For Ingolstadt, it is not running well even under the third coach.
There was jubilation in Darmstadt after their late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer being charged by my power adapter.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still be working.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to operate.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start up even with the power adapter plugged in.
After that, I took out the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Do you have any ideas?
English: A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on battery power?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you so much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to be brought to my room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat area is....
Often on tour and still bringing a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
The 20 liter capacity can easily swallow larger photo equipment, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday items you need, stay organized and separate from your photography equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design packs a punch - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: one is the conventional top flap, which can be secured with the MagLatch closure system, an exceptionally well-thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven successful with messenger bags.
There is a metal closure hook in the closure flap, with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, securely riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, take a lower one.
The snap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can be securely closed without having to latch the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
This clever detail also greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: when you take not only your photography equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can customize the interior space (more on that below) and easily store items separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable straps help with that.
The backpack's outer shell is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, so the contents will stay dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for an email from your support.
English: #NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the
The shipping company has announced contact to arrange for the pickup of the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any message.
I request immediate processing.
I have now been speaking with the third support representative, and none of them have been able to do more than promise that I will receive an email confirmation.
This is regarding the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you so much for the help.
I wish you a pleasant evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12/1/21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than what I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon to me, then I will place a larger order right away, but I did keep the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
I could not have foreseen that last year would have gone differently than expected, and I was not able to redeem and resolve it in a timely manner.
But I, as the customer, am the one suffering the damage and I do not accept that.
English: Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Röttinger brake discs are made from castings and then machined (drilled and cut).
All tinted windows are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics that are specific to certain windows and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created that is aligned with the balancing of the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additional openings created increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic qualities of our customized windows emphasize the character of each car through attractive and striking appearances.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In Winter 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Despite trying to keep his discovery a secret, news of it spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels almost sprang up overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game you are a pioneer searching for wealth in the West and trying to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You must outperform your pioneering colleagues in order to not go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your board allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your own individual playing style with fine adjustments.
English: Coloma spans a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can take actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a blockade!
This disables one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
The announcer turns to a new location at the start of each round, changing the available actions.
This will continue until the bidder has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shooting game where players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough Gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they will receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is tallied.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take the shipping method, Parcel (Games wrapped) up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
Psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, so I watched it right away.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Kids Are Becoming Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce debate about parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to bear.
I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other responsible adults should never, ever, ever seek power over a child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as is sensible and possible in the situation.
I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the removal of the testing requirement for those who have received three doses of the vaccine.
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide abolishment of the testing requirement for those who have received three doses of the vaccine at their next meeting.
"We countries need clarity quickly on whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
Health Minister Holetschek said that the elimination of the 2G plus requirement for those who have received three doses of the vaccine is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated".
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to "make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference already on Tuesday next week". − afp
I want to return the lamp.
How should I best proceed?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer is possible.
I have updated my account information.
What could be causing this?
English: What you are describing is referred to as "Awareness," which are sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images, and most rarely perceiving pain.
For this topic relevant: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut, a very deep anesthesia is avoided.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthetic consultation.
Certain anesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) come with a slightly increased risk.
Dear everyone, this comment of mine correctly describes awareness, however, by definition, u/Nitemarex had none.
I misread their comment.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the broken chair.
That is standard in the eCommerce field in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if you will at least take back the defective chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
We will also lose some money.
I already sent you an email which you have not responded to.
Again, the question.
On the order and invoice, it states that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver to the doorstep due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
Yes, I must cancel the order since I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
English: I had posed a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has established himself as a theater critic and as an impresario.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An Old Man Gets Older".
The harrowing diary of a slow farewell to the world, kept by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
In the middle of reading, the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads, "I already give thanks for my life here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets used mainly in the European area as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association (EPAL).
In Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in 2020 according to data from Statistics Austria.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected.
New York is hosting its first MLS Championship.
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout 4-2.
In the Eastern Conference Finals, New York prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
English: Rouladen Tips & Tricks
English: I got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was served at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery soft!
Thank you again for that :)
Now I'm getting the hang of it and I want to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef stock.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What happens next?
What is happening with the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English may not be as good anymore, but I can manage it.
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been processed.
The money still hasn't come to me until today.
Please check there.
Where to find Christmas roast in Lübeck.
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas season as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not gotten any poultry yet?
Time is running out now.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME knobs, you can adjust both the desired level and the amount of distortion of your sounds.
The amplifiers of the VT+ series also offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "Gain" and distortion.
Higher up it was already mentioned that you can even make a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL control if it gets too loud.
With the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
This attached signal is processed with a speaker simulation, so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get an excellent "acoustic" sound impression.
You can plug in a CD or MP3 player to the AUX port so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
Those who additionally purchase a VFS5 footswitch can conveniently call up the sounds with their foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and tap the tempo of compatible effects.
This is essential for live performance.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen that with others.
Is there a way to return the lamp?
Is it too low to hang over a dining table?
I would like to return them then.
Can you help me with this?
And the dresser?
Will we get another update in the next few weeks about the exact delivery date?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would also be satisfied with a discount or coupon.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only spending over 1,000 euros on goods I don't need is a bit too much.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations over nuclear agreement.
Progress is reportedly being made in negotiations over the revival of the international nuclear agreement, according to Iranian sources.
Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics to be discussed, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri to the news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", as initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement had resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Representatives from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now has highest Corona incidence in Germany
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in the country.
As the only state, the value is above 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had an incidence of more than 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day rate of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence rate nationwide, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were receiving intensive medical care in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends there may be delays in reporting.
Additionally, health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with the recording of new cases.
English: I understand.
The delivery is not until the beginning of March, so it might be possible by then.
I have to print it out, stick it on the package, and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Do I need to click/specify/fill out anything else here?
I want to avoid that exactly, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to cover the return shipping at my own expense.
In my opinion, an 8 euro return fee is an outrage.
It is time for change.
Greetings, Bundestag! I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the purpose of this post?
If you look at the activity in the German Bundestag in the past few months, one thing is clear: it is non-existent.
We have gone into a winter hibernation and extended the summer lull for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the cause?
Mostly, this is likely to be related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have been handled here and how we generally stand.
In recent days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here still really want the Bundestag.
What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asked to keep it alive.
The initiative was started by u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and found, simply put, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Goals
How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing orders need to be changed/adjusted/removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How can we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together and let us democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you for this.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the #PRS_ORG# quilt, is it also available in an oversized size, like 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cupboard will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to take action now.
I do not have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the cupboard as much as possible for pick-up - you will need to discuss with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pickup date.
Is there a guide for assembly?
How long would I have to get this or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She used to live a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and currently only eats meat very rarely.
I was a vegetarian for a few years before as well.
In response to the question of whether I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I thought for a long time that by being a vegetarian I was supporting animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that her side was becoming disgruntled, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian reduced animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too blunt?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, I'm quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without me intending it.
A harmonious-loving vegan greets you (;
It is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
English: Unfortunately, I cannot be present due to a funeral, and that cannot be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From February 1st, I will be available again continuously.
The Lahnsteiner Wehr is prepared for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the state.
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new rescue vehicle for water rescue of the volunteer fire department of Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Peter Labonte, Mayor of Lahnstein.
The appliance wagon is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a continuous expectation of increasing investments: The boom of hotel cruises on the Rhine and Mosel Rivers, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but nothing worked after I synchronized, removed, and reloaded the app.
I am a bit frustrated because this whole process has taken up a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
All right, that's settled then.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 Standard, the aforementioned values were determined in the Fenix Lab at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity, and with the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.

Thank you for taking on this whole thing here, I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that is, we were also armed officers in the executive branch, but I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be oversimplified.
Generally, it should be said that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that people who are drawn to the right-wing conservative magic may have difficulty dealing with reality, since in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggerated feminine cliché gay, because there are hardly any of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who don't show it unless they tell you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or put their own at risk for you.
Even though it may sound strange at first, in my experience, these marginalized groups also represent a conservative stance, meaning they are proud of Germany and feel less supported by overly left-wing politics, even though these policies are supposedly fighting for them and trying to make things right for them. They just want to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, since police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right-wingers there. However, it is completely exaggerated by the media that these people are allowed to openly express their opinions or even openly plan any state-endangering plans, and it also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad start to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
Even it happens that certain right-wing comrades meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, something like this is well fought and also countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined and that is a good thing in my opinion, that we simply cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered already in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer available.
I had been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black be delivered to Germany or is this basket available somewhere in Germany?
I always find only you as a partner company.
At the top edge of the wooden part, there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow.
On the mirror itself there is a small scratch.
Is the child orderly?
Hello, I have been concerned about something for a while now.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I'm independent, with very little free time), but I have been struggling to keep my household clean and organized for most of my life.
There are always times when everything comes to a standstill, and then every now and then I get motivated and I tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never the case that someone could come over spontaneously.
My husband is not better either, unfortunately, it bothers me somewhere but usually household just loses out to work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we like to cook.
Have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We don't have one yet but we are working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
For me, I don't have much motivation, it doesn't bother me too much as long as there are no visitors and there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child give you a greater incentive to stay organized or do you remain sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.

Pursuing a career in social work as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have completed a training in software development and have been a qualified professional for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have an anxious-avoidant personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly translated, that means I have no self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told that I come off as unapproachable (although I think that has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I would rather work in, for example, addiction counseling or family support than as a street worker or in an open youth center.
I don't know if the actual workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The AVPS is already causing problems for me (emotionally) in my job, because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I messed up the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really incompetent" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
There was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by returning please?
If I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message "Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book" appears.
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The bird breaks down the protein ingested from the food in its digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and then builds its own proteins from these, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in nestlings and the regrowth of feathers in molting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it can lead to disruptions in the breeding cycle.
After this short-term supply of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

After this short-term supply of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).
Add 1 g of NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One level teaspoon (included) is equivalent to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially until the onset of new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose will be administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored in a dry place, away from direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
In Germany, warranty claims are valid for 24 months.
That is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
English: Statement of a community worker in contradiction to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
English: I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree is to be cut down.
A petition has also been submitted to the municipality.
An employee is writing to me that felling fruit trees, and thus walnuts, is not part of the regulations.
In the charter, the walnut is explicitly specified as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the bylaws are clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message.
Well, then I still have a sofa with no use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, the only question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket shipped to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking News: Serious traffic accident near Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on State Road 2179 between the Selb-Nord exit and Plößberg.
According to the police press release (14:03), a car has gone into the opposite lane while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Okay, I understand.
Good, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Rats and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I start rambling here... In short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the ref as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in that field (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything specific here).
English: I found the whole thing too boring and looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
Eventually, I ended up in teaching and was sure that this was it - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
Before, I always decided to keep going and finish at least the sketch, then I can always switch later.
But right now I'm completely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's vacation time, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the referee, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was my weekend and my time off was my time off.
I had the day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now even the family gathering is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Generally, it's fun and from an outside perspective, the refereeing is going well in terms of feedback and such.
I'm completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing that.
I am wondering if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old field where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, even though I found the work kind of boring, but was paid appropriately and worked together as a team instead of being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back in the same place a year from now and be unhappy again.
You can tell it's all a bit of a mess, but maybe as an outsider you have some advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, where I'm completely overwhelmed and start crying at the mere thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
Maybe your opinions will help me to at least see some light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for now.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has at least become a bit clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been constantly evolving, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
We are introducing a brand new modeling engine with the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps that is absolutely up to date with the latest sound technology.
Thanks to Virtual Element Technology (VET), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp, of course.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they can better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
Additionally to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system, from which natural resonances just seem to pour out.
With VOX's Tone Room software, you can even correct and twist historical facts on a virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly how you've always imagined them.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined multiple times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they need.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power amp is primarily responsible for the tube-like character of an amplifier and based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit equipped with a 12AX7 tube of every VT+ amplifier perfectly captures the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
The NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, the Magic lose to the Clippers.
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine, but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it can be adjusted to fit your photo equipment needs and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and lenses.
Possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a hot-shoe flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories.
Those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: likely the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows have caused significant damage on the Canary Island.
Is an end in sight?
The volcanic eruption on La Palma has been going on for 85 days now since Sunday, making it the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
The eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, lasting 84 days, was previously considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists still do not dare to make a prediction as to when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, President of the Island Council, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the over 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas formed from cooled lava with a combined size of about 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit, and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
The newspaper "El País" reported that 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and more areas were severely affected.
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly holiday.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring together our increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas Became the Christmas Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in some way on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the window of three women in one night to spare them a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular German custom emerged of filling the boots of children, especially, with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they reject the veneration of intermediaries between God and humans.
For these reasons, they are objecting to the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer take such detailed questions so seriously, it only annoys a few people that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still a firmly established part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the Martin custom of Martin singing and Martin procession.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires from socks to coveted luxury watches in front of the door and under the Christmas tree.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, however, there is a joyful confusion over the question of who brings gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is essentially a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the more stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses pulling the sleigh as a troika.
In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

The police shot a suspected bank robber near the King's Palace.
Near Kensington Palace in London, a man armed with a weapon was shot by police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
In the area around Kensington Palace, there are several embassies located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with two ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum burn time 10 hours.
The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow with inner color.
"Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone is responsible for this solar light to shine fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in six different colors).
The edge-less, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he is able to assert himself due to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation work: "Smart Stone" does not require wiring or batteries as a solar light.
Place the "shining stone" in any sunny spot during the day.
Two included ground stakes provide a secure hold if needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is durable and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight hits the casing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" begins to light up automatically; you decide what color: in addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from.
Even shutting off happens automatically eventually, once the battery charge has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle will start over the next day.
I have done this multiple times and it doesn't work.
Sorry, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if my coupon isn't applied, then I won't order anymore out of principle.

The load regulation can now be adjusted to even difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows for automatic tuning of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder provides enough power with up to 1.5A motor current for older motors.

Pill Problem
Hello dear ladies,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year on Reddit.
English: Regarding my problem: About five years ago, I reluctantly started taking the pill again, mainly because I had incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave this behind, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I got an explosion of acne from 0 to 100 during my last two-year break and it was everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two year break, things never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and fuss-free, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
The gynecologist didn't take me very seriously and I still have to wait for my dermatologist appointment.
Thank you so much to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, skin is such a thing.
English:
I have tried all sorts of different diets in relation to my chronic illness and have settled on a diet low in sugar, dairy, and meat because nothing else seemed to work properly.
It could also be that hormones are simply the problem, but if you have construction sites everywhere like me, you don't really want to go looking for what else could be wrong.
I had already given everything to her colleague Semina or something like that.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
English: I have to work in between and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe something was wrong.

In the name of the people: Laypeople render judgments.
In the courtroom, they are sitting in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
The opinion of the lay judges is very important, even though they do not wear robes: Lay judges, together with professional judges, decide whether and for how long someone should go to prison.
Two of them are discussing their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht with the "Public": Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the total 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I can't get into my customer account.
Could you please resend the invoice from order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no way of storing this for so long.
We will use the table as offered by you as if it were ours.

Does the cabinet need to be completely disassembled for pickup and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
A 110-kV underground cable will be newly constructed in 2022.
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now announced this.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the substation Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning!
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue parcel number #PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
Have a great start to the week!
Forget about that, I already explained it multiple times yesterday!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and they are refusing to come into the apartment due to their regulations.
This means that the dresser cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, which is why the inquiry was made to #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
English: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been teaching since the summer and I enjoy it, but I am currently having a lot of difficulty planning my geography lessons in an efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well-equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as a medium.
At school, I can only make black and white copies for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a lot of time to plan my hours.
We are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me each hour stands on its own.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need time for tutorials, etc.).
I usually start my planning by considering the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can structure it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
I am not very satisfied with most of the tasks in the book Terra.
Therefore, the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
Most stores are only allowing people who are vaccinated or recovered to enter.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for the retail sector, according to the German Retail Federation (HDE).
Stefan Genth, the head of HDE, criticized that there have been declines in sales at stores selling non-essential items.
According to a recent survey by the HDE of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of businesses had a negative outlook for the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
Genth said that what was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit.
Merchants with 2G access restrictions lost nearly one third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only running well in the food retail sector and in the online sector.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The Chief Executive Officer said that shopping with a mask, social distancing, and a hygiene concept is a safe matter.
He emphasized that shopping with 2G will not help us in the fight against the pandemic.
The current regulations discouraged customers and required a high level of personnel.
He demanded that the wristband regulation should be allowed nationwide.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the bracelet they received.
Additionally, in retail, random checks should be sufficient, similar to the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested) in public transportation.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of pre-Corona levels without 2G, and the revenues at around 90 percent.
"These numbers are sure to drop now in the middle of such an important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called band solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it back into the package.
How do I proceed now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
The modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
Besides adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle which allows you to light up large areas at relatively close distances is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on set and in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
English: There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the package)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To adjust the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, resulting from the ability to operate with cost-effective NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power through the supplied power supply.
The structure of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve for attachment, so you can directly attach it to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using stops on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and thus designed for durability and hard use.
Additionally, a swivel joint is included in the delivery.
Great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
You can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"The party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-filled comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had lost their last two games in a row, seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
Then Eintracht Frankfurt turned it up, scoring five goals in a good hour to vent their frustration over a mediocre start to the season and winning 5-2 in a spectacular fashion. "It's amazing what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN, giving a "general praise to everyone who was involved."
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still in ninth place and not meeting their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2:0.
What happened next impressed even the SGE coach.
"When the players came back and put in a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am insanely happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to play for the first time since the fourth game and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular delight for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also feels well-prepared in terms of personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one should "proceed step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (6:30 PM, Sky).
I received an email that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and having it forwarded, no luck.
Can it be sent directly back to me or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
English: That would unfortunately mean for me that I won't order again because it already took very long.
Have you ever sat on the PRS chairs?
A setback for the women's handball team before the quarterfinal against Spain.
Germany's female handball team slunk off the court with hanging heads and blank stares after the humiliation against Denmark.
At the conclusion of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now must face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," judged German national team coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first loss in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as the runner-up behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
Captain Emily Bölk said, "That was a bad game from all of us, we need to delete it."
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday in order to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We must now look forward quickly."
From front to back not up to par.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the start.
Mistakes and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counterattack.
The hoped-for spark was not this.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an impression - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially when backcourt player Mia Zschocke was soon after shown a red card for a hard foul on her opponent.
She is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
In the closing stages of the first half, the DHB selection got into the game better and at least came within five goals by halftime.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
The Groener-Schützlinge sinned again in all areas, making it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal contenders in the final round.
In the following, the German team was unable to muster an improvement in performance and left the court as the clear loser.

The title indicates that I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these are almost finished for the most part, it will continue to be partly in vaccination centers for me afterwards.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit regarding organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not related to a personal situation (e.g. "I am taking medication X, is it compatible with the vaccine..").
My responsibilities include educating people about the vaccine, determining eligibility (whether a person is eligible for a vaccine according to the Coronavirus Vaccination Order and has no contraindications), medical documentation, and potentially emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
We often don't have a doctor in the vaccination teams, but "only" (God forbid, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who can't (aren't allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so I usually do most of the vaccinations myself.
English: Heavy "skin peeler" question: Amberger knows the solution.
English: What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television show "Wir in Bayern" has caused intense contemplation.
Unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
And also nobody who needs everything to go quickly.
People heard from the TV presenter that this was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg communicated the solution, which likely caused surprise among many Upper Palatinate people.
The audience learned that "the huidlerer" is a rag used to wipe down the stove.
Language experts Antony Rowley, consulted by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With this, an educational gap was closed - likely also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: Oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have rebooted, connected, synced, and repaired the #PRS_ORG#.
Nothing helped.
Is tire selection for a racing bike really that puncture-proof?
English: This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm because I wanted to at least do some training in preparation for my bike ride next week.
Said, done and I rode off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what usually lurks in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened.
There is glass on the track.
Zack, there was loud hissing and my back tire didn't want to go any further for the rest of the journey.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
Then, in terms of morale, it wasn't too bad, maybe it's better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike ride.
Now I am facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey ahead of me over several days, I would really not like to encounter this problem multiple times.
It wasn't really bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had ridden 120km on the day I picked up the bike until 2pm!) were already labeled as suboptimal, since he had been riding them on a roller for several years.
If I think about having to change a tire after driving 80-90km, then I'm probably in a really bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now that sounds very tempting indeed.
But are these really unbreakable?
I don't really feel like spending 40€ per tire just to be disappointed in the end.
I'm still wondering: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike right now.
There are some Marathon Plus tires that apparently have this, but most of them are wider.
Is this a problem?
Would you generally recommend different tires for a road bike?
The Swallow page seems to recommend the Durano DD more to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for the help and best wishes!
The car skidded and crashed into a tree: the driver was fatally injured.
The 53-year-old had crashed his car against a median strip for unknown reasons on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, according to police reports.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man in the car was trapped.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
The new addition is called SOLO 15 and visually resembles its larger predecessors with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can thus be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
The SOLO 15 is generally well-suited for people who prioritize sound quality over maximum volume, as it can achieve an exceptionally high level of sound.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing nearly unfiltered sound pressure levels of that magnitude.
That doesn't mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she acts remarkably mature and is extremely impressive and precise for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble boost.
This is generally common with broadband to optimize the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is precisely aligned to the listening position and offers very clear and fine sound.
Rotating slightly outward can reduce the high-frequency range and make the sound warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of each component of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a sound dynamics that is unparalleled.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
It is recommended to start by making thoughts about the final look of the speaker in order to plan for any necessary changes during the building process, as with all of our kits.
If you want to veneer the enclosure, you must adjust the speaker recess accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the boards have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate at the corresponding location in order to be able to pass the cable through it later.
Using a router, the speaker opening in the front is now followed so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
English: The back of this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM will get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of them.
The rear wall, lid, front, and bottom will now be glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if desired, for example if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot follow, so the two sides, as well as the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit will make it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall.
Afterwards, a round router is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
The following step is to mark and pre-drill (2.5 mm drill bit) the mounting points of the speaker chassis and the terminal block.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuumed/blown out), one begins to lay the cable.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
Push the entire, uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, leaving about 30 cm of it sticking out.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there.
Below, the crossover is prepared and installed.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly Instructions Crossover Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the 8mm cable opening inside the box should be sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening to seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the dampening according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
The polarity is important here, so the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a sheet of dampening material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed throughout the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
Hello everyone!
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
We are unfortunately unable to get more than four people into the studio for known reasons, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
But at least three people will be joining us via video call, so we can watch the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans streaming and hopefully thousands of you!
We are doing our best to avoid delays or other issues.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Prepare drinks ahead of time, plan for good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
