The big return of the Czech charmer is coming soon.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a tough period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
A thirty-one year old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goalie of Litvínov, Plzeň, or Chelyabinsk was injured during NHL preparation in October of this year.
Halfway through the game against Vegas, he was substituted and has not appeared on NHL rinks since then.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to the other.
Denver announced at the beginning of October that Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury to the lower body.
His return to the NHL net extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning American time, he was called up from the farm, where he had caught four duels and showed his old form.
V AHL has credited 94.5% of interventions.
The graduate of Plzeň hockey wants to finally make his mark and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In his last season, he had problems with his hips and in the shortened pandemic season, he didn't catch a single game.
In the NHL, "Francík" has played in 36 games, with a save percentage of 92.3%.
Charles is putting a mask on Camille for Christmas wishes, William and Kate are posing in Jordan.
English: British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during their trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish this year.
Prince Charles also shared his wishes, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at a horse race.
The British news station BBC informed about it on their website.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues, and charities they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki and Princess Charlotte has a dress too.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same shorts and collared shirt as Princes George and Louis.
It is not clear who took the photograph, William and Kate did not provide this information, nor is it clear when it was taken.
The royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas card on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their rural estate in Norfolk County.
Prince Charles and his wife Camilla also released a picture to serve as a Christmas greeting.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured at the races in Ascot in June.
Charles, wearing a top hat and a face mask, is helping Camille put on her face mask that matches her light-colored dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbr a million for the title, but Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Police investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the allegation that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, was promised one million Czech crowns from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
efotbal.cz reported that they had obtained access to parts of police files.
The chairman of the board of the Vršovice Club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red-and-whites had not committed any corrupt practices.
The server released transcripts of police wiretaps, in which former Slavia sports director Jan Nezmar is the main figure, who left the championship club last summer.
Former influential official of the Red and Whites was, according to the file, in frequent contact with both Berbr and former sports director of then second-tier Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The police reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi had promised a financial reward if they won the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe by the officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
According to the criminalists, Berbr not only met with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia Tvrdíkem later on.
The log does not indicate whether the police are still investigating this information according to the server.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt behavior.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively sought to change the status quo in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative for its development.
We have never committed any illegal acts, sought to influence referees in violation of fair play rules, and provided no financial remuneration to anyone in this regard," Tvrdík said to Seznam Zprávy.
In the podcasts, among other things, Nezmar is unsparingly insulting some former Slavia players of dark complexion and also slandering his former boss Tvrdík.
Last October, a police raid at several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the Czech Football Association, sparked an investigation into alleged match-fixing through referees.
The highest-ranking person involved in the scandal is Berbr, who no longer holds any football positions.
In mid-January, just like former Vyšehrad sports director Rogoz, he was released from custody.
Cold War LARPing involves helicopters, tanks, and BVPs.
The guns will be new, but of a generally worse type (gunners must leave the armored cabin and carry shells by hand without protection).
Toyota Hi-Lux cars are new and good.
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus it has already been possible to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Planes: combat- decent, but at the end of its lease, transport- too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types with no combat potential.
We don't have any rockets (but we manufacture and export them abroad).
PVO: Cold War-era, outdated; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
The store is right next to the city.
I went there to sit down because beavers were coming out of the river and causing damage to the crops.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped that he would leave before something came out, but of course the fox went soon after.
I let her come within 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost pooped his pants, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I shouted at him that it was a fox.
Before I got off the saddle, he was gone.
That means I don't like men to be lazy.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would take a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen on thermal vision, which almost everyone has today.
So put your valuables in a visible spot, close to your feet in your sleeping bag and you should be good.
Vojtěch vs. Hamáček
Internal procured respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, respirators, and face masks for professions closest to the coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns in the past weeks for their acquisition.
Server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during a single day, the amounts for respirators differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices fluctuate so dramatically?
Which authorities acted frugally?
Why did the others shop more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with the iRozhlas server editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I'm probably not affected by the memories of the Czechoslovak People's Army that older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from mandatory military service.
We don't have large stockpiles of equipment that recruits can take up, we don't actually have modern equipment even for existing professionals, furthermore modern equipment is becoming increasingly complex, so the skills of the reserves will be rapidly diminishing over time.
For modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can be deployed, they will take place very quickly, there will be no time to retrain anyone.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense have great importance for countries like Ukraine, where mass guerrilla warfare can be waged and it is also an explicit necessity for deterring the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, fighting will only take place in a conflict of such a scale and intensity that guerrilla warfare will be irrelevant, and we do not have the suitable geography for it.
We don't have individual skills mainly.
It's not the worst.
The worst part is that half of them are playing as if they had it.
You look at the guy who two minutes ago couldn't hit an open goal, charging into attack by himself against two or even three Swiss players and you think to yourself, "What does he think is going to happen now?".
Of course they will take him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "to draw a defender" is so terrible that I caught myself being genuinely surprised when I saw our attacker manage to get past one of the opponent's players.
The first swallows
The Covid-19 pandemic is slowing down, however experts do not expect any major turnaround in the coming weeks.
The pressure in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time yet and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is known: the Omikron variant, which is likely to spread much faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it cannot be said with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired from previous illness helps against it.
English: This week, however, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the COVID equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new antiviral drug, molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, reducing the risk of severe illness and associated hospitalization by a third and allowing for home treatment.
Soon he should also be supplemented with the drug Paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the current results reports a success rate of 85 percent.
The first shipments of monoclonal antibodies to the Czech Republic have highlighted not only the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, but also the question of how the local administration is prepared for the incoming drugs.
As was said, Merck's molnupiravir will be the first to be made available to domestic patients.
The company finished first in the race because the drug had been in development long before the current pandemic began, with the goal of finding an appropriate treatment for equine viral diseases on the South American continent.
These studies often overlook the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to speaking "as it comes to us".
You will do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you no without hesitation.
In the West they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist scum.
Then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
He is afraid of cancel culture, saying this publicly means losing his job and facing a media lynching.
East looks bad and West looks good in the polls.
She will really find out what people think.
In France, both Le Pen and Zemmour have over 20% support according to polls.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Due to the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to re-learn where everything is, all objects are exactly the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
It is funny that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or for the speed of deployment due to its more western location.
In the underground shelters (there are two in each maple tree), only the heads of the rockets were kept, not the entire rockets as is said.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived to pick up the head and mount it on some kind of carrier.
Besides the museum maple, the rest are in a dilapidated state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a classmate who was a Romani, and we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty chill, made good jokes, often over-expressed himself, but he was like our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was rarely absent, he went regularly, he did sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he was always neatly dressed.
He went on school trips in nature, did all sorts of mischief, but was still okay, never really getting into any trouble.
In eighth or ninth grade, siblings, Roma, enrolled in the same grade but different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police were often called to deal with it, they threatened and intimidated other students..
I personally sell something on an ad occasionally (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to pull any tricks on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way; the guy called me a month later to say he had transferred the title to himself.
I say that I am not a racist, it doesn't matter to me if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as is expected in polite society (work, function, don't beat women, just normal behavior).
But if someone comes, stretches out their hand, evicts people from their homes and apartments, creates chaos around them, causes trouble.. it doesn't matter what color they are, but I will be bothered.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they integrate into our society, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily, but at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, it is all the same to me as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice.
A young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot, Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for South Bohemian emergency medical services, told Právo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
An eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for unknown reasons veered off into the opposite lane in a bend.
After a collision with a Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on the roof off the road, according to a spokesperson for the South Bohemian police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
He sustained multiple injuries and remained trapped in the vehicle.
After the rescue, he had to be provided with immediate pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the Czech Budweis hospital in a stable condition, stated rescue worker Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, customers often do not provide the information about them.
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars up, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where shipping is often free,” explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly more expensive for him, now he must add VAT and provide customs information to the post office.
He will receive an email notification that customs officials are expecting the arrival of the package.
English: Just fill in the shipment details, and if the merchant did not include VAT in the sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and shipping.
If the recipient does not arrange the customs clearance themselves, a fee for the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
Tick one or two checkboxes, attach two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a five-minute question, says Neuheisl.
Not all packages are delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of international packages received at the post office in Prague has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, there is also a problem that people are not responding to requests for the data needed to complete the customs process.
Currently, there are 30,000 packages at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled out all the necessary information on time, we would be roughly halfway there, according to Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Solution to Inflation
How would you suggest a solution to the current inflation, based on the title?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and further growth is expected.
What do you think the government should do to slow or offset this growth?
English: Is this the way forward for you, seeing a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland for example?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where this is headed?
Prices are rising faster than wages, it is inevitable in my opinion that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (if you are an employee)?
I got a 2% raise this year, which is a joke, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run on the side while employed.
Could someone explain to me why convicted violent offenders are sent to prison for only 6 months?
This just doesn't make sense to me, how can a court sentence an animal to 6 months in prison just for them to do it again as soon as they get out.
Six months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the victim of rape may never recover from it.
Will this also deter potential future reporting of rape victims?
The man from Hrob "burned out" his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
The Man from the Grave unwittingly helped the guards to apprehend his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He had summoned her himself.
He went about it the long way.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
The police officers, after being called on the emergency line, arrived at the scene and were astonished when the alleged "robbed" person told them that he had made it all up so that the police officers would come to the scene.
In reality, he just wanted advice from the guards on how to file a report with the Czech Police.
During the identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the guards discovered that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant had been issued for her.
The case is being handled by the Czech Police.
English: Do the people here consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally the same, but I would be interested to hear your opinion.
I definitely agree with you about that, it's a shame that Churchill wasn't able to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can truly believe something without any evidence just because it could potentially bring benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case to be true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there are approximately, if I'm not mistaken, around ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should a person choose?
I would say it is fairly likely that among the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you harshly if you believe in a different god.
It is written in the Ten Commandments that there is no other god but Jehovah.
Wouldn't it be more rational in such a case to refrain from believing in any god, rather than risking to choose the wrong one out of thousands of gods and have the one true god I didn't pick send me to hell or some other similar place?
English: Voluntary training followed by placement in the reserves.
The Swiss model is similar, I think.
After X months of training in various specializations, and under the guidance of professionals with practical experience.
If one conducts oneself well, they may receive a professional offer.
All branches of the Czech Armed Forces would benefit from something like this.
It could be done in collaboration with the National Defense University.
We can talk about this: There is a constant emphasis on collaboration between the education sector and industry, companies are recruiting from schools and there is a kind of overlap where the workforce is migrating from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, transitioning from one field to another, etc.
Similar intermingling should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, the institution that guarantees that no Russian, German, or Mongol invader will ever enter here again.
It seems funny to me how you consider NATO to be carved in stone, we have allies and they will thus defend us if something goes wrong.
Do not displease the Lord.
It only takes one election in the US to cut their budget and send NATO to the trash.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that if we turn our backs on them, they will take whatever they want.
The only thing that consistently works as a guarantor of independence is a well-armed military and a population that is able to operate the military technology of its time.
Today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled devices, so why not?
We don't need border fortifications anymore, that's outdated now, but a tech-savvy teenager with a remote control device can handle it.
How to not drown in a box tsunami
You unpack the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home buried in boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is being reused by e-shops that are lacking packaging materials.
A map of stores that will accept your used boxes was created.
It's not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
It is a shame to treat them as disposable.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them) by agreement.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created, and avoid overflowing blue bins.
Single stores welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply in the market, as well as saved money, as packaging cardboard has increased by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One of these stores is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-friendly toiletries and cosmetics.
Boxes and packing material are delivered to Popůvky near Brno by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular deliveries of discarded cardboard.
We will use everything when packing orders from our e-shop.
Together, individuals and companies are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application also shows collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to drop off expired medicines, tires, used electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can end up in the right place, and reusable items can find a second home.
The project map in total contains over 100,000 such places.
Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the Ukliďme Česko app, adds that more and more collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs, and other places are being added, which help to find a use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily.
It seems wrong to me that in today's world technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone to play games don't learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently, there has been an issue (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the concept of folders on a computer.
Because apps like Google Photos or Apple Photos, or really any mobile phone, hide the underlying file system with folders and just put everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but mainly let them learn something.
Rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of France's EU presidency - starting in January - over the weekend and it was grand.
Macron spoke for an hour, during which he revealed the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be done in half a year.
French politicians like it and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters, straddling the right and left, agree on little, but on Europe they do.
There will be new elections for the head of state in France in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators rushed to criticize that Macron's aim was pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In reality, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
Extreme right-wing French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is currently touring France with the argument that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is having quite a bit of success with the French people.
Let's take Macron's idea of a single history textbook seriously and not focus on what's happening in France.
Wasn't it necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them, never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, and Czechs are learning who defeated whom in which battle.
If they don't have an enlightened teacher, they won't find out what the wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for directing and for Best Actress Jasna Duričičovou.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Film Festival, he held the top spots in the audience rankings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the movie The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was kind of like having the flu. I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really feel like smoking...
Compared to a regular flu, it was worse.
I do not have diarrhea with the flu.
This is only my personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone has it this way.
Christmas Book Recommendations
The Christmas double issue, which will be released on December 20th, will contain a traditional literary supplement.
Along with her, cultural tips will also come out.
We are attaching additional books to this digital edition for you, our subscribers, so that you have enough time to purchase books as Christmas gifts.

Trains are starting to run according to the new timetable, with some changes in operators in some places.
Starting Sunday, trains will be running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to run instead of Czech Railways.
In most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, possibly with a slight change in route.
On the railways there will also be dozens of new trains.
The transport companies started selling tickets during the autumn.
Czech Railways plan to operate an average of 6783 passenger services daily in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains daily.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers under the new timetable.
Trains in addition to domestic connections within the new timetable will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on routes from Prague to Cheb.
The transport company will be sending more new trains to Northern Moravia or Western Bohemia.
The transport company will also traditionally increase fares next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line from Ústí nad Labem to Mělník, Nymburk, and Kolín.
The carrier here will replace Czech Railways after their success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 services on the route daily, eight in each direction.
Further changes affect long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain similar timetables for its long-distance trains despite the planned maintenance work.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will be changed in some regional routes as well.
Changes await travelers, for example, in Česká Lípa, where instead of Czech Railways, Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the route from Mladá Boleslav to Rumburk.
Passengers will be able to use a unified fare for the railway for the second year.
The price of Czech Railways will increase by 3.2 percent due to inflation.
I must disagree.
Are we not learning to see things from another perspective?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work hard, and died.
In my life, I have never heard a lesson taught from the perspective of the slave-owners or from that time period; no one is defending it, only condemning it.
No one will tell you in school that black people often sold other black people into slavery and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one in school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from the Native Americans, they will only tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while they had been slaughtering each other for a long time.
I spent some time in the USA, both in northern schools and southern schools.
I have not encountered anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I have heard before that it happens and in my opinion it is a problem, which I do not deny (for example, war crimes from WW2 are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from a modern perspective, without understanding.
History does not care about someone's feelings, it is simply what it is and I think it is a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the matter from the perspective of that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
Incidentally, while we're on the topic of Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, but on the other hand, they also had some of their own successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Additionally, the North was not much better than it is idealized by many people today.
Many people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder and a lot of things were also opposed to them.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, lie and manipulate, plus our perspective doesn't even exist there (there was even a video on YouTube from a TV station where they cut off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found funny about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I felt that at some universities it was awful, the students were quite radicalized and the schools often supported them in that.
When I imagine these people being much older one day, it makes me a bit sick to think that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is present among the young and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has already achieved what it set out to do and it's no longer about the same thing, it has become more radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with feminism are labeling themselves as feminists and ignoring basic biological facts, as well as other groups such as LGBT, which leads to radicalization on both sides, often resulting in resistance even to quite reasonable things.
The more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I haven't encountered anyone who has condemned me for colonialism or slavery.
I think I just had a bad geography lesson, but it was mutual :D
English: Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Additionally, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If something connects me to people, it's interests, perspectives, and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
The Slovenian pastor is a really great guy, his sermons are usually more about theology than politics, but then he always throws in some nonsense about the coronavirus that makes everyone embarrassed.
English: Of course, here is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestant, but in reality they were born from Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholic without a Pope.
I know many people who are Catholic but attend services with the Hussites because it is theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
The Church of St. Michael on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even every Sunday at 3:00 PM they hold a mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem Candle is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria.
The Bethlehem Candle, lit in Bethlehem where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The Scouts were supposed to go to Vienna for him due to the coronavirus pandemic, but this time they didn't. In the morning, they received him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing.
They took her over the border last year too.
English: The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in with the troop every year, I'm really looking forward to it.
Amálie Budíková, a scout, said to the present journalists, "It is an honor for me to be chosen."
Last year, the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, but now it is taking place at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, the scouts take the train to Vienna for him.
Nothing is changing with the distribution of the flame across the Czech Republic.
The scouts set off traditionally by train with the Bethlehem light first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18th, Scouts couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, travelling by selected express and local trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them at the stations and then spread the flame further across the Czech Republic, even to places where the railway does not reach.
This year, scouts must adhere to the current measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It's going similarly to last year.
We recommend that both courier teams and local event organizers wear masks, maintain social distancing, keep their numbers to a minimum, refrain from singing together, and generally behave in the safest way possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship, and harmony along with the flame.
English: Bethlehem's Light is a symbol of hope for believers, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human mutuality.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come to get a candle, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I do not have an economic education, so I do not know the basics of economics which confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The money will be put to good use in the development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare, and education. I just don't understand why the money is being put into agriculture, industry, and businesses in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is being produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are millions of posters on the walls saying "xy funded/co-funded by project xy" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not support for a company that provides jobs for x people, this is a hindrance to development where this company is just barely holding on and taking away orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Absolutely agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person born in the internet age can get caught in some trick or trap - especially ads.
I think to myself that internet ads won't affect me, but then I still get caught out that they have influenced me - it's just so sophisticated now that you can't always avoid it.
For this reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to impose a complete ban on programmatic advertising...
It's all rubbish, to quote the classics - I would ban the internet.
I feel that this belief has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
I won't believe something that the majority believes and makes sense, I'm not a sheep after all, but I'd rather believe something that is less likely, doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I can claim is critical thinking.
"I won't believe everything the media says."
"I don't trust politicians."
Television has embraced the trend of Christmas movies, with two hundred premieres this year.
English: Los Angeles – In the United States and other English-speaking countries, television stations and streaming platforms have embraced the trend of Christmas movies and this year they will premiere a record-breaking more than two hundred of them for their viewers.
The operator of the IMDb movie database calculated it.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic movies has been scoring well with audiences in recent years and has significantly increased viewership, so more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were filmed than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb database only included movies with the word "Christmas" in their title, so there will actually be many more holiday films.
Movies traditionally associated with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated mainly with fairy tales, while globally popular films include Home Alone, It's a Wonderful Life, and the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
The real boom of Christmas movies didn't start until 2009, when the American cable television network Hallmark came out with a special film series, according to the BBC server.
Her Countdown to Christmas project, which included four films, was very successful.
This station began to get its viewers in the Christmas spirit as early as October 22nd and will feature a total of 42 Christmas movies.
Lifetime's competitor station has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its lineup this year, with popular streaming platforms like Netflix contributing to the total.
In this magical season, the story doesn't matter so much, what's important is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, jokingly described this genre.
English: "For viewers, it's a form of escapism and a way to feel a bit of peace for two hours amidst all the holiday madness and the madness of the world we've been living in for the past few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
Two people fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end, there is some misunderstanding that is resolved successfully and the two of them kiss.
Gray adds that this is how it goes all the time, and as long as all the movies look and feel the same, people watch one after the other.

Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not take part in the final race of the season.
Haas team will only send one Formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was aiming for a better finish than the 20th place he had earned in qualifying.
Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He had tested positive for COVID-19.
At the starting grid, only nineteen cars will appear, with Mick Schumacher from the last spot taking off on the track for Mazepin's team, and Max Verstappen from the first spot, who will compete directly with Lewis Hamilton for the title.
Mazepin is reportedly in good condition and showing no symptoms according to the Haas team.
Nikita is physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
Now she is in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not and cannot send a replacement driver to the race.
A potential substitute would have to qualify or race in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not dealing with COVID-19.
At the start of the just-ending season, Kimi Räikkönen had Covid-19, while Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton were tested positive last year.

Gold, silver, and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze you!
I'm sort of like a portable jewelry store and the creator put in half a year of work and all of their savings.
Liban admits that he had a vision of what he wanted to create, but he had little experience, as sweaters were not worn much at home. He spent 3000 hours on his work in the span of half a year.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-karat gold thread in France, and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by the Swarowski company.
He then decorated 150 diamonds with silver stars.
"The base is wool and cotton, but silk will give the sweater softness," praises the creator of the work, which however does not recommend washing.
English: There's still one more catch.
Liban admits, "I'm completely broke, I have to sell my sweater as quickly as possible."
If successful, it will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago was "only" 720,000 Czech crowns.

Is the Omikron mutation spreading in Southern Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
Currently, we have reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adam's, from the preparatory class.
"No direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Elementary School has been proven," said Ciupek.
Six cases have appeared in the region this week.
The director stated that we are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant for our six cases, which is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague.
She added that there were two nurses from one workplace at the Brno Faculty Hospital, two children of one of them, and two eleven-year-old students from the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, and four have an asymptomatic course.
No one with suspicion of Omikron traveled abroad.
None of them have traveled abroad, nor has anyone in their family, nor has there been any contact with anyone who has been abroad.
Ciupek stated that none of the listed people have any connection to the water polo championship.
The Chief Hygienist, Pavla Svrčinová, previously stated that an international water polo tournament held in Brno a few weeks ago is being investigated.
There were players from South Africa and one Belgian player who became ill after returning.
California will limit the sale of firearms.
I want to proceed like Texas with the abortion ban.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to implement a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain firearms in the most populous US state using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of a fetal heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to damages in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault weapons or homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to the Friday statement of the US Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in effect, despite it going against the nearly 50-year-old precedent set by the ruling that established the right to abortion nationwide up to roughly 24 weeks of pregnancy.
The Supreme Court was not ruling on the constitutionality of the law as a whole, but on a technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Enforcing the ban was in this case shifted to the public, thus disabling Texas Republicans from attacking it through the usual court route.
I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the preservation of Texas' ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," said the Governor of California.
"If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He reportedly tasked his subordinates to work with the state legislature and the Minister of Justice on measures that would empower public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
These homemade weapons, which do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations, are referred to as such.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) in damages and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault weapons, ghost gun parts, or kits for their manufacture in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," said the Governor of California.
The AP agency notes that California has been banning the production and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge here blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to now reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in her dissenting opinion to Friday's majority ruling warned against the expansion of this legal mechanism to other US states.
The Supreme Court nevertheless did not grant Texas' abortion ban full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue to sue certain officials of the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, where the vaccination schedule is gradually determined and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
Studies about the effects of four doses are already pouring in from Israel.
According to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule in due time, it's just too early for that right now.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, is expected to come to the market according to the manufacturer's specifications, promising up to 10 times greater effectiveness.

However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to switch TV and internet providers.
Poland threatened to stop payments into the EU budget.
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would have acted in breach of the law if it had used its new powers to suspend payments to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for the use of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The European Parliament is putting pressure on it to move forward and use a mechanism that allows for the removal of EU funding from countries that violate the rule of law.
Ziobro, the leader of the small party Solidarność Polska whose votes are necessary for the current government to maintain its slim majority in the Sejm, said that Poland should respond to this EU blackmail with a veto in all matters requiring unanimity.
Ziobro added that Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
His party takes a more radical stance on EU accession than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes made to the Polish justice system during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is setting "impossible conditions because his goal is not a rule of law but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing a "political dictate carried out through blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," also said Ziobro.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU based on partnership between sovereign states, rather than the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept any concessions from Brussels that would limit the sovereignty of Poland.
He declared, "We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony."
Trying to figure it out... At our Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I looked for the other things, I encountered yogurt multiple times too, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's for sure, in that narrow sector were all the chosen, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I have to avoid going to the supermarket, whether it's a sale or not, I'll go to the golden store on the square. They may not have as much selection, but they usually have everything I need and it's organized, so I can be done in ten minutes.
I went to Lidl to take a vacation.
I don't care anymore.
For two years I have been watching how data is handled here like manure, most anti-vaccinationists are just a little bit more off-base than most pro-vaccinationists.

They punished me with a spoon when I was a child.
It was never about grades, mostly it was just because I kept refusing to listen and misbehaving (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc).
I have never been punished without warning, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get a spanking (sometimes even after being "caught" again she would just bring the spoon and put it down so I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few spanks on the bottom (over clothing).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in a reasonable manner and degree) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than words.
English: I think the important part is the warning, because it gives the child a choice of whether to disobey and get punished, or to improve and avoid punishment.
It usually only took a warning for me to start listening in the end.
System Defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document to which one swears and is taught from childhood in school, or rather an agreement that can be changed if necessary - he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once we agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and to be careful with changes.
Imagine this: some nations actually like their rules.
Vojtěch Cepl jokingly commented that, just like Czechs love dumplings with pork and cabbage.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Czech Constitution needs to be changed has been increasingly appearing among lawyers.
Life is tested by situations that its creators (among them Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, such as the behavior of the directly elected president.
Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions into their texts must be thought out.
The institution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of rule of governance consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we are binding policies with prohibitions.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not discriminate, at FN Brno a few months old baby is fighting for its life.
Although it is known that coronavirus is usually milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
We know that children are less affected and endangered than adults, with 2 to 5 percent compared to adults, said Petr Dominik, Head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, to Novinky.
The course is usually much simpler and lighter, often without symptoms.
There are, however, pediatric patients who are severely ill with coronavirus, which we have seen particularly in recent times," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This is taking place at a pediatric infectious disease clinic.
Seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently being admitted to the ICU.
The children with post-COVID syndromes were on the ward continuously throughout the year according to the doctor.
Now there is an increase in children with acute COVID-19 pneumonia, which means pneumonia that requires a stay in an intensive care bed, said the doctor, adding that this disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and several-month-old infants.
In hospitals, there are also children in critical condition due to the coronavirus.
The head physician stated that currently there are children of both a few months old and adolescent age in our hospital.
She is nevertheless glad that no child deaths due to the coronavirus have been recorded at the FN Brno Children's Hospital so far.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 have died in the Czech Republic as of December 6th.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is an integral part of the cooperation in the children's hospital - not just in the coronavirus department.
It also warns that, just like in adults, vaccination in children reduces the severity of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
The doctor added, "Therefore, we recommend the vaccine dose for children as well."
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on the marked paths.
The calm zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally in national parks outside of the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the game reserve).
You are not allowed to ski/bike in the forest off marked trails anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course it is not monitored that much outside of national parks).
How does a conductor practice?
The music is playing in my head, Josef Kurfiřt is laughing.
I was raised on the Liberec Opera and originally played the horn.
As a singer, he can practically sing any repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the Liberec F. Šalda Theatre, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He is collaborating with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, or the Podkrkonoší Symphony Orchestra.
China is creating the impression of having the virus under control and that its authoritarian regime is better equipped to handle the crisis.
Jirouš Sinolog: China is creating the impression of having the outbreak under control and that its authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better.
China has launched a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was facing criticism for failing to contain the virus that has now become a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero new infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, including the worst-hit Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is this friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
English: A friend meets a friend and says to him: Hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because the goat grazes the grass, washes the car with its muzzle, and the children play with it.
English: That's just great.
I will sell you the elephant for 5000,- if you want.
Friend: Alright, let's high five, that'll be great...
After some time they meet again and the one who bought it complains: What the heck did you sell that for a elephant????
The lawn is trampled, there are giant piles of poop everywhere, the car is broken down, the kids are scared of it, and the wife wants to get a divorce.
He who sold it says: You speak badly of the elephant, you won't sell it like this...
World events are controlled by powers.
Despite the equality of sovereign states, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a superpower if it works on its integration.
This currently works on an economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15, or 20 years.
Maybe by the mid-century, the mood will be different and it will be successful.
I thought of that too and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm just playing with words.
I just assume that an ellipse usually includes two different units at the same level.
I will take an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is not clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
Additionally, I base this on the fact that the phrase "all American forces" includes their weapons and that I know American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad term and there is no need to further specify it for the US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just word-playing :D
English: Whether it is this way or that way, it is an unreasonable demand.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured a capuchin monkey named Milly.
The terrifying footage shows the moment a frightened monkey cowers in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushes it and laughs at it.
Holland fed the monkey hot dogs, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrates Court in Gwent has now banned the keeping of animals for life, according to The Sun newspaper.
The primate rehabilitation experts caring for Milly after her abuse stated that they had never seen a macaque so terrified.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation at Monkey World in Dorset and now she is happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
A quadruple mother admitted to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Magistrates' Court in Gwent, she was given a twelve-week custodial sentence suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals, and must pay 12,000 Czech crowns in court costs.
Steph Sawyer, the leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, said: "Milly is doing okay, but the rehabilitation will continue."
Milly took a while to get used to people again.
She shrank and hid from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Now that she has settled down and is content with her mate, her view of new people can still evoke panic in her.
Psychological scars from the abuse will stay with her forever, says Sawyer.
The abuse of Milly was revealed after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage on her phone during a raid on her apartment for drug charges.
In the footage, one can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
On the next video, you can hear Holland offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Lick my fingers.
In May, she admitted to possessing cocaine with her partner Russell Cox (43) with the intention of selling it.
In her house, cocaine worth 1600 pounds (approximately 50 thousand Czech crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
What amazing concepts will you learn from the prehistoric times if you bravely skip over the entire 20th century?
As a freshman, are you taking the same classes as in sixth grade?
The whole idea of rote memorization kills it, where nobody, with exceptions, cares if you know it or understand it.
Mainly write the test on 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Go out on the street and randomly ask people if they can determine the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients.
Everyone has gone through it, and the absolute majority won't even bat an eye and tell you they don't care at all.
What the hell are we learning for?
I am a big fan of general overviews and the reality is that people don't want and don't need them.
At that moment it is pointless and you will never get it into them anyway.
Partially it is learned for the multitude of people who will need it.
I really meant it when I said you don't need all this standing at the machine... ...because you really don't need it.
Additionally, we are slowly entering an era where not knowing is a sign of being cool.
However, the price of having barbarians in charge of these machines is simply too high, which is probably due to our communist past and the persecution of educated people and elites.
If journalists were able to count, then the Covid probably would never have reached these proportions here.
At first sight wedding: Kadrih and Andrea's war continues!

The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move there, at least until they returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
She resolutely refused that.
As it can be seen, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
Kadri angrily responded to Andreino's accusation of lying, gambling, and debt by exclaiming, "It was you who planned the attack!"
Kadri's alleged honesty did not please his younger sister Linda, nor his ex-wife.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally I don't express my opinion about these kinds of things and we never really talked about them much in my family.
I definitely don't want to evoke any pity.
When I see someone trying to publicly hurt and defame someone I care about so much, it just drives me crazy!
I'm sorry that I have to do this in this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for becoming a character and helping our family when we needed it the most, even at such a young age.
It saddens me even more when I have to read such false information, which is likely taken out of context.
I wish everyone could know Kadri like I, our close ones and family do, standing in testimony in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the truth and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's for.
Chao began his robbery spree in the parking lot of a residential neighborhood, attempting to break into several cars.
According to available information, a total of approximately 330 crowns were stolen from one vehicle.
He then couldn't think of anything better than to climb up to the 5th floor and climb in through the open window into the apartment.
He stole two bananas.
On the footage from one security camera, it is then captured how he walks away down the street from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he noticed that the bananas were not where they were supposed to be and he called the police.
Then Cchaa was arrested.
The man admitted that he had consumed alcohol on the incriminating day.
Due to needing money, he decided to rob in a drunken state.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to a state of pandemic readiness.
When it is repealed, the law will not be in effect.
The law restricts the scope of business.
Does that not suffice as a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters came out for the Sunday elections for the four municipalities' councils.
People in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovné in Pelhřimov voted for new councils on Saturday.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has dropped below the legally mandated number or the elected councils have dissolved.
A total of 28 mandates were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a relatively challenging but successful year for us.
Four new or repeat elections to municipal councils and especially the highly anticipated elections to the Chamber of Deputies were held, said Deputy Chair of the Czech Statistical Office Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In Komna, Uherskohradišťsku, the Association of Independent Candidates won the Saturday elections, receiving 27.76 percent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means the gain of two mandates.
Citizens for Komňu won two seats in the legislature, receiving 18.52 percent of the vote.
Again, the former mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, was elected to the council.
The Komňané – independent candidates have achieved one mandate in the legislature.
Seventy-five point forty-eight percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in Pelhřimov District, the Pro Rovná association won.
It received 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
Repeated elections in Lusatia in Mostecko were again won by the Lusatia and Svinčice Association led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the votes and, like in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The second-place candidate list, Obec pro lid, which received 43.27 percent of the vote, will have three representatives in the legislature.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
The independent candidates of Hope for New Village won the elections in New Village, Liberec region, ahead of the ANO Movement.
59.88% of voters voted for the association of independent candidates, resulting in them obtaining four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against regular elections in 2018, gaining one more mandate and having three in total.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the election results.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you already know all of this that people are writing here.
You're playing dumb just so you can have someone to argue with.
If not, that's sad.
I don't assert that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
Even from an aesthetic point of view, I like a lot of church buildings (which, after all, was the goal, to make them look good).
I really don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I am bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it hoarded, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, such as the Thirty Years' War.
TL;DR: Believe in a spaghetti monster if you want, but keep the state and church separate.
The man fell headfirst from twelve meters.
He survived the crash into the concrete.
Incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, for whom the rescuers of the Regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
Employees at the county's emergency operations center received an emergency call at one o'clock in the morning on Saturday with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two crews from the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) immediately arrived at the scene - one medical and one health care.
Upon arrival at the scene, medical personnel discovered that the 27-year-old man had fallen out of a window from a height of around twelve meters and landed head-first on the concrete!
Coal was mined in Vítkovice.
It didn't go as it should have, and the firefighters went into action.
When the teams of emergency services arrived, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of life.
The attending doctor intubated his airways, secured artificial lung ventilation, and after other measures taken as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava Trauma Center for further care, according to Lukáš Humpl, spokesperson for the ZZS MS region.
I have greater concerns than the coronavirus from the public and government's inadequate reactions.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic poses a challenge for politicians and officials, but it is primarily doctors and healthcare workers who are on the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We are asking Military Doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt.
MMA had an amazing night full of interesting results.
At UFC 269, things were happening.
Julianna Penova, an outsider, was able to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight division, he put on a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also recorded a victory, quickly knocking out Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprise that nobody expected.
The female bantamweight fight between the renowned Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena brought this.
An American entered the mutual battle as a proverbial "dwarf", as Nunes had not lost in seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The beginning of the match also followed the paper predictions.
Nunes started her journey to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, sending her to the ground.
Penny refused to be forced into any further mistakes and attempted to attack with a lever on her arm, but was unsuccessful.
The second round was thrilling and very suspenseful for MMA fans.
Both opponents exchanged many excellent punches and hard hooks.
The money fell out of Nunes' pocket and landed on the ground, where it started to strangle her.
She had to give up the effort and call off the attack.
An American woman gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier was doing better, but the tide gradually began to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, attempting to overpower his opponent with an arm lock.
He initially didn't do very well, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on their back and bombarded them with a series of strikes.
He won the second round because of that.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke which Poirier resisted for a while, but eventually had to tap out.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley secured a resounding victory, landing a hard right back on Rauliana Paiva in the first round.
He then knocked him down with a series of precisely aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth victory.
Kara-France was able to help Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her young daughter, but now after seven years she has lost.
Which knee, yours or mine?
At first glance, it's not anything complicated.
Most Czech nouns express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem determining whether it is masculine, feminine, or neuter.
There is also a relatively large group of nouns here, for which the gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When declining, they take on two endings and in some cases remain in the infinitive form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are of both masculine and feminine gender; the former is declined according to the pattern of "stroj" and the latter according to the pattern of "píseň".
In another group of nouns, there are different forms in the first case of the singular, for example: "řádek/řádka", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are correct, have the same meaning, and are therefore interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case the Moravian variant is ungrammatical, similarly with other Czech-Moravian word pairs: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally not inflected, but gradually they are adopting Czech endings.
An example of this is the word "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained in the neuter gender, but in the masculine it has endings according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like at the Greek borders?
At the Greek-Turkish border, tension is rising due to the increasing number of migrants attempting to make their way further into Europe.
Thousands of people began heading to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them from doing so.
European politicians are promising Greece support, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What exactly motivates refugees to take the uncertain journey?
What does the situation look like on the ground?
We haven't seen a blue sky in three months and we have been suffocating, describes a journalist from Sydney.
Destructive bushfires, which Australia has been dealing with for the past four months, have killed nearly thirty people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the citizens themselves coping with the disaster?
Could the Morrison government have done more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics claim?
What will countries have to prepare for in the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with a journalist from Sydney, Ikou Detrichovou.
False accusations have always been and are still quite rare.
Everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is uncomfortable for people to address how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to silence it.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
I know many people who have been raped and I have experienced how their environment or even the police often treat them.
Victims should always be believed.
English: There is a trend now that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
People still keep it to themselves too much.
There are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting to spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large portion of accusations are fabricated" and that it is a "trend" you are only helping sexual predators.
Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families don't have money to complete them.
The prices of building materials have increased by more than 30 percent in the last weeks and months.
Many people got into a difficult situation because of this.
She does not have the means to finish the unfinished family homes and banks are refusing to increase her mortgage loans.
The cost of construction work is also increasing in addition to the cost of materials.
People therefore do not have enough money to finish already partially constructed family homes.
In many cases, banks are refusing to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely uncomfortable situations.
In the best case, people move into unfinished and unapproved houses.
In the worst case, the unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgages and rent at the same time," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We will build two to three family houses next year and fifty percent of it has been done.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to adhere to certain things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we're doing it without a salary," said Zdeněk Slivoň, owner of the construction company.
Many people will soon have financial problems.
If they had counted on the house construction costing five million, now it will cost seven.
I think some will wait and see," added Slivoň.
The materials that increased the most in price were copper, iron, and also plumbing and heating equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is being hindered by the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuance of building permits is currently more favorable.
The building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than last year, Křeček specified.
We are doing well and we will be doing even better.
The real vision is missing, says the commentator of Czech Radio - mujRozhlas.
Entering the new year, in addition to the usual celebrations, political speeches have traditionally accompanied it.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the nation was addressed by the chairs of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What have we learned that is significant?
I think the diploma thesis is great because I get to choose my own topic, build on my bachelor's thesis, and work on it for a whole year before writing the written part in a week or two.
State exams are completely relaxed here, unless the person is a total fool and nothing has stayed in their head, then the commission won't unnecessarily suffocate them with theory.
I had been studying for the state exam for a week and when I was stuck, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical deduction which I immediately understood and had the answer right.
As for those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we've done it a lot, it's really beneficial, you learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're set.
In my opinion, it's great when at the end of the subject there is an exam that tests the knowledge gained through the project, not just a defense.
Everything is okay but don't overwhelm emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You will be just as much of a coward as they are.
People at the embassy don't have to have anything to do with it.
If they were against Russia, they would be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something bad could happen to them.
Sure, you can put up a similar statue of Putin next to the Teddy Bear statue.
Maybe give it to him so that it reaches up to Xi Jinping's backside or something like that.
I agree, even though Instagram is throwing obstacles in the way of artists.
Once you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to a minimum.
Additionally, they keep changing which function is more important, whether it's a like, comment, or save.
I've been really annoyed by it lately, so I might have to resort to TikTok, where a lot of artists from my industry have been successful and can't seem to get enough of it.
English: I would even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement of the Working Party of Donbass
The protesters in the picture are expressing their opposition to the dissolution of the Soviet Union - yes to the Union, no to dissolution.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the Soviet Union.
On December 8th, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, secretly and without regard for the people, with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's open indulgent attitude, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
The dissolution of the Soviet Union left tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of non-Russian populations in the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars combined!
The same people who destroyed in one sitting what had been built over the previous seventy years in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, and detached fourteen republics that had previously been economically connected in a single mechanism from the world's greatest power.
If we look even deeper, we see population impoverishment, economic breakdown, science, military, rise in criminality, inter-ethnic conflicts, war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of Orange Revolutions, NATO expansion to the East, war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, Arab Spring, war in Syria - all of this is a result of geopolitical capitulation, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum".
Everything that was hastily abandoned and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries, which accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
The whole world is still shaken mainly due to the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a high-volume supermarket does not necessarily correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK per kilogram.
I will buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making dinner out of it on Thursday.
In an alternative reality where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the supermarket chain discounts it to 99 Kč/kg on Tuesday - can you describe the mechanism by which this change in the price of the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system?
I could wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 Kč/kg, one day before the expiration date - how would this meat be different from the one I bought on Monday for 120 Kč more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I will answer myself - nothing.
These jokes about how if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled, or low quality are really stupid, to be honest ;-)
Recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the girls were handing out some brochure, I always take similar things to help out the volunteers, they can't throw it away...
No, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I had a feeling that it was going to be some kind of propaganda.
After reading, I found out who published it and it turned out to be Scientology.
No, even though it was good advice, full of completely unnecessary lessons, like washing myself and not being naughty.
It's a shame about the paper, the rainforests wouldn't have to be cut down for this.
I experienced something similar with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with that person because you care about them without realizing how messed up the situation is.
She threatened me multiple times that she would hurt herself because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
Or, when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started to cry and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
She then began to physically block the door.
English: For about a year, it was a great relationship, but then another half year passed and it started to go downhill.
I then ended the relationship by telling her that we were breaking up and lying to her that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and prevent her from going into a rage.
Such a person will suck the life, emotions, and joy out of you.
Keep your distance.
When insurance companies are recklessly buying up cloud tests and rushing to find positives, who would not have known about this terrible disease without the test.
The only thing we are achieving is complications for companies, carriers, and others due to their employees receiving five days of home confinement in the random number generator.
In the West, they have stopped with the foolishness and acknowledged that it is not worth trying to solve a sickness weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still needs to steal something and boost his ego by inventing nonsense.
I see that our old friend the scoundrel is back again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this shady business, MLM recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman in college), the initial promises of product training and sales skills quickly shifted to "you don't need to worry about that, just get people".
Honestly, I was interested in the products I was offering since I wanted to help people, however the training was more about scaring and coercing people.
When the first earned money came, one quickly realized that if they wanted to make money, they had to sell a certain number of products each month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only sources of income, so one felt like a door-to-door salesman of pots and pans.
English: All I can say is that it was a valuable experience, one learns not to jump on every piece of information and to verify it thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone into one bag.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't be boasting about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
In the corporation where I work, I haven't experienced many of these things.
HR is at peace, managers are looking after their own management and they don't stick their noses into anything.
Regular evaluations are happening somehow, in the form it is conducted here it goes quite well (set some goals for the next year, look at what worked and what didn't after a year) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you based on numbers or something similar.
Company events are also optional.
We are somewhat unique even within our own company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes one has the feeling that we are like a almost-startup, squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
It works like this: they don't bother us much as long as the results are good.
Czech missing person in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police have been searching unsuccessfully for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12th, Acting Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradištsko had been found dead.
The British police unfortunately confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they have found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
In consideration of the family, we will not be providing more information about the case.
Kulhánek expressed his sincere condolences on Twitter.
The last time the young woman was seen was on November 28th in the bus while travelling from work, she was supposed to pick up money from the ATM before boarding.
Her colleagues reported her disappearance five days later.
Following her, the London police began to search for her, Interpol listed her as missing worldwide.
She was also found in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police in this context arrested a man several days ago.
What role did he play in the case and what is he suspected of, but not revealed?
At the end of the year, new councils were elected in four towns.
On Saturday, December 11th, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsku, Lužice in Mostecku, Nová Ves in Liberecku, and Rovná in Pelhřimovsku.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has dropped below the legally mandated number or the elected councils have dissolved.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates competed for 28 mandates.
The voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters cast their ballots.
Eight women and twenty men were elected.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
For the new elections to the councils in the four mentioned municipalities, a total of 13 candidate lists were registered.
There were 36 women and 63 men competing for 28 representative positions.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a relatively challenging but successful year for us.
The elections held in it included four new or repeat elections for municipal councils and most notably the highly anticipated elections for the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to mostly work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which required more equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed on Sunday, December 12th at 3:49 AM.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the voting results and, after approval, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a fairly dangerous infectious disease here at the very beginning, but it went without much trouble.
I still have difficulty coming to terms with how stupidly a large portion of the population at all levels has reacted to this.
I'm most excited for the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on other people not being jerks.
He was removed from the office of President and disqualified from being able to regain it.
The chance that it will actually happen is, as others here have mentioned, very small.
Additionally, I am not sure if the destruction of the file could be considered a crime.
Velezrada is an act by which the president of a republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must be something more serious.
English: How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who have gone without sex for a whole year is increasing.
More and more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
This mainly concerns religiously-minded people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sexual activity increased from 8 to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported not having had sexual intercourse in the last year are more than ever before.
The decrease in the number of sexually active individuals is also contributed to by other factors, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
She could also contribute to the presence of media, social networks, or video games, which make sex a lower and lower priority for young people.
Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the past year has been rapidly increasing, according to research by IFS Lyman Stone.
People in marriages have more sexual activity; in 2021 only 5% of them reported being without sex in the last year.
Among free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Decreased sexual activity is also attributed to fear of premarital intercourse and religious beliefs.
Despite the higher likelihood of married couples being sexually active, the percentage of married people under the age of 35 is still decreasing.
Young people's opinion on premarital sex is divided, with about 30% thinking it is a bad thing, while around 70% think it is okay.
"It is true that free individuals in this age group are a minority, but their behavior is pushing this trend," Stone speaks of these thirty percent.
Most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex have a religious basis for it.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence among unmarried people under 35 who attend religious gatherings more than once a month has increased from 20 to nearly 60%.
Stone stated that the trend among the "less religious" has risen from 10 to 20%.
The decrease in sexual activity is also contributed to by other factors, such as less social interaction and mainly social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
Study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower for people without jobs or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, replacing this need.
This trend gained traction mainly during the lockdown period of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole debate about vaccinating against COVID is about whether society should force a portion of the population to do something they don't want to do, but which could save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether it would be our fault if we don't order it for them and they die.
My argument is that we could certainly be held accountable for the death of an eighty-year-old person who really didn't know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a staunch anti-vaccination advocate who was here shouting alongside the SPD and the Communist Party about bullying and totalitarian states.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be clearly inferred that most of the unvaccinated seniors probably belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Ski resort operators cannot do without artificial snow, and the weather can complicate the preparation for the Jizerská Padesátka cross-country skiing race.
Is this a trend or an exception?
What will a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about a religious person.
Once in middle school, our teacher took us on a field trip across the city to the boat dock so we could go boating on the river.
On our way there, we went down this quite wide street and who do we see in the middle - devotees of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they descended upon us.
I luckily escaped, but one of my friends got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had said to them.
Ask me if I want to save my soul.
I told them I don't have a soul," she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, was laughing the whole way to the boat dock.
We are terribly spoiled.
Orozovič says, "We expected so much, but the system is already collapsing."
English: On Sunday, new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honors, following his previous visits to Paris and Brussels.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept any violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The Chancellor believes it is advisable to address the crisis, caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, through diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy Group" comprising France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he informed the Chancellor about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially created a migration crisis and is using people as living targets and weapons, because we are recording hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border every night.
He negotiated with the Chancellor about further sanctions in order to make Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the Eastern border of the EU.
Scholz assured the DPA agency that Germany is supporting Poland in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of Lukashenko's regime towards refugees.
A drunken Polish nun caused an accident and tried to hide it.
The car eventually returned to the scene of the accident, but it was now being driven by a different nun who was trying to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for failing to yield and fleeing the scene of the accident, she came clean, according to TVN24 station.
She admitted that she had hit another nun who had asked her for help with the vehicle.
The police came for Celestina's sister.
They administered a breathalyzer test to her and, after finding out that she had over two parts per thousand of alcohol in her blood, they immediately revoked her driver's license.
They simultaneously informed her that she would be confessing her actions in court.
Hugo is doing his best.
Juraj Šajmovič did not keep an eye on his movie.
Czech creators of family comedies were inspired by American stories about canine companions.
They forgot, however, the most important thing: the laws of the film craft.
After the kitschy film F. Brabec's Gump - The Dog Who Taught People to Live, another movie, Here We Guard, is now vying for audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-writer and director of the screenplay, Juraj Šajmovič Jr., continues his previous film, Tady hlídám já, from 2012.
Hugo the talking dachshund returns to the scene, along with some familiar characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a Bavarian pension that is struggling, start to invite dog owners, Julie's father and his partner, and most importantly her daughter Veronica.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who is experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Shajmovich (who is also the producer of the film) had already struggled with storytelling techniques in their previous dog movie, but at least that one entertained kids and the dog.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script, which elicits a mix of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's summarize.
Julie, a scientist, succumbs to superstitious beliefs in her desire for a child and, if the right "constellation" comes, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever the coordinates determine - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during a tour with a local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite his long training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which she is taken to the hospital by her family, so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Bohemian forest with the help of a dog.
Nothing compares to the cleansing power of nature and the strength of animal companions.
Their owners know why they have them.
The audience is amazed at how much of a convoluted plot full of unbelievable situations and characters was necessary to convey this message.
Two thieves from the staff, a dog show competition, a Bavarian charlatan, police officers arriving on a tip to search for "drugs" and discussing herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal - and which crazy family of course gets drunk in the pension.
When the heroine wakes up from a long coma and immediately sits at the family table, curled and made up with a cigar, demanding her father's whisky and steak as a cured vegetarian, it's impossible not to laugh.
The creators then explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Shaimovich's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to construct meaningful situations, a sense for character development and the punchline, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are uneven, the editing is helpless, and the overall impression is muddled.
No matter how hard Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková, or Nela Boudová try to keep their party going, they don't have much to play with.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the Bohemian Forest by cameraman Vladimir Holomka and the pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot, and dog puns, let alone the more colloquial vulgar expressions that the characters indulge in.
The argument is not even long-term membership in the Dachshund Club - as in the case of the producer lady.
To promote good intentions of nature and the friendship between man and dog, one must have knowledge of the craft in order to tell a believable story.
It didn't work out in this case.
There is too much eroticism and too little sentiment for the genre in this good family movie.
This amateur-style piece would not pass as an advertisement for canine therapy.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here it is seen how little you understand it, but that is only because you have never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you kept listening to those kids all the time, you might change your opinion.
It's a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only season of the year when it rains.
The Israeli Meteorological Service confirms that "the almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have recorded at some stations, is unusual."
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of the long-term average rainfall for November.
The two days of rain this week were more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
Wasim Aškar, a resident of Nazareth, was delighted with the perfect Christmas setting.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is sporadic and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, has been filled to the brim this spring due to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been decreasing.
Water managers have been warning about drought for a long time.
In 2018, Uri Schor, a spokesperson for the Israeli Water Authority, predicted that "depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a decrease in precipitation here."
Israel is able to help itself with technologies such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
Economically weaker countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are in worse shape.
In the streets of the Jordanian capital, Amman, there is an increasing number of water tankers.
Private wells and water pipes are drying up.
Imád Sulejman, a tanker truck driver, reported in September that orders had increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes have broken out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The local riverbed was completely dry.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran.
Israeli Defense Minister declared that the Vienna talks did not bring "any progress" and that he informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz on Saturday declared that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, according to Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to persuade Americans to ramp up their pressure on Iran, but also informing Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had not made "any progress" and that the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing games with them".
About 3 years ago, this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she really wanted from me.
Finally, I found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these tricks, I kept questioning the girl for a while and eventually thanked her and left.
English: Tell me I'm wrong, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains over the weekend, expecting plenty of snow and nice weather.
Ski resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the work week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have opened due to this.
Skiers were not deterred by the requirement to show a Covid certificate at the lifts.
While ski lift operators are not complaining about lack of customers, some ski equipment rental shops are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the pandemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to running tracks and ski slopes over the weekend.
Skiers were blessed with the weather today, offering both sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
We are pleased, the opening weekend really worked out from the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,“ praised the interest of the director of the Ještěd Sports Area Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend of skiing of the new season.
Ski Arena Karlov and the resort in Branné in Šumperk were among those open.
The weekend turnout was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branné, did not spare praise.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or within the period of recovery from COVID-19.
Except for a few exceptions, people are prepared for it and provide the necessary documents, said René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center to CTK.
He added, "We have only recorded a few incidents."
Some rental shops and ski equipment stores are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
Alexandra Bokišová from Skiopava in Opava said that it is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers.
Expect a higher demand during ski courses.
The director of the Královéhradecká company Snowbear, David Šinták, also feels that due to Covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
Before this pandemic, we were almost ready to be loaned out.
Šinták told CTK that compared to the period before the pandemic, they are at about 50 percent.
People have become lazy according to him and have learned to stay at home due to the pandemic.
The rental shop in the Novako area in Boží Dar has seen a high demand.
They started renting out skis there a week ago and now interested parties have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent out skis this weekend, but people have already been calling ahead so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the facility manager.
She says there is also interest in ski school comparable to the period before the pandemic.
If we want successful and wealthy people to stay in the country, they must have the opportunity to experience a quality life here as they would abroad.
Definitely not included in that is socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people are leaving the country with no possessions.
The owner of the company won't just leave for abroad so easily.
I completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not have a good life in the Czech Republic and if they do not have a reasonable vision of the future in the Czech Republic, then they will not stay in the Czech Republic.
Hungarian emigration began when one beautiful day, Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
English: Another question is, are there even elections?
If we live stupidly here, then some traditional V4 crazy person can also win here.
Young and educated people will leave, leaving behind his supporters and people whose wealth cannot be stuffed into an airplane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer has a bet on beer with blood?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the cast and crew of the movie Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), were enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor then posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for filming?
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
Lucy O'Connor from the Lambeth police department, where Petra worked, said in a Saturday video, "Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are starting to worry about her."
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is, she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 PM on Sunday, November 28th and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant to nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
We have immense concerns for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing, stated the group of healthcare facilities in a Twitter post.
We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help her to find to contact the police, the statement continued.
Harriet Harman MP is calling on the public to cooperate in the case of the Staggers, which she highlighted at a press conference on Saturday.
She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, and her parents are understandably worried to death, said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
Harman said, "I feel we all have an especially big responsibility to try and find her, as she was away from her home country, away from her family, and working here for our healthcare."
Police previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
That is not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our presence.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made you conclude that Russia wants war.
War is damn expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparing the situation in 1938 is so different in so many ways that I don't even know where to begin.
I can now compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that would correspond to that "concentration" at the borders.
English: Agreed, promises must be kept...
In Prague, new timetables will take effect on Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
Passengers in Prague's Integrated Transport (PID) will face several changes from Sunday, mainly concerning suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed their route, and others have been discontinued.
Mladoboleslavsko is now being integrated into the system.
In the capital city, express trains from České Budějovice stop at Zahradní Město station on Sundays.
In suburban rail transport, S7 trains will depart, which travel on the route from Beroun to Český Brod passing through Prague Main Station.
At the recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station, the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will now be stopping.
PID is now expanding into other areas.
Buses will also go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be integrated into the Mladá Boleslav region, including lines extending into the Liberec and Královéhradecký regions.
During integration, 77 lines will be discontinued, 37 new lines will be introduced, and the operation of 12 existing lines will be adjusted.
From Prague Zličín, a new bus line 405 will depart, going all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovnik has been created, replacing the discontinued S53 train line.
In the morning rush hour and on weekends, there will be increased connections from Prague to Rakovnik, with a new express line number 404.
Newly, lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region have been included in the PID system.
They are departing from the Střížkov Metro station, not from the Holešovice Train Station.
The 400 backbone line runs through Mělník, Dubou, and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor, and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The supplemental line 410 runs through Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimoně and Jablonné v Podještědí.
The operation of ten local lines in Central Bohemia has been newly cancelled or restricted, including to Mochov, Dobříš and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to railway modernization, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague-Beroun, Prague-Lysá nad Labem, and Kolín area lines.
Changes await travelers at other locations as well.
Buses are replacing some of the cancelled railway lines or extending the section on line 420 from Dobříš with connections from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region have been adjusted.
Healthy lunch/snack to the office from the supermarket.
Hi, I'm doing the usual 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option for getting food is to go to Billy next door or a bit further to Lidl.
Since I have no physical activity, I don't have the energy to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and diet-conscious as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I'll just buy pizza bagels and for a snack yogurt and an apple.
Answer: I would recommend buying fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains from the supermarket without needing to be cooked.
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately.
It's not about the trees that you have to necessarily see.
Under the snow, only the tip of a tree can be hidden.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I won't say that it's the only reason why they forbid us to go off-piste, but it is one of them.
English: I was not looking forward to this at all regarding my relationship with Nedved.
The Czech showbiz pond has been living nothing else since Friday than the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to her fans, explaining why she kept her love a secret from them for half a year.
I dare to say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who has not heard that Dara caught a bear, excuse me, Nedved,” jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
They say he wooed her, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they do not take joy in it.
Here it is.
We both weren't looking forward to it, but we knew it would come eventually, the singer continues.
I just don't know who is worse off.
Whether it's those who don't care at all and it jumps out at them even from a can, or us whose lives are dissected in detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your spouse or partner are a good match, or if you insisted that everyone should know a detailed list of your ex-partners and be aware of your mistakes and errors.
That's the way it is, that's what you want, it bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rollins was going for the preparations of her new fashion collection.
Nedved has been working as vice president of the Juventus football club for a long time.
They only went public with the truth now because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
Ivan and his wife have been separated for three years, officially they are not together but it has only been three weeks.
English: We thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
I love my new man and just as he stands by me, I stand by him too. In good times and bad, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have already said everything important, I just want to confirm that dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two and then found apartments together, which I think is the best option because you know who you will be living with.
Most apartments are not advertised too far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it won't hurt to take a look at the offers.
Avoid not only Cejl, but also its surroundings (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
In contrast, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and that direction is nice, plus it's close to most of the faculties of VUT (I don't know which one you're enrolling in exactly).
I've never looked for a rental before, but I'm a native of Brno, so I can possibly help with Brno as a whole if you need any more information :)
That's an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Due to the decision made by several doctors somewhere in Poland, it is actually okay that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they can learn whatever they want and pay for it themselves, or they can follow the state curriculum and have the state pay for it.
We cannot let a private actor take control of a piece of the education system just because they add a few coins to the full state contribution and will be able to teach whatever they want in the schools.
Such a claim loses some of its weight when it is written by someone who two days before expressed themselves in support of a boycott of a totalitarian state.
So a vote against someone getting an abortion is the same to you as a vote against a statue standing in a town square?
I would consult directly with the person who assigned you the job about this.
I have experienced in cataloging/digitizing that even long-time professionals either guess or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case it is quite readable, so I wouldn't really recommend it.
Personally, I would deal with it in a note depending on what program you are using.
If you want to be a diligent and hardworking student, you can look into some sign databases and find the closest one.
Because it looks like you're drawing from some book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol that matches what is physically on the coin.
English: Isn't it the Odrysian Empire (Kingdom) rather than OdryNská?
Someone has already solved it here for you.
Look at this comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians don't know what will be the "topic" of our presidency.
That is a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea of approving something because no one understood some text is comical.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, that is a matter for lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and interpreters work, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing extra-standard relationships.
Additionally, it is quite interesting with English, after the UK's departure from the EU.
I don't understand the hate for Cejl.
I have been working there for three years now and it's going great.
I go from work at 10pm and never have any problems.
Only someone who has never been there can say that it is a ghetto.
Yes, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't :D Definitely not something to be afraid of going out on the streets at night.
So if you're looking for relatively affordable housing with good access to the city center, I'd definitely go for it.
There are now a lot of apartments newly renovated or newly built there.
Felix Slováček (78) is all alone without his beloved Gelemová, just like a stick in the mud!
Who will you spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dády's wreath and I'm sure Lucie has one too, said Blesk's saxophonist, confirming Patrasová's words that she often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda stayed alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently we met up with Anička, Felix, and both of their grandchildren.
English: VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Even though we still talked, Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I am buying gifts gradually and I will definitely buy something for Dad and Lucia, maybe a perfume.
Felix said he was a gentleman as he arrived alone to the music video launch party at Richman club.
I am here alone, but I don't feel alone.
Slováček claims that he always finds someone to have a good time with, and he was glad to have met Luďek Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltovou.
He made it clear.
Are we an Island so that we can afford to not have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot not to occupy this territory.
I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, can you explain it to me?
I don't know of any other folder that could be deployed in hospitals during a crisis.
There are not enough police officers and they cannot afford it, the same goes for firefighters and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of health-trained people at such a level.
It is our army's capability to defend just Ostrava that goes against the previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for quite a while.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
The agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the countryside should not just be a food factory, says the journalist.
Czech Republic is going through its worst period of drought in recent years.
Scientists have reported a decrease in water in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas, and even places where there was previously no shortage of moisture are recording lower amounts of rainfall.
The cause of the drought that is prevailing in much of Central Europe is climate change.
The impacts are also intensified by the way we manage the soil.
What should I prepare for in relation to a drought?
How can we help nature in these difficult times?
English: Well, I can barely stay on my skates on the ice, let alone know how to play hockey and the tactics (that I tried out in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also a total mess.
Whether you are the hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Llama China", losing by two goals when you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when the score is tied.
Anyways, listening to Czech commentators pointing out what the referees pay attention to or don't pay attention to, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's just how it is with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsports like F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
In my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be like always, and since Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would be the classic "they lost" vs "we won".
The number of coronavirus infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million.
On Saturday, December 11th, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily cases.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people have died in the Czech Republic, with an additional 74.
In the Czech Republic, there have been 1967 confirmed cases per 100,000 in the last 14 days and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases have been recorded.
This is the lowest daily count since October 13th.
Total number of registered cases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, which is the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
England is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omikron, said Dr. Susan Hopkinsová, the Chief Medical Adviser to the British Health Safety Agency, on Sunday in a television interview.
It will be necessary to implement new quarantine measures.
People infected with Omikron are already being hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects the number to increase.
So far, no one has died from Omikron, however hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
The leader of the British Labour Party, Keir Starmer, stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson likely broke the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street in December last year, when a lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of Johnson's government defended that the quiz was held "virtually", via computer.
However, groups of employees gathered around computers participated in Downing Street.
In the UK, there is increasing pressure to remove Johnson from the position of Prime Minister.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties in defiance of the lockdown.
The British public and media are outraged that Johnson and his government have been making a mockery of them.
Paul Brand, editor of commercial television ITV for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a resounding majority in the general election.
Today morning the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the position of Prime Minister.
Amazing how quickly events have unfolded.
Do you want to turn the tables and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting spring elections that could end Viktor Orban's twelve-year rule.
These will be elections of European-wide significance.
How much can we expect fairness?
It won't be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán weren't either.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes electoral boundaries to their advantage, and does other small or large tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can choose where they want to vote in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to move voters from decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that there won't be any fairness at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is significantly different.
English: Previously, it was not a question of whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the unified opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
That is a big shock for Viktor Orban and his party.
Won't they try to maintain power by playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of the Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, leaked to independent media in which he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Is that the hints of a new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of the new items.
Everything starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and I used to get so angry when I was little that I would lie on the ground in a spasm and turn blue. They had to take me under the shower twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they scolded me in a disciplinary way, sometimes it was more like they didn't know what else to do.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now, as a kid I used to fight quite a bit, now I just punch something to let out my anger and when I was younger I would maybe slap my parents' hand (so I wouldn't get a spanking), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it is my explosiveness, but certainly my upbringing has a part in it too.
I'm afraid I'm going to start losing patience with my kids and handle it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration. On the other hand, maybe every parent messes up something, so it's probably impossible not to spoil your children at least a little bit, so I don't blame them for it.
It doesn't offend me at all, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would thus call you those who create laws of such quality.

Kočner's Monstrous World.
Has Slovakia advanced the process with the killers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial in the process of the four defendants accused of murdering Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová is beginning.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She mobilized civil society, but also uncovered the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What will the process mean for Slovakia as a major breakthrough?
For this, journalists are hugely responsible.

Another government is ending and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage sites is nowhere to be found.
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be drastically revised.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at an end and the law that was meant to ensure the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected when selecting and permitting a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Government Legislative Council has suspended the discussion of the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
His content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments are expecting a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers regarding storage facilities, as promised to mayors since 2011 when the first work on this legislation began, as required by the Czech Atomic Act and European Directive.
We expect that the new government will revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law proposed by Minister Karel Havlíček, which Platforma has available, is criticized by municipalities mainly for: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of selecting a location for the repository is inadequate and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Truly effective can only be if communities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location.
The obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the affected municipalities prior to initiating a specific procedure can be secured by storing it.
The presented draft of the substantive plan almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens of the municipalities practically just statistics in the permitting process.
The proposal lacks a system of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of site selection, permitting, and operation of the storage facility.
Representatives of municipalities do not have many options to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for a storage facility under current legal standards.
Only in certain permitting proceedings can people submit their comments or appeal, however it is the authority or minister in whose interest it is to issue the permit that decides.
A lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the carrying out of exploration or construction works.
The devolution of decision-making to local authorities, which the Platform is requesting, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries and certainly in those that have already progressed in permitting repositories, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is yet another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was entered into by SÚRAO and following contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for this work is to be almost 4 million crowns according to the contract registry.
Antonín Seknička, the Deputy Mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek area and spokesperson for the Platform Against Deep Storage, said: After the Industry Ministers, who only pushed off the equalization of the position of local governments to state authorities in the search for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Association of Towns and Municipalities, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental construction similarly as the directly affected municipalities in the selected locations.
The Platform against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to advocate for a change in the state's approach to dealing with spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision to select a location for potential disposal should be conditional on the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
John Goodman (69) was motivated to lose weight out of fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, eventually he was scared by doctors.
They told him that if he doesn't lose weight, he will die.
It took away.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kilograms, according to The Sun newspaper.
He boasted about his new character at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
The character from the sitcom Roseanne is completely different now!
John enjoyed joking that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his large body caused furniture to crack.
The actor said in an interview with AARP in 2018, "I put everything in my mouth."
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC that he is getting to an age where he can no longer afford to sit still.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, such as a university text, I would probably look for ways to describe or explain the boss more precisely.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
Maybe games like Dark Souls have several bosses, right? So "boss" is something like the ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
English: Are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses but the player never directly fights them (Tentacle, Gargantua), even able to be called bosses?
And then there are mini bosses.
English: It is impossible to translate the word "boss" into one word in any language, including Czech. (Catalan is an interesting exception, as it translates "boss" as "final enemy").
It is simply a significant, computer-controlled, stronger-than-all-previous-ones antagonist that guards the completion of some level or task for a story or game in general.
The whole world is searching for the missing Peter from London.
The Czech police have also become involved.
The British police have been searching for missing Peter Srncové since December 3rd.
The Czech police also joined the search.
They are looking for a 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko since December 7th.
Through Interpol, the British police are also helped.
Czech Petra Srncovou was last seen by her colleagues on November 28th.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called Yellow Notice for her.
The whole world is searching for Peter.
Czech Police is closely cooperating with British Police, confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
She added, "We are sharing information about the case together."
The search for Peter that was announced has now appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin, has brown eyes and long, straight hair of the same color.
She should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Harriet Harman, the local MP, also joined the search for Peter.
She got involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
She said at the Saturday press conference, "We are very worried about her."
In connection with the disappearance, British police have arrested one suspect.
It is not clear who it is and what he had to do with Petra.
Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla before Christmas.
Data in October showed a slight decrease in attack campaigns, but last month as the year came to a close, attacks significantly increased.
We recorded a major campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
An infected attachment in an email is designed to grab the user's attention with a title that references payments and financial transactions.
Last month, the dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its title, but this time it was labeled as "Copy of Receipt for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
English: Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
Malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which are then sent to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the end of August and beginning of September, and with the approaching holidays and end of the year, attackers' activity is rising again.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security specialists in November detected more of a global-reaching campaign.
In comparison to October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly one fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th, and 15th of November.
The formbook usually contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
The term "receipt" still appears.
Attachment in Czech can be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have noted a significant decrease and dampening of activity with the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major offensive campaigns in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
The march through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the shots of the procession along the waterfront and my experience of the demonstrator, I estimate around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the quay and bridge and the opposite quay road.
That means there are really a lot of people.
Approximately four thousand demonstrators were joined by an unprecedented number of passersby in the procession.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
The persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to them finding a common language.
Only the anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, and others like them would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The activities of the Chcípl pes club are gaining in popularity, it reminds me of the Million Moments for Democracy in reverse.
Sometimes I get the feeling that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what kind of movement could be formed from this discontent, it depends not only on the influx of money but also on whether the Pfizer three-dose vaccine becomes a four or more dose vaccine.
Definitely it won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, bet on it.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is clear that we will need to be re-vaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
Brilliant action of scientists that humanity is rightfully proud of.
The end of the crisis, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister proclaiming change.
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has appointed Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
Tom has already succeeded in forming a broad coalition government that is expected to take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections due to the pressure of anti-corruption protests.
The victorious parties proclaiming a fight against corruption and abuse of power were unable to reach an agreement, so two more premature elections followed.

The secretly taken footage has become a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, concerns were growing about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing for several days and is being searched for by London police.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
According to information about the children's hospital worker, in addition to the police, her former employer and the Member of Parliament representing the part of London where she lived are also calling.
Lucy O'Connor from the Lambeth police department, where Petra worked, said in a Saturday video, "Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are starting to worry about her."
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is, she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 PM on Sunday, November 28th and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant to nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
We have immense concerns for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing, stated the group of healthcare facilities in a Twitter post.
We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help her to find to contact the police, the statement continued.

In Ústí nad Labem, there was a moon-shaped hole in the road in the form of an uncovered canal.
It was a matter of life and death.
The municipality referred complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which owns the road, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole remained.
Finally, the authorities clarified the responsibilities and ownership and after a month the Road and Motorway Directorate began to "intensively resolve the situation".
