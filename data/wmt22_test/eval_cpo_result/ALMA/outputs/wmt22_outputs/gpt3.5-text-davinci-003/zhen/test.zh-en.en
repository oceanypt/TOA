At the Zhejiang University Academic Conference, students sang the main theme and the research results opened up people's minds - Xinhua News Agency
At the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University yesterday evening, a series of creative academic achievements were commended, such as using air to wash hands, using breath to diagnose diseases, and accurately searching for the source of smog.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, covering various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical care, life science, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological Sensors: Your Home Health Checkup Doctor
Zhang Diming's team of doctoral students from the Biomedical Engineering College demonstrated an intelligent smartphone-based biosensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
You just need to take a deep breath and this set of instruments can detect your body's health condition from the components of the breath you exhale.
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, a health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart wristbands that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new type of material, as its target material for chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent surgical lights: High-powered eyes for doctors.
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights have also been used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up a new perspective on the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED shadowless lamp.
Many diseases are related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room due to early detection and inadequate removal.
Shen Junfei said that if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time during early cancer screening, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp panels, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical procedure, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate according to the needs of the surgery and personal preferences at any time.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and be cool.
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented a "air hand-washing device".
If we stand on the device's sink, our weight can compress the air out.
It's like a pep talk.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
"That way, we can get our hands clean!"
The colorimetric test and bacterial residue test have proven that the effect of handwashing through this method is the same as that of ordinary handwashing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the Second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world-leading universities and won the only gold award.
Please arrange for a replacement as soon as possible for me, thank you.
Please cancel the order and refund the cash, no points, and I will never use #PRS_ORG# again!
It is not suitable for children to eat bones and spicy pickles.
If so, please order as soon as possible.
No, not at the moment, thank you.
He asked me to tell you where he is.
I'm not waiting any longer, cancel the order.
I bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can it be changed?
Cancel the order.
Okay, no problem.
A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: First aid measures are emergency rescue measures taken in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
Now is the time for first aid.
If I really have a heart attack, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then we have only four minutes to save our lives, the golden four minutes!
It's so important for the people around us to know first aid!
When someone falls down beside us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly and not being able to do anything, which is a terrible feeling of helplessness.
In China, official data shows that there are three million accidental deaths every year, with the most dangerous being cardiac arrest.
On average, 15% of the United States can be saved.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 78% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%.
This is what the founding member Lu Le said first.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, has stopped breathing, and has no pulse, chest compressions are of no use.
It is only possible to save someone if artificial respiration and chest compressions are performed.
I have found that there are still few people who have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when faced with an emergency.
It might even save a person's life!
You can sign up for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai and there are student discounts available.
P.S.: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before I turn 25. Adding a first aid certificate to the list of goals was something I did a few months ago, but I did manage to accomplish it!
Next I'm going to take other certificates I want to take, I'm planning to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
Only one of the 13 yuan shrimp dumplings?!
I've never tried it.
Why doesn't #NAME# make it clear?
How much is it?
Yesterday, PRS delivered only one shrimp dumpling for me to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
To conclude, I personally believe that "Four Seas" is an all-around bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But if you were to say that this movie isn't a highlight, then at least the soundtrack selection is pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that can make you fall asleep in the cinema, one that can make you angry after watching it, and "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Emei Mountain for the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
On the point of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it feels like a creature from a cliche novel, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you might suspect that there are hidden metaphors implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it's actually just a pile of crap.
To start off, I'll briefly explain some of the plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, relying on his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man from the neighborhood to take her to the northeast in a small van to see the snow.
An elderly person taking a minibus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad are very reassured about this.
Then the old man disappeared without a trace.
How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the small hoodlums on the island easily block off a mountain road with their flying cars?
Then the truck delivering steel bars stopped by the side of the road, and the truck driver could not be found around.
The prop feel is too obvious, right?
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit record and criminal suspicions become a police auxiliary?
Why didn't they report the usury when facing it, and the police even asked if there was any difficulty in the movie?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room key to open a hotel door, and then has to resort to sleeping outside the room door because they can't find the hotel manager?
This inexplicable plot is pervasive throughout the movie, and it is so far-fetched that I feel pain when I recall it.
Besides the plot, what's worse is the movie's theme, or rather, the movie doesn't have a theme at all, it's just an ugly patchwork of a mess.
At the beginning of the movie, you would think it was a comedy, but 20 minutes later you might guess it was a motivational film. Halfway through, you thought it might be a story about how hard it is for small town youth to survive. After watching it, you had no idea what you had just seen, and you were left with a deep sense of doubt as to why you had gone to the cinema on a holiday to watch such a movie.
For most people, they are very familiar with the tropes of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, it would be a combination of inspirational and comedy, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a small-town biker boy and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
For example, the new motorbike that Yoon Jung-yeon's character rode and then sang after it got burned, we can't go too far with our wild imaginations like something that even Kennedy couldn't handle.
As for the female lead, who clearly isn't mentally challenged but acts like a 5-year-old in certain aspects, I really don't know if this is due to her acting or the director's request.
I also don't quite understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this movie arrangement in the Spring Festival file just to give the audience a headache?

Chongqing Vocational School is piloting the modern apprenticeship system, where admission is equivalent to being a quasi-employee of the enterprise - Xinhua News Agency.
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools. Students accepted for the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment they will be pre-recorded by the pilot enterprises as unit employees.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and enterprise probationary employees be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, a tripartite agreement shall be signed by apprentices, schools and enterprises. For apprentices who are 16 years old but not yet 18 years old, a four-party agreement shall be signed by the apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific posts, teaching content and rights and interests protection of apprentices on the job.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with enterprises to jointly carry out pre-job training and transfer training for enterprise employees.
Pilot schools need to reform their talent cultivation model.
The school and enterprise jointly design a talent cultivation program, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes a training system as a pilot period, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program. The top-level internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can proficiently master the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city has determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches, with each pilot program having around 50 people and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
According to the principle of first piloting and then implementing, exploring and establishing a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improving students' job skills, and improving the employment rate and quality of students.

South African doctors: Although Omecamivir has strong transmission power, it mostly causes mild symptoms.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus variant, Omikron, are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omikron variant spreads in South Africa, a medical organization of over 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms of the coronavirus patients they are currently treating are mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pierre said, "They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are more prone to severe cases of coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the last wave of the Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
In the two weeks following the first reported case of the Omnicron variant strain in Southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences.
Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, only 30% of recent COVID-19 hospitalizations have been severe cases, half of the proportion of the previous wave of the pandemic; the average length of hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of recent COVID-19 cases have resulted in death, compared to 20% in the early stages of the outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all indications point to this being a milder disease."
He also said, "It's still early, and we need to get the later data."
Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, but we have only been in this wave of the pandemic for two weeks.
At the same time, scientists around the world are monitoring case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite Deltha still being the main strain of the coronavirus worldwide, cases of Omikron are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December in Hauden Province increased by 400%, and tests showed that cases of the Omikron variant accounted for more than 90%.
Thank you to all the supporters today, 80 boxes were all given out!

Education Times Commentary: What Does It Take to Rescue Abducted Children?
If we apply the famous public welfare slogan "No buying, no killing" to this situation, then in a good environment without the demand for trafficking, collective prevention and public anti-trafficking will make trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes will not occur frequently.
Recently, the Child Abduction Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has gone online.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and to quickly recover abducted children.
I heard the name of this app is "Reunion", and it feels warm and cozy.
The new technological means not only have a poetic name, but also are properly applied in information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking enforcement is to locate and recover abducted children and protect their safety and freedom.
Next comes the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment can be enumerated with many "big words", ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
Before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
We should set aside topics with much debate and controversy, such as "Should child trafficking be punished with the death penalty?", and discuss them cautiously under the urgent purpose of "rescue". However, rescuing trafficked children cannot be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of this type of case, traffickers are accustomed to leaving the crime scene as soon as they succeed.
Every minute of delay in the anti-trafficking operation could mean a further step away from the child's parents and an increase in the difficulty of solving the case.
In this situation, taking practical action such as the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps to solve cases and find missing children, is indeed a wise move.
After all, "eradicating child abduction" is a big task that requires the whole legal system to be put into operation.
Combat crime, protect the rights of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all require the implementation of the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
Additionally, prevention of child trafficking can be improved from the family to the society.
For example, a common case, a family of three resting at a train station, the parents fall asleep and wake up to find their child missing.
You cannot expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, you should at least have a considerable awareness of protection.
Parents taking turns to rest or placing their children in a safe environment are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From another perspective of the police cracking down on human trafficking, those who purchase trafficked children should also be focused on and punished.
Single acts of wrongdoing are often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years; for those with particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed, and property shall be confiscated.
The starting point of punishment is high and the maximum penalty is heavy, so under the trend of "leniency", trafficking in children is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
There are still a significant number of human trafficking cases occurring every year to this day.
It is evident that some people have outdated ideas about parenting and a weak sense of legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot rely solely on official strict enforcement.
If the "market" of human trafficking is widespread, traffickers will be driven by their greed and constantly innovate their methods of trafficking, creating a "battle of wits" with law enforcement, making anti-trafficking efforts inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, eradicating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to combat the crime of child trafficking and buying.

At the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the "two establishements", how cultural enterprises should grasp the orientation, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Party. Yang Haodong answered them one by one in plain language and vivid examples. He earnestly exhorted young Party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle history of the Party, to unite closely around the Central Committee of the Party, to stay with the Party unswervingly, and to use their youth to contribute to their responsibilities and responsibilities.

Actually, I don't know if it was the store's mistake or the delivery rider's mistake.
There is no receipt on the bag.
Cannot investigate further.
I hope you understand.
The delivery time was 30 minutes faster than what was shown.
No more, thank you.
Yes, a new rider has been assigned.
He has been waiting for a long time.
The restaurant has always been said to be in the process of handling.
I waited for a few hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil (or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
First-pressed olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanically cold-pressing and filtering fresh olives to remove impurities.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The flavor is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant aroma, and an acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Acceptable taste and flavor, with acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained by refining the first-pressed olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or known as "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades.
Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of extra virgin olive oil to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, transparent light golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil obtained by extraction and refining from the pomace by the solvent method.
You should have noticed that acidity is a very important indicator for olive oil after seeing the grading classification.
Just like grapes used to make wine come from different regions and varieties, olives from different regions and varieties will produce olive oil of different standards.
The best place for olive tree growth:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity, and precipitation for the growth of olives.
Outside of the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only grow crops sporadically in suitable climates.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and more, as well as countries further south such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa with similar climates.
The harvesting months for olives are __________.
From March to June every year, olive trees bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the season for harvesting fruits (freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional Components of Olive Oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded with Biden declaring that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy" convened by US President Biden and attended by government, civil society, and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world concluded on Friday (December 10th).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of people all over the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also expressed that plans are in place to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representative and political affairs committee member Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the task before us is."
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere in the world.
Autocratic regimes can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world.
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires a collective effort from the entire society.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be better able to buffer and withstand the forces of authoritarianism, as well as those who would brazenly pursue power before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the Democratic Summit are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
Today is International Human Rights Day.
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also stated in his opening remarks on the same day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, particularly those posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, and the resilience of democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
We must also firmly condemn all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong delivered a speech at the summit via pre-recorded video, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans in Hong Kong.
He said, "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our top priority.
Luo Guancong also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some of you don't realize the threat the Chinese Communist Party poses to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason why we must change.
Taiwan's Executive Yuan Policy Affairs Committee Member Tang Feng attended a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Autocracy and Affirming Democratic Values" and released the "National Statement" via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands on the front line against autocracy and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain firmly on the front lines of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have justified the infringement of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, indicating a global retreat of democracy.
In Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take down fake news to win the battle.
On the second day of the "Democratic Summit", the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea that were identified as serious human rights violators, and also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have already taken the photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
The restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying the delivery time.
Originally it was going to be #NUMBER#.
Anyways, I'm not calling.
I'm not eating anymore.
I will definitely file a complaint.
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you couldn't deliver?
I've been waiting for you for so long.
No, I did not receive the call.
Please notify him to deliver to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
One meal waited for one and a half hours.
#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered yet.
I would like to cancel my order.
Why not cancel?
Hello, the salivating chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones. These "entry-level" paddles are actually industrial waste.
They have low power, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very strong, the hard ball cannot be held, and it is difficult for experts to control.
The underlying logic and subtext of their existence is-- tennis is so hard, they know you won't be able to learn it, they know you won't be willing to buy expensive ones, so they give you a cheap one to fool you, you play it twice and you won't play it again, so the racket is cheap and you don't feel bad about it.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have improved. Come back to me to buy the expensive ones then, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a slightly better used racket, either Prince or Dunlop, as these two brands are not well-known enough so good rackets are not sold at a high price. A new one for 500 or 600 is good enough, and a used one for 200. Wouldn't it be great to enjoy the experience of a thousand-dollar racket?
It is friendly to newcomers, but it becomes useless after the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed multiple times.
Can you help me follow up on this?
Postpone
Thank you.
So, I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order now? Do I ignore the previous one?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant but many items were missing and the saliva chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# said I should take it for no reason, please cancel it.
My order was for delivery, there was no option for pick-up.

Actually, there are a lot of considerations for girls who are slightly overweight when it comes to dressing.
The skirt of a girl with a fat body should not be too short or too long, the length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the fat part of the thighs.
Wearing a skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on your legs.
Having too much length will give a person a short and chubby impression.
If you divide your outfit into three sections - top, skirt, and long socks - and use different colors for each, it will give you a more elongated look and make you appear taller naturally.
Actually, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. A noble and elegant black skirt is also the first choice for slightly chubby girls.
Wear dark colors of clothing, especially a black mini skirt, and it will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are chubby, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popular it is, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet and giving the impression of being overweight.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to know the tricks of dressing well.
Chubby girls should never wear tight mini skirts, and the tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which would make people uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black long socks or mesh socks (the kind with thin grids). Choose a soft printed trumpet skirt and pair it with a drape neck top to cover up the shortcomings of chubby girls.
Of course, there is also a certain finesse when it comes to dressing a slightly plump girl in a short skirt.
A fat girl should choose a top that matches the color of her short skirt, which will make her plump figure look taller.
Pairing a mini skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender, and it's the most IN look for summer!
If you are a MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a glamorous dress.
Not only can it cover up your big belly, it can also show off your best features.
A-line skirts will make you look slim, which is suitable for chubby girls. Choose tighter tops to create a layered look and make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt, even plus-sized women can try it.
The slightly chubby girl can also dress fashionably.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing, even slightly overweight girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in clothing combinations, let's exercise more in life and strive to get rid of the label of "slightly chubby girl" one day earlier 😄

"It's still better than thinking of it as a flesh wound," said the girl as she acted as a target for her sister's fundraising - Xinhua News
At Hangzhou Wulin Square, a girl stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a 'target' to raise money for her sister" went viral on social media.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a slightly taller wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The board reads "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow", indicating that passersby can use a bow and arrow after paying.
The behavior has sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl did such an extreme move for her sister's fundraising, but such behavior is not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The girl street "archery target" fundraising was warned.
In the circulated picture, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board. The board is written with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" in black ink. Another board in front of her is written with her bank account, WeChat, Alipay account, etc.
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens think this is a "begging for attention" behavior, and many netizens sympathize with it.
We discovered the situation when we were patrolling around the square at around 10am on the 23rd, and there were already quite a few onlookers at that time.
The police officers from the Tianshui Police Station near the incident site said in an interview with local media that there were two girls selling goods, both around 20 years old, dressed in youthful and beautiful attire.
The girl who was the "human target" was continuously crying and asking passersby to play the game; the other girl was standing by and shouting, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for surgery, asking everyone to help.
We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng Branch of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Ji Jiali and she is raising donations for her elder sister Ji Jiayan.
But due to the need for more than 300,000 in treatment costs, they could not think of a good way to raise funds, so they resorted to this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, two girls were involved, one as the target and the other as the assistant, but neither of them actually shot the arrows. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but some people were watching and took pictures which were posted on Weibo.
After the police investigation, the bow and arrow used was determined to not be regulated by the security department.
The responsible person stated, "We do not advocate this kind of fundraising for publicity."
After being warned by the police officers at the police station, she has left the police station.
Heat dissipation: Good; Thinness: Convenient; Appearance material: Satisfied; Acer has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
Performance is stable and the four exhaust outlets provide good cooling, making it worth recommending.
This Acer Shadow Knight gaming laptop is great, with good craftsmanship and materials, and a reliable brand!
The Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is still not too expensive in terms of price.
I personally think the Acer Predator Dragon is really good. The game performance is smooth and I can play most games with a high frame rate. It's very smooth, and LOL is no exception. CSGO is also easily handled, and most AAA games can be played.
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is good, the fan is powerful, the work is quite quiet, and the game effect is still not small when the fan is fully open.
Appearance material: The appearance is cool and stylish, the game laptop is very cool. Display effect: The screen is clear, playing games at 1080 is enough.
Buying a laptop felt really good, mainly for design purposes, with a great cost-performance ratio, lighter than expected, and better looking than expected. The red on the back is a very nice wine color, not too flashy, and overall much better than expected. It's worth the purchase, and it's suitable for girls too.
I started using the Acer Nitro Knight two years ago and it has been a great value for money with excellent quality!
I also recommend this product to all my friends around me!
We have already purchased three machines in this series!
The appearance is attractive and the configuration is also good.
I bought something for my nephew, and I was planning to wait for the 418 bank event, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance and missed the big bank event, which is a bit regretful.
The cost-performance ratio is quite high, and the logistics is quite fast, so let's come back and review it after a while.
This is a brand new, high-value-for-money gaming laptop with a great design, pre-installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought a computer for a child to do 3D rendering, the software has been installed, the child said it can be used without any problems, this computer can do 3D design work with good performance.
He said it was great that I bought it for my son.
The computer is great, especially the customer service attitude is very good, don't understand just ask, recommend buying.
Not bad, the graphics of the game are really nice.
What is the hottest trend in 2021?
Without a doubt, it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there was a very popular article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete for the Gold Medal in the Olympics". It mentioned that project managers can be the first in many projects and no one can match them: carrying bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, and putting out fires, taking responsibility, and apologizing are even more common.
This seemingly humorous article also reveals the daily hardships of project managers, representing the current lack of enthusiasm for project management work.
People engaged in project management are gradually choosing to take action to get themselves out of work-related predicaments.
From the increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional certification) registrations each year, more and more project management practitioners are enhancing their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management 20 Years Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificates worldwide.
The number of PMP certified people has been increasing year by year in the past 10 years, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer feasible to simply copy the "old experience" and that the ever-changing working environment requires us to learn and explore the way forward on the shoulders of scientific giants.
Does passing the PMP guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners say that by learning courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten major fields and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: inadequate project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control and sensitivity, project dragging on; unclear member division, "old hands" in the team not knowing how to respond, cross-departmental assistance communication not smooth, project difficult to advance...
Therefore, having focused on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and has been awarded the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". They have brought the online course "R&D Project Manager Training Camp" here.
The "Research and Development Project Manager Training Camp" online course is a way of online fragmented learning, combining many practical cases, tools and methods of R&D-type enterprises, to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced path of project management.
This is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, resulting in efficient operational results for the enterprise.
Talk is cheap, so let's take a look at what other students have to say about this course: This course is not only taught by the Zhongtianhua Xia expert team (formerly Huawei R&D management team), but also combines international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprise real business scenarios to give a professional and in-depth explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.

Jiexin advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" shopping festival saw the total amount of online payment transactions nationwide reach 177 billion yuan, setting a new record compared to previous years.
The various discounts and coupons, as well as the eye-catching live streaming of goods, have once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumer boom has made people marvel at the increasing strength of national consumption, but on the other hand, we must also calmly reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer group.
Ahead of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there are still large disparities in terms of financial behavior and skills, and there is a need to further improve basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and the youth is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous attention in financial education. According to the "China Young People's Debt Status Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance, the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is contrary to the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, which have caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiexin has always been committed to helping people build their happy lives with quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the call of supervision, to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
Over the past few years, CreditEase has been carrying out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young groups including college students, and through cooperation with top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms to subtly guide the consumption needs of young groups, helping them to establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate wealth for life.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Jiexin reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid the misunderstanding of consumption and borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is important to plan ahead and pay back on time according to one's means.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as car purchase and house purchase in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to bring consumers more tailored services and diversified services with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and iterated financial products, continuously helping the public to improve their financial knowledge, helping consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and becoming a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

Vietnamese People's Newspaper Network - Gulf Cooperation Council Responding to Common Challenges
The stops on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tour include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis, which was triggered by the embargo imposed by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies on Qatar in mid-2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, imposed a full embargo on it, accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, and having close ties with Iran.
The severe diplomatic tension has affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have imposed a blockade on land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January, with the Gulf countries signing an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore their relationship with Qatar by leading the effort to appoint a new ambassador from each country in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states resolving their differences to restore relations with Qatar is driven by the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
A 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' businesses have signed 13 Memorandums of Understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and the major world powers over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement which the Gulf Arab states had condemned for failing to address the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a "competitor" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is deficient to not address the Iranian missile issue and take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
In the context of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran not meeting the desires of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the slowing of economic growth for the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of the GCC unity, and to propose measures to enable its member states to cooperate fully in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Good.
It is said that the exhaust sound of supercars in the New Mountain District is the loudest!
This car that our team has brought to you all is the dream of many men!
It's the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago — the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit, and the annual road tax is around thirteen thousand Malaysian Ringgit. It has four-wheel drive, so why is it called the LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is with 700 horsepower?
I don't know either, the data says it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, so while it takes my Myvi to reach 30km/h, others have already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low-slung body, aggressive scissor doors, huge intakes around the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
You don't need to say too much about the car model; just Google it and you'll find what you need. Here are some explanations that you may not find on Google!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is watching, it's really uncomfortable (but kind of cool)!
km of fuel costs around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all).
Practice the posture for getting on and off the train, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you won't be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will be temporarily deaf after getting off (but it's still awesome).
The car is too big, so it would be too narrow to park in a regular parking spot, and I'm afraid it will get hit when the car next to it opens its door!
It's a bit lonely because there's no one to compete with on the road.
Everyone, don't get the wrong idea - the supercar in the video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for their beloved car, welcome to contact us!
More car information that you don't know about can be found in The Car Guide / People's Car Guide.
Involved in a car accident worth millions!
Car enthusiasts are familiar with both the Bugatti Chiron and the Porsche 911. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
On that day, millions of dollars worth of cars, including the Porsche 911 and the Bugatti Chiron, were destroyed in just a few minutes abroad!
You are right to look at the results!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News
The so-called spirit of the university refers to a series of educational concepts and values that have been accumulated over the long-term development of a university, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been of utmost importance for the development of politics, economics, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in our country, which arose in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "promoting virtue and benefiting the world, rectifying and governing the country" and the patriotism of "promoting learning and strengthening the country".
Currently, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, global educational competition, technological competition, and talent competition are intensifying, and higher education as an important "supply side" is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in structural reform.
The proposal of the Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines especially demonstrates our country's confidence and determination to move from a higher education power to a higher education strong country, and also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How can we make a breakthrough and quickly build a number of world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines in a relatively short period of time, while still having a certain gap, to achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to having a firm goal, path, and ability confidence, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the late-mover advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning and drawing from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a remarkable improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, the system advantage, making use of the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint forces, optimizing resource allocation, to provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the university to accelerate its catch-up to the world's advanced level.
We must be especially aware that it is impossible for all universities to be the same when building world-class universities. Each school must show its own personality and characteristics while playing to its strengths.
The school's characteristics should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect each school's unique target positioning, educational tradition, and resource endowment.
At Zhejiang University, we emphasize three characteristics in our education: first, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated environment of science, technology and education, and industry-university cooperation, and form a complete chain of entrepreneurial education ecology; second, we emphasize the convergence of interdisciplinary characteristics, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we emphasize the characteristics of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang production-learning-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always uphold the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the shared values of "Diligence, Virtue, Clarity, and Diligence", and the shared expression system of "Harboring Rivers and Seas, Opening Up True and Noble Virtues, Opening Up the World and Building Our Country" constitute the latest expression system of the Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education, continuously accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
"Hai Na Jiang He" emphasizes an open and inclusive spirit, embodying the mentality of "using talents from all over the world", and expressing the idea of learning from the world's top universities; "Qi Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also cultivating virtue and character; "Kai Wu Qian Min" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, including the pursuit of knowledge and research innovation, as well as reform and development and innovation; "Shu Wo Bang Guo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always share the same honor and disgrace with the nation's destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and values is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
The wise listen to the soundless, the enlightened see the formless.
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the Chinese socialist cause, deeply understand the era and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, upholding humanistic care and independent freedom, let the spirit of the university stimulate the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation, thus providing an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

Iranian President: If sanctions against Iran are lifted, there is hope for a nuclear deal to be reached - Xinhua News

Guangxi University students can take a leave of absence for up to five years for entrepreneurship - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency reported from Nanning on May 19th that according to the Education Department of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible academic system, relax the school suspension limit for college students, and extend the suspension and entrepreneurship period for students from two to five years on the basis of the original academic system. The suspension and entrepreneurship time can be counted as practical education time.
To promote the enhancement of college students' entrepreneurial and innovative capabilities, the departments of Education and Human Resources and Social Security of Guangxi have jointly set up an entrepreneurial platform, built more off-campus practice teaching bases, university science and technology parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurial incubation bases, providing external guarantees for college students' entrepreneurship.
By 2020, each college is required to have an innovation and entrepreneurship practice base with an area of at least 3,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and at least 2,000 square meters for higher vocational schools.
The government encourages universities to set up innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and gives priority to students who perform exceptionally well in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to switch majors.
High school teachers must go to industry enterprises for at least two months of internship every two years in order to enhance their awareness and ability of innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Autonomous Region Education Department requires all universities in Guangxi to deeply implement the University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program, striving to ensure that every university student participates in an innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their school period.
High schools should actively organize students to participate in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at all levels and provide financial support.

At the same time as the NFT craze was quickly fading, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to gain a stable income from playing this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, with a variety of gameplay including NFTs. It is currently the highest-trading NFT project, with a total transaction volume of over 3 billion US dollars.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue has exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, rivaling "King of Glory".
On August 6th of this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
Axie Infinity is bringing a new "play-to-earn" model to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts. Players are no longer just single roles, and can not only get enjoyment and economic benefits from the game, but also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This agency is not granted by the game developer, but is secured by blockchain technology.
My biggest takeaway from seeing the news about my friend's stock price is the choice of industry for investment targets, which includes selecting an industry with a large growth space, at least a market size of 100 billion; secondly, selecting an industry with good future growth potential, considering the industry that will reach its peak growth in the next 3-5 years; and lastly, selecting an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
The first thing for the new year is to review 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
Strategy is about "doing the things right", or doing things correctly.
Strategy lies in "doing the right thing", that is, doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about implementation, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, in addition to thinking about how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can consider whether to continue deepening in the current field or to expand horizontally into other fields (strategic thinking); in addition to thinking about how to increase customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can consider how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in addition to thinking about how to increase activity participation (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the right KPIs for activities, achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; in addition to thinking about how to increase DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin has seen several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin a legal tender, marking the first time Bitcoin has been made a legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12th, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares' launch of the first Bitcoin ETF in eight years, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This marks the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the US capital market, further expanding the investment exposure of cryptocurrencies.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14th, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot" which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian American groups have filed complaints against three Ivy League universities, including Yale, for alleged discrimination in admissions - Xinhua News.
On May 23, over 130 Asian American groups submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice, protesting the discrimination of Asian American applicants in the admissions process of the three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which is leading the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, the chairman of the group, Zhao Yu Kong, said that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American universities has doubled in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in these three American universities has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been "systematically and persistently discriminating against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "holistic admissions" process.
Zhao Yu-Kong stated that in 2014, research conducted by scholars such as Sanders showed that among the three universities, Asian applicants had the lowest acceptance rate relative to the number of applicants among all ethnicities.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yu-Kong told Xinhua reporters that they hope that after submitting the appeal, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to address this issue and change their admissions policies towards Asian Americans.
Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it had complained about Harvard University's discriminatory admissions practices, but the US Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups participating in this appeal, American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups are also included.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhoutian Town, Yuyao from a real estate agent. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the factory purchase with the family of the house owner, Lin, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Lin Mou signed as the payee on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which states that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice; both parties agree to sign the factory purchase contract within one week."
However, afterwards the two sides were unable to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment methods, resulting in the house sale contract being delayed in signing.
Considering that the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
Mr. Lu was frustrated and angry when he finally found a house he liked, paid the deposit, and had the money ready to sign the contract, only to find out that the seller was no longer willing to sell.
Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyue City People's Court.
The court found that since the parties were unable to sign a formal contract, it cannot be solely attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations failed, so the double return of the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the breach of contract liability.
After the first trial judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the second trial court upheld the original verdict.
Lawyer's Reminder: Exercise necessary diligence and care in the course of the transaction.
As the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence when signing the contract, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied by others, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
After the "Leaders' Summit on Democracy" ended on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11th) that the US-hosted "Leaders' Summit on Democracy" was "drawing ideological lines, turning democracy into a tool and a weapon, pretending to be democratic while actually doing the opposite, stirring up division and confrontation, and shifting domestic conflicts".
The Chinese government believes that for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, carried out "democratic transformation", imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolutions", and caused disastrous consequences.
Democracy has already become a "massive weapon of destruction" for the US to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day conference was held via video, with 111 global leaders invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic issues, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of criticism both internationally and domestically in the US, such as criticizing the invited leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, Brazil, etc. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden administration in organizing this summit is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, also participated in the video democratic summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy is showing its pathology, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, party polarization, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and wealth disparities becoming increasingly severe. American democracy is a 'rich man's game' built on a capitalist foundation."
In his speech, US President Biden stated, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be better equipped to buffer and withstand the forces of authoritarianism and those who seek power nakedly before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not a given, "We must constantly renew it in each generation, and in my view, this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend it at a time when it faces persistent and worrying challenges".
The US has promised to launch a year-long initiative following the Democratic Summit, which includes a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media outlets.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical Democracy Summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries fulfill our commitments and report on the progress we have made by next year."
OK, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.
The Richeng Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch).
Minty Environment: Standard Service: Quick service. My must-order dish is "Traditional Mala Cake". The Mala Cake is so fragrant, soft and delicious 😋 If you like desserts, you must try the "Dongjiang Cuttlefish Tofu Pot". The soup is very fresh and the tofu is very tender. The cuttlefish...
The taste is great, the meat is good, and the service is friendly.
It's been a while since I've been to Ritchang, and the fruit lao is still as delicious as ever with plenty of ingredients. I tried the cha siu bao for the first time and it was just like the soft and fluffy southern-style dough I love!
The braised rice was cooked to perfection, with generous portions. The signature wax paper chicken wings were as good as ever, and the soup was also good. The kale was also handled quite well...
The taste is great, the service is friendly, and the meat is good.
The old shop of Richeng has been a popular online presence for many years, located in a small building in Dongdan with wooden floors.
The queue at the entrance is always long before you can get a pot of rice, and the pot is cracked...
It has been several years since I last went to eat at Richeng. The rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to find a restaurant with available seating, and the food quality is as good as ever.
The taste is great, the meat is good, and the staple food is great.
Order takeout from Ri Chang.
Meal of [Rice]: The dish this time was a bit of a disappointment.
Three cups of chicken: there is a bit too much side dish, and a bit too little chicken.
The main flavor of this dish is a bit off, the underlying salty taste is not enough, which highlights the sweetness. Everyone can imagine sweet + various spices and side dishes...
What is the Red Card Whiskey drinking method?
Everyone has different hobbies; some people like collecting, some people like food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red Label Whisky is one of the most popular Scotch whiskies in the world right now, and it has won the gold medal at the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, it would be a waste of its smoothness.
How do you drink Red Label whisky?
The editor will give a brief introduction for everyone.
Red Label Whiskey Drinking Method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and the traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.
The entrance is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be enjoyed on its own with ice, or mixed with your favorite beverage.
Red Label Whiskey has entered the Chinese market, and in order to cater to the tastes of the Chinese people, Red Label Whiskey mixed with Coca-Cola, Sprite, or Fanta has become a timeless and fashionable drink.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being able to neutralize the sourness, can bring visual pleasure to people. Adding them to drinks can dilute the taste of alcohol and change the taste.
The most authentic and traditional way to drink Red Label Whiskey is with a slice of lemon and a cube of sugar (or granulated sugar).
The authentic Hongfang Wei has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky. Everyone can try them as a reference. Hopefully this introduction can help everyone.
Education Thinking: How College Exams Can Benefit Both "Academic Achievers" and "Academic Strugglers" - Xinhua News
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the type of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In a university campus, students come from all over the world with different abilities and levels of learning, resulting in a wide variety of learning situations.
Assessing such a diverse group of people will inevitably lead to different perceptions.
Of course, if the exam questions are single-type and have a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't put in effort may be able to pass an exam by cramming right before it, but if they try other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, "underachievers" can pass the exams without much effort and even get high scores; "overachievers" who never miss classes, have good homework and notes, and don't score much higher than the others, have created a "strange situation".
It appears that the Lanzhou Jiaotong University students' reflection of the problems in university exams is not without reason, and it is believed that this situation is not only present at Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
We should give praise to the three students who wrote the letters directly.
People who have been to university know that it is not uncommon for students to cram for exams, try to get exam questions from teachers, negotiate the scope of the exam, and even cheat during the exam or ask the teacher for help after the exam.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment of teaching, measuring the qualification of a university exam is more about the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by the teacher, and the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to specialize, and many major courses focus on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether one has a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what university exams are testing.
Undergraduate knowledge is mostly basic disciplinary theories and common sense. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large and is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics for university 20 years ago is still being studied and is still a priority."
Even though the knowledge points remain the same, it does not mean that the exam questions are all the same and repetitive.
At many universities, exams are generally composed of a question-setting team, with senior subject teachers coordinating the composition of the test paper. The marking of the exam is also carried out by all the teachers responsible for the subject, so as to overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
To formulate a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and the teaching situation should be comprehensively mastered to analyze the students' learning level, so as to dynamically grasp the difficulty and type of the exam, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time, innovate the design of the type of questions.
Exams are the baton of university education, and whatever type of exams there are, students will have corresponding preparation plans, and over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The Lanzhou Jiaotong University highly values the advice letter from the students and has deployed a rectification plan across the whole school.
Require all teaching units to organize teachers to carry out research and course final exams for self-inspection, formulate examination paper topics and related systems, and strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper topics and review links, refine score evaluation, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Solving the problem of single question type and repeated questions from a mechanism perspective is an issue that university examination affairs need to face, of course, corresponding systems need to be established, but the effort lies in daily work, teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation, to understand both sides, teachers and students will be better connected, forming a benign interaction, the exam will also be more in line with reality, thus allowing "scholars" and "dunces" to get what they deserve.
Can I get delivery instead if you can't change my store location?
No need for me to give more money then, right?
The colleague's order has been delivered.
I can't pull it off.
Where is the GPS? Has it arrived yet?
Mrs. Kim's Wedding Photography (Nanjie Store) does not have any branches yet.
Before taking the photos, we had to change the time twice because we didn't arrange the time properly, and our consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, we chose to take the photos on a nice weekend.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether it be consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all amazing.
That was my first time ever doing formal makeup, wow~ I can't believe I could look so good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and another girl (sorry I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and it looked very natural.
The exterior shots were taken at Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was good that day so we didn't feel too cold. While taking photos, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes and headgear, and if anything was slightly off they would immediately help us fix it.
The photographer was also very humorous, and felt very happy after taking pictures all day.
When selecting photos, we were not at all inclined to add any more photos than the 24 included in the package, even though we had seen many examples online and didn't want to make our customers delete too many. My cousin, who had her wedding photos taken around the same time as me, had a package of over 7,000 yuan and added over 10,000 photos, which shocked me and made me afraid of selecting too many.
The photos were fixed today, Lan Lan sent them to me, I looked at them and there were two that I didn't think were very good, so they immediately helped me fix them again.
Digging out the photos my sister took before and comparing them, I'm really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and refreshing, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Mrs. Jin's studio for wedding photos!
Package Price: 3999 Yuan
Mrs. Kim is thankful to have you and sincerely wishes you happiness and a bright future!

Over 3,200 newborns in Sabah have no birth certificates due to a shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper.
The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper ran out in early October, birth certificates could not be issued to newborns, and the cumulative number of those affected has now reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Caluramunus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have had their information recorded in the system, and the anti-counterfeit paper will be reissued once it arrives next week.
He explained at the press conference in response to a report from a web media that the Sabah newspaper had been printing on recycled paper for 10 months.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago, and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in our country.
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah Times is different from other regions, so it cannot borrow inventory from other states.
Kaluram Amunus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and then return to Sabah for the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it will take two more working days (December 20th) to deliver it to the applicant.
We will notify applicants to go to the local branch to pick up the birth certificate.
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
I have been waiting since around 7 o'clock.
Is that almost here?
I'm referring to food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG# again.
Okay, thank you, the restaurant said they are ready.

Education News: Beijing Compresses Ratio of Specialty Students Admitted to Junior High in 2016 - Xinhua News
On the 21st and 22nd, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission unified the organization to implement the examination of middle school admission for special talent students.
This year, all districts in Beijing have compressed the proportion of special talent student admissions, making the competition for special talent students even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the overall proportion of primary school students entering junior high school as special talents this year should not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan in the district, with a planned enrollment of 380 people, and the proportion of students admitted should not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
Students who have special talents in sports, art, and technology and who have registered online are eligible to participate in the special enrollment examination.
In order to facilitate students to take the exam nearby, Dongcheng District continues the exam arrangement from last year, setting 1-2 exam sites in each school district, for a total of 13 exam sites.
Exam points are divided into exam rooms according to the exam area, and time periods are divided by hour. Students will be tested in different exam rooms in the exam area according to the time period on the same day.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document requiring strengthened epidemic prevention and control at port cities within 48 hours of a negative nucleic acid test and setting up a "buffer zone". - Xinhua News
The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring people who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) to hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours, and people who go to land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port city range in each province, region and city to March 15, 2022.
Additionally, the notice also proposed that conditional port cities may study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
The responsible person from the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the two sides of the border have frequent exchanges.
Implement differentiated management policies in different regions, transforming from one line of defense against the spread of the epidemic to two lines of defense, which is expected to move the control point forward and compress the risk of the epidemic spreading, achieving the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been multiple local cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as inadequate local epidemic monitoring and early warning, inadequate closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, routine nucleic acid testing being merely formal, inadequate disinfection of cold-chain items at each link, inadequate management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires efforts to be made in nine aspects, such as perfecting the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, establishing a sound epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the weak links and shortcomings in the prevention and control of port cities, and to do the prevention and control work without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihood, publish and facilitate the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly check for potential risks in the supply and prices of basic living materials, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding issues reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include counties (cities, districts, banners) where open land, water, and air ports are located, cities (districts, states, leagues) where they are located, and directly-administered cities, with the specific scope to be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous region, directly-administered city) according to epidemic prevention and control needs.

YouTube video reveals the truth of the US military's 20-year bloodthirsty massacre - Xinhua News
Source of video: YouTube
On December 11th, a micro-documentary on YouTube titled "Killing Machines" gained widespread attention.
This film tells the story of the US launching the Afghanistan War in the name of "anti-terrorism" and forcibly exporting American-style democracy. After 20 years of war, they have committed various crimes against humanity, such as killing innocent people and engaging in bloody violence.
Misusing drones to launch airstrikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools distorts human nature and establishes killing squads.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to inflict various forms of torture and personal humiliation on "suspects".
Human atrocities have sparked even more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American "war on terror" has become "more terrorizing than terrorized".
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, only a ravaged country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video and let's uncover the truth of the US's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article which explains why the customer wants to have a logistics company in the bonded zone to do canning, even though canning is a deep processing and not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business.
I went to many infant formula factories and got to know many infant formula production lines.
Actually, the raw materials of bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference.
So everyone is sure to ask: why is the shelf life of a bag one year, while the shelf life of a can is two years or longer?
Or you may ask, why is there such a big price difference between the tinned and bagged versions?
Actually, many consumers, or moms, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, it's just that people think that expensive is good.
Some consumers have eaten with this mentality and then reacted saying that the taste or flavor of the packaged food is different!
Now I will explain to everyone the reasons why listening is expensive. Where is the expense?
Why is there such a big price difference if their raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the bagged pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or even no profits, then how can the manufacturers survive?
Therefore, they had a large increase in their list prices to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers promote cans rather than bags.
How do these companies afford to spend millions or even billions of dollars on advertising every year?
It goes without saying.
As society develops, the costs of market promotion, such as mall promotional personnel, mall display costs, product gift costs, advertising costs, etc., are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are continuously introducing new products, especially earphones, and their prices are also increasing. This is actually due to the increase in market costs for new products.
The main purpose is to get higher profits, although the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
Some brands, in order to promote their products, resort to any means necessary and collaborate with doctors in hospitals to assist in product promotion, earning profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per sale.
Chinese laws absolutely do not allow such operations and methods, and in fact, this practice is taking advantage of consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk powder and store it in a can at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of the milk powder without any effect on the children.
Don't assume that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food. If the shelf life of canned food and bagged food is the same after opening, it just means that bagged food is not easy to store and is prone to moisture and deterioration.
The delivery was late and the food was cold, so it was dry and hard and completely inedible.
And the soup spilled out.
Cancel immediately, the things #PRS_ORG# sent must be cold by now.
I've never taken it!
#NAME# said nobody went to get it.

Don't startle people at the starting line - Xinhua News
When browsing the book market, one often feels the popularity of success-related books.
Nowadays, many successful self-help books promote the "best principle" - that is, assume or imply that you can "do it" first, and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, it skipped over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
Therefore, these books all have one thing in common - either give it your all and do your best, or don't do anything at all; either it's 100%, or it's 0%; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay put.
This "best principle" is universally acknowledged as "right beyond doubt", but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "you must make a firm resolution, start anew, and make a 180-degree change" path, which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
It is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the lute to a cow to shout "you need to change" in the ear of someone who is conservative, adheres to rules, and resists change.
Most people are hesitant and reluctant to take the first step when faced with the word "transformation", or they make a sudden impulse to make a determination to transform and take the first step bravely, but often it doesn't last long and they give up quickly, making it difficult to maintain.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the most vivid representation of this classic "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making the vast majority of people "sigh in despair".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that could lead more ordinary people to relative success.
The core of the "Next Best Principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve a big victory", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always better than staying in the same place.
In short, it's always better to do something than nothing.
By drastically lowering the threshold, it has become possible for ordinary people to persist, and with persistence, the chances of success will increase.
Just following the path of success with the "second-best principle" takes a bit longer.
In short, although the "best principle" appears to be a banner for everyone to succeed, it ultimately only motivates a few; whereas the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.

The amount of naked carp resources stored in Qinghai Lake has increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency reported from Xining on December 11th (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) that according to the latest monitoring results from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tons, which is more than 40 times the amount at the beginning of the protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Kunyu", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as massive hunting and the degradation of the naked carp breeding water environment, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the stock of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish farming, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main tributaries of Qinghai Lake, designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures, the resource reserve of Qinghai Lake naked carp is increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp have been artificially propagated and released into Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Sanjiangyuan area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued key water area fishing bans for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, establishing a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, to put it in, and it's cold outside.
Is the takeout packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I want to know if it was left out or if someone took it, thanks.
It has been an hour already and it still hasn't been delivered.
I just saw an article about taking a vacation that was too long.
Give a science lesson to the uninformed male.
Most girls experience their first period between the ages of 13-15, and menopause around the age of 50.
After the premise of good health, it will come once a month regularly.
It is not regular enough to predict accurately, with a tolerance of about one week, so preparation is needed in advance. Sometimes, if luck is bad, it can be suddenly advanced for several days.
The length of time, amount of blood, and degree of menstrual cramps vary from person to person; some people have it for three days, some for a week; some have light bleeding, some have heavy bleeding; some have no reaction, some are in so much pain they need to be taken away in an ambulance; menstrual cramps can change over time, just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful in the future.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and it lasts for several days with 24 hours of bleeding. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from getting on clothes and furniture.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen when the menstrual cycle just starts can effectively relieve the pain of that month. Taking ibuprofen after the cramps start will not be effective.
Before menstruation, due to excessive uterine blood flow and prostaglandin release, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it's around the time of your period, and you suddenly have stomach cramps, your period will usually come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily grow. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change it six times a day, seven days a month, which is 42 pieces. If you add the extra ones prepared in advance, it may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
You don't need to change the sanitary pad often; about every five or six hours is enough, and the longest time should be eight hours.
Hormonal changes during the menstrual period may make one more irritable, and the ovulation period can also cause emotional instability due to hormonal changes, making it a very unlucky time as the body trips itself up.
Official crime rate data shows that women have a high ability to control their emotions and will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
Not only blood flows, but also the shed endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house, building a house (endometrium thickening) every month to prepare for guests, but if the guests do not come, it will all be dismantled (menstruation is discharged) and a new house will be built next month, repeating the cycle.
Having a period is very inconvenient; it has been happening for decades, with a few days of bleeding for 24 hours each month, plus abdominal and back pain - who would want that?
But people can be born because their mother had menstruation, which is to prepare a house for you to stay for 10 months when you first come to this world, everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things for women were suppressed, and society brainwashed them into thinking that it was dirty, shameful, and that's just how it was. But times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting and thinks that the preparation of a female body for bearing life is disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this lifetime and don't understand it very well should not be so ungrateful and disrespectful. How can they face their own mothers with this attitude and how can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary cotton swabs, they're really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, giving the wrong gifts is quite disappointing.
Order an additional meal for the children.
I hope the store will take the time to check the products even when they are busy.
Is the foot bath tub leaking electricity and causing the pins and needles sensation?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good therapeutic and health care effect. Today, Gome's editors will answer this question and hope it will be helpful to our friends.
As people become more health-conscious, foot baths are becoming increasingly popular with consumers, and a wide variety of products have emerged in the market, ranging from one hundred to thousands of yuan. This gives consumers a lot of choice.
According to the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health care home appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no specific industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!
Mr. Li told reporters that recently he bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he was soaking his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt tingling in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and it lit up unexpectedly. To his surprise, Mr. Li found that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was still good, even though the foot bath was returned. Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
He found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on the setting of the highest temperature, applicable population, and material safety of the long-established foot bath basin.
Generally speaking, foot baths do not have any electrical issues, but there is a possibility that some products may not have been thoroughly checked before leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose a detachable foot bath when purchasing.
Water and electricity are separated, so there is no safety hazard.
You can also take a digital pen to test at the same time.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headline View - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
The 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New-type Red Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center this morning, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-dollar tea industry.
Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Hou Shunli and Deputy Director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee Ye Hong attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Hong is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea injects new momentum into the "Five-Colored Xiang Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion yuan Xiang tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Waters and Five Colors Tea".
The tea industry within the province is increasing innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea and other main tea varieties taking turns to strengthen their efforts. The main tea producing areas are promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving increased income for the majority of tea farmers.
The winds of fortune turn, and red tea is gaining strength again.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round and the output value of tea gardens is increasing steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua applauded the "Source of Hunan Red".
At the Newhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, a Fujian tea merchant spotted a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
The Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association, Wang Zhun, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market more or less, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many bright spots.
Newhua Hongcha has a touch of red, infused with the connotations of tea culture, popular and hot in trading, and the Xiang tea industry welcomes a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can we cancel them?
No, thanks. He was unable to deliver it because there was no place to park below.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception, using rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is a fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The above is called the Way, the below is called the instrument" in the "Book of Changes • Transmission of the Above", which was translated from "metaphysic" by Japanese scholar Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era).
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extensions.
Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns represent only a concept.
Metaphysical naturalism, which refers to the denial of the existence of God.
The theoretical basis for this is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not take into account the existence of God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body, particularly the brain.
Dualism and Monism are the two main schools of thought when discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically thinks and researches about human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the rules of behavior accepted by a group of people or a culture.
Mainly divided into metaethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or criticism) and normative ethics (evaluating various different moral views and providing moral rule recommendations for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior people should adhere to, applies ethics (the academic discipline of applying ethical theories to practical situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and making generalizations from observed patterns).
It does not start from an anticipated theory of ethics, but rather investigates the actual moral agent's real choices that are made and observed, all the moral factors that lead to this decision, and the ethical views held by the social group.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, as well as medieval Christian ethics.

Ding Zilin: To my friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the past 30 years since the death of our family members, especially since I issued a humanitarian aid appeal in my own name to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and the assistance has not stopped since then.
Nowadays, most of the parents of the deceased have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their own families and jobs.
It was your kind deed that helped us families in distress to get through the most difficult times.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world, and most donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease humanitarian donations to the Tiananmen Mothers group, a humanitarian relief effort that should have been concluded long ago.
I will always remember your love and believe that your deeds will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid provided by the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian aid, the National Association for China's Democracy (NACD) and the Minnesota China Democracy Fund (MNCDF) are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.
Apple Daily Picture: Tao Ye is responsible for managing the Tiananmen Mothers website.
Relief funds often do not reach the hands of the Tiananmen Square victims smoothly.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund", which was implemented for 11 years until 2009, when all June 4th orphans had graduated from university. MCDF then established the "June 4th Poor Elderly and Special Difficult Households Relief Fund" and has been implementing it ever since.
The funding for these projects mainly comes from donations from campuses and society in 1989, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Democracy Foundation of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, we have also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
After 31 years, last year, the Tiananmen Square Massacre victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th incident.
During this period, China Rights also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding called off the June 4th donation out of consideration for the donors, who are mostly retired elderly people with incomes not as plentiful as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his "Letter to Friends".
We will respect the decision of the stakeholders to terminate the project within two years and to resume it immediately if necessary.
We express our gratitude and respect to those brave comrades who have been generous and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid for many years.

The photo effect: I took two outfits and overall it's not bad, I really like this set of pictures~
Service Details: The makeup artist and staff were very considerate because I was feeling a bit uncomfortable due to my pregnancy. They let me rest for a while and kept bringing me hot water to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the rabbit's review. I originally said that the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for the recognition, Dan Dan. Your satisfaction can energize us to keep going. We will keep up the good work!
This photography studio is really great! I highly recommend it to all my friends!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, it is impeccable.
The makeup artist is especially delicate, and can match a suitable makeup for you according to your style. The cosmetics used are also all top-brand ones.
Teacher Tian Liang doesn't need to be said, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens playing together.
We are working in Beijing, and the better photography studios in Beijing require you to line up half a year in advance. My colleague took some photos in Beijing, and after seeing the finished product, I thought it was just so-so.
I specially sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is not very good, feeling that this is also the case for most people. Photographer Liang Ge will take pictures and record the natural and wonderful moments.
A team of professional makeup artists, photographers, and post-production designers.
We and the people around us all praised it to the skies when it was finished.
I have already recommended my best friend to go, and she was just as delighted after seeing the negatives.
I hope such studios won't be buried and more people can discover them, so they can shoot with their own style instead of being generic.
We are very grateful for the five-star reviews from Zhenying and Jingling. Both of them are very creative newcomers. We are a creative studio and we will do our best to fulfill the customer's wishes as long as they like our work. Thank you for meeting us.
The sweet and caring assistant, as well as the lively and cheerful photography teacher, everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and an unforgettable experience, and the results were much better than I expected. Thank you everyone for your hard work. 😘😘
Thank you for the review, Xiao Yu. It's fate that we got to know each other. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust has been a journey of thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to have met you. I hope to have the chance to come back to Qinhuangdao to play next time.

If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself, after all, the money spent on training is very much, and it takes 6 months to learn.
If you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-discipline. Training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we need to look at the faculty strength of this institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, this training institution will not be meaningful. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Before making a selection, it is best to inquire about the training institution. It is also best to inquire about the students who have graduated from the institution, as only they can know how the institution is and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't given any information about your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with one's own situation.
For example, your profession, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, all of these will be related to the field you are studying or want to pursue.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer major who has graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-learning, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but one has a high learning cost, two requires a lot of time input, and basically requires concentrated training for 3-6 months.
If it's the cases I'm talking about, self-learning is very convenient. There are many free learning resources on the Internet now, or you can go to Bilibili for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through brief introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
Additionally, there are some classic books that can be combined with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but are willing to invest some money and time in learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way, you don't have to work too hard and the teachers will explain in detail. There are also people to answer questions, and it can also help with learning planning or supervision.
Nowadays, many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend students to companies after learning, so that the subsequent job interview process can save a lot of trouble.
Above are my thoughts. As I don't know your situation, I can only give a brief introduction, not a detailed one. If you have any other questions, you can contact me anytime for communication.
I said I would be there before 1 o'clock, I saw it in the app.

When we were young, happiness was something that we had when we had it; when we grew up, happiness was a goal that we achieved when we reached it; when we matured, we realized that happiness was actually a state of mind that we experienced when we understood it.
Be your most authentic and kind self, follow your heart, and live without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; two treasures in life: good health and good mood, live happily ever after!
Every stage of life comes with its own set of challenges.
Many times, what binds you is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it is better to face it with composure.
The more you fear, the more difficulties will knock you down; if you face the difficulties head-on, the problems will eventually be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators have joined forces to host the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News.
Xinhua News Agency reported on December 12th that the first Contemporary Art Biennial in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial exhibition is jointly curated by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Fei Yu, Director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, as Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial is "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabian social and cultural development.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting six units: "Feeling the Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Peripheral Thinking", "Towards the Public", "A Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Of the total number of exhibits, more than 40% are works by 27 Saudi artists, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly regarded, with some of them creating works in a novel way using recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's "Behind the Story Series: Endless Picture of Streams and Mountains" (2014), in which he reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
Buckly, CEO of the Diriyah Biennial Foundation, stated that he hopes this biennial will establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to have the opportunity to understand the culture industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia that is rapidly developing, and to strengthen the interaction between them.
Tanya Farouky said, "The goal of the Biennial is twofold: to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in a global dialogue, and to enable Saudi audiences to engage with the world of contemporary art."
It is reported that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the Biennale, and opinion leaders from artists, curators and the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Regulating the Management of Public Welfare Positions in Rural Areas - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Kunming, December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng): In order to continue to do a good job of helping the employment of people who have been lifted out of poverty and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies related to the management of public welfare posts in rural areas to promote rural revitalization and help promote rural revitalization in an all-round way.
The relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare posts to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken labor force, which plays an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people to increase their income, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly to unify the standards for the scope of personnel recruited for grassroots public welfare posts, fund management, post development, and post management.
In terms of position development and setting, the new regulations clearly stipulate that positions should be set according to the principles of "position setting according to demand, personnel assignment according to position, dynamic management, and overall quantity control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one person one position, voluntary openness, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and arrangement for on-the-job.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and require the relevant departments to purchase commercial accident insurance for personnel placed in rural public welfare posts; It is required that the relevant departments regularly supervise the subsidy payment of rural public welfare posts.

Hello
Can I cancel my order?
I reorder.
Have you cancelled it?
Although the right-wingers had their triumphant times in history, they were not long-lasting. Therefore, they were short-lived because they flourished with a bit of sunshine and perspired with a sip of water; they could look far beyond the horizon when they were successful, but they could be easily defeated and followed suit.
To be realistic, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right wing should not be denied in terms of defining truth standards since the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization of administration and protecting human rights.
As for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I pay attention to his words and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China and the social issues in China.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that counter-revolutionary forces are necessary, but revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, harm the people's livelihood, and create a chaotic political landscape with all kinds of forces vying for power. Furthermore, foreign powers will take advantage of the situation.
To change or improve China, we must have patience and a sense of responsibility to the country and its people. Those who attempt to take advantage of the situation for political gain are not right-wingers, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk some more.
Leftists are actually a group of outcasts from the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no chance, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Recently, I have seen some friends arguing with the villains while refuting the left-wing lunatics, which is quite stirring. I think it is unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with a traitor or a lunatic; they are both unreasonable and there is no point in trying to make them see reason.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about getting the opponents and the left-wingers to admit it. Why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the reactionaries call you a nickel and the leftists call you a rightist, it just proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have dreams when they are young, but when they grow old, they forget their dreams or become obsessed with pursuing them.
As ideals drift further away, even the dragon-slaying youth eventually becomes an evil dragon.
Left and right, I think generally refers to constraints and freedom. From the innate genetic of Chinese history and culture, the overall Chinese should be left-leaning.
Right-wingers in China emphasize efficiency and development, while left-wingers focus on strengthening regulation, fairness, and security.
Society as a whole now hopes for more emphasis on fairness, while the rivalry between China and the US is leaning left, which is a given, and is likely to continue for many years.
Even though I don't understand, just give it a like and it's done.
Nothing more to say, Flower Flower is so righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and siege of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "American-based" companies.
The US has been suppressing China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries' related companies to block China's chip industry at the same time, resulting in orders and profits of global chip suppliers being affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and decreased production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage and disruption of the global chip supply chain.
Now, the "chip shortage" has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies shutting down and phone prices rising, almost all industries that use chips have been severely affected.
In order to gain control of "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the Americans have recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries' giants to establish a Semiconductor Alliance, and subsidizing to support US domestic technology giants. For example, Intel, an old-fashioned technology giant of the US Empire, invested 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened up chip outsourcing business.
Most people believe that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to take away TSMC's "bread and butter".
The reason for this certainty is that Intel, as an old-school American tech giant, has been deeply cultivating the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of personnel and technical reserves, and will surely rise quickly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou disdainfully dismissed Intel's decision.
At the 2021 Master Think Tank Forum held in April, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement. Regarding Intel's investment in building a wafer factory, Zhang Zhongmou bluntly said: It is quite ironic that Intel is building a chip foundry.
Zhang Zhongmou was disdainful of Intel's foray into the wafer field because he still remembers the grudges between TSMC and Intel from more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the US manufacturing industry, occupying the peak position in the world and dominating the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were held by a few powerful players.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory, with Intel being the representative of that era.
However, this model puts a strain on some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are unable to afford the huge costs of setting up production lines.
Under the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became reality and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was born.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has targeted its main business to the single process of wafer fabrication, providing only outsourced manufacturing services without design.
At the time when TSMC was just established, it was a small fry compared to the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, so it decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel at the time was looking down on wafer fabrication services.
It is unexpected that the giants who looked down on semiconductor manufacturing services in the past now have to start doing semiconductor outsourcing.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into wafer fabrication was ironic.
Now TSMC's market value has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's aggressive attack, Intel naturally cannot remain stagnant.
Now, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
Wait no more.
I've been ordering for 2 hours now since 19:06 😅
Let's take a look at some "weird hot searches" today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly selecting three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Raising Head, Oreo Price Increase, and Huolala Incident, public opinion spread and formed a peak, then [index decreased] (smooth curve) and eventually dissipated. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump appearing again.
They look exactly the same as the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" that was displayed on the Cyberspace Administration of China's website.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in a "solitary peak", "sawtooth", and "cliff" shape.
"Peak" refers to artificially heating up quickly to get on the hot search list and attract public attention; "Sawtooth" refers to periodic heating up to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list; "Cliff" refers to collective withdrawal, when the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and is ready to move on to a new task and battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is exactly the trough of another event, with no time difference, which must be the unified batch of water soldiers receiving the task and launching a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black public relations is evident: dozens of hot searches on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which incite wars, which divert attention, which influence cognition, which mislead judgments, which stir emotions, which manipulate decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-grained warfare, almost taking into account all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science; without taking into account any subjective factors such as stance and emotion, even public relations will be helpless when faced with objective data.
Everyone leaves a mark when they pass by, and we will uncover these marks together.

Mauritius and other countries have reported their first cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain of the virus - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency reported on December 12th from Beijing that according to its overseas correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi recently reported their first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant, the Omikron Rong strain.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron Rho strain of the virus on the 10th of the month.
According to Health Minister Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th; the other infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30th after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of both infected persons have turned negative and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain.
These three people are all students, who returned from abroad at the beginning of this month. As they all have mild symptoms, they were not hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron Rho virus, the government is increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers over 12 years old who enter the country by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawian Health Minister Khumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country has recorded its first three cases of infection with the Omicron Rho strain.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 new coronavirus positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and found 3 cases of infection.

Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Garden, No. 156, Huancheng South Road
It was a friend's introduction, so I chose to come and take a look. Initially, my budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
They started a series of scams when they arrived at the store.
This is my first time visiting the store, I just showed them my floor plan, they didn't even measure the house, and they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000, they roughly showed me their materials but I don't know what brand they are.
Their second scam is that if you go to the store, they will drag you into paying a deposit (which you can never get back unless you have enough experience to fight them in court).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me how much discount I could get if I paid the deposit today.
This is a big scam, and I am a living example of being cheated. In a moment of impulse, I paid a deposit of more than ten thousand.
His quote to me had many issues - 70,000 does not include water and electricity renovation, does not include any doors and cabinets, and bathrooms, and these three are the major expenses for basic installation.
The service fees they charge are higher than those of other companies, even after taking these into account.
I have lost trust in this company, as they had me sign a contract without explaining anything at first.
When I went to get my money back from them, they acted very experienced, with a special team to deal with me.
No matter what, the customer's problem will be bitten off and they are completely blameless.
There are various attempts to shift responsibility, and many details that I don't want to talk about one by one, all of which are tears. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house that they renovated was also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees afterwards.
They are the same scammers who used to be called Longtou Decoration, now they changed to Da Mei, and now it seems like they have closed down and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a crappy decoration company.
In the future, when making choices, everyone should do more research and consult these experts, because renovation is not a small expense.
To ask a question to the merchant, please log in or register first.
It is strictly forbidden to post any form of merchant reviews. Please refer to the merchant inclusion statement for details.
The Dianping Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration. For finding a decoration company, go to Dianping.
If it's so scary, please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Okay, don't cancel this conversation then, if you don't refund my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.

The starry sky has an appointment | The Gemini Meteor Shower will reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua News
New China News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy popular science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini Meteor Shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of that day.
Beijing Astronomy Enthusiasts Anjiu photographed the Gemini Meteor Shower on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is currently the second known meteor shower not to be "fostered" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society Director and Astronomy Popularization Expert Xiu Lipeng introduced that, just like a New Year's movie, the Gemini Meteor Shower generally appears at the end of the year, with its "showing period" lasting from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, along with the Geminids and the Perseids.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies move slowly, with a variety of colors, and there are also many fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Yang Jing, a Tianjin astronomy enthusiast, captured the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2020 in Jizhou, Tianjin.
The astronomical forecast shows that the Geminid meteor shower this year will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (Zenithal Hourly Rate, the number of meteors seen per hour under ideal observing conditions with the radiant at the zenith) of 150.
The Twins Meteor Shower Recommendation Index Chart.
Last year, the Gemini meteor shower "Luo Ying Bin Fen" left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered by moonlight, and the level of excitement will be discounted.
On the 14th of the lunar calendar, it is the 11th of November and the moon phase is a waxing gibbous. The bright moonlight will interfere with observation, but fortunately the moon will set in the later part of the night. At this time, the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after midnight when the moon sets, but be sure to keep warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing northeast in the suburbs or countryside. Then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe it with the naked eye.
It is important to note that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't need to keep your eyes fixed on the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography should choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens to capture beautiful 'meteor shower' shots. Use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Considering stability and continuity, a tripod, spare battery, and shutter release cable are also essential.
Peng Xiuli reminded us.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
In my understanding, the traditional television mentioned by the questioner should refer to LCD TVs, and the difference in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared to the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or in other words, laser TVs are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV sizes range from 55 inches to 65 inches, while the sizes of laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users' needs for large-screen TVs.
In recent years, the shipment and sales of laser TVs have been increasing globally, and they account for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyi Kang's forecast, in 2020, the sales of laser TVs will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain a high growth rate.
The reason for the good performance in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute's Saixi Laboratory and ophthalmologists from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital conducted a strict comparison test of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions for a group of people, resulting in 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have strong eye protection characteristics and even have certain improvement effects in certain aspects.
Nowadays, with more and more emphasis being placed on eye health, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuously decreasing prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually climbing.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, which can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, with little space required and a small and compact host, occupying very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
In addition to having lower heat generation, resulting in less wear and tear on the equipment, televisions also have a longer lifespan.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, biomimetic screen, etc., which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It's not about pseudo-requirements, but rather the product of requirement decomposition. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not the dish of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has its pros and cons, and you can make your own judgment after weighing them. Just be careful not to listen to one-sided words.
In short, ultra-wide angle short-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to be close to the screen, have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To block out some ambient light, using a microstructured Fyner screen is expensive; the price of an 80-inch screen is basically enough to buy a 65-inch LCD.
I also hate it when projector manufacturers use "good for your eyes" as a selling point for diffusion. Please, the light on the screen that your eyes can see is direct light. If you diffuse it onto the ceiling, your eyes can't see it either. Even LCD TVs are "directly diffused", isn't the ceiling illuminated when you turn on the TV?
And if the projection screen isn't diffuse, it won't look good at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high gain screen was overlooked, and when a large amount of light was reflected into the eyes from a certain angle, that was really uncomfortable.
The Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery has not yet opened any branches, but they have a selection of quality stores.
After I added her on WeChat to make an appointment, the lady sent me a list of available times and she replied to my messages promptly.
Before going, I looked at the store's shooting works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.
When I arrived that day, I had a brief conversation with the salesperson about my ideas. She was very patient and helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with. Finally, I decided to start with the makeup and styling. The photographer would set up props and guide the poses before taking the photos, and he was very meticulous about the details.
But maybe because we didn't communicate specific shooting ideas, the style of the photos wasn't what I wanted, but it should still look nice 🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help to select the photos and discuss the post-production style. They seem to be very attentive.
It will take about half a month to repair the film, so just wait and see the results~
I won the photography-themed "king's meal" activity for the second time~ Most of the clothes in the store can be chosen for a photoshoot.
In the end, I chose a black chiffon dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process will take about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer responsible for the shooting is the younger brother of the 95s. He feels a bit inexperienced, so I hope he can give more advice on customer shooting guidance in the future. He is quite talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.
The Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery selects quality stores.
Let's go to the homepage and take a look at Queenie too!
First fill in your name and phone number at the store, then choose the clothes. You can choose wedding dresses, and they were very patient when I tried on three or four sets of clothes. After choosing, they did my makeup for a long time and the service attitude was good. Later, they taught me how to pose for the photos, but the photos made my face look big. They said it would take half a month to edit, but I received it in three or four days and it didn't seem to be much different from the original.
The overall environment is good.
There are many choices of clothing.
There are roughly three makeup locations, inside of which is a photography studio.
The service is very friendly and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also take the time to teach you the poses seriously.
If the customer is not satisfied, the photographer will offer to take additional photos.
Experience: The original double eyelids may have been over-styled, resulting in three eyelids.
I also got my eyebrows trimmed, which is a bit awkward for me since I don't usually wear eyebrows.
The photos were given ten days ago, but the photoshopped effect wasn't very satisfactory; it still looks very obvious that double eyelids were pasted on.
Because I wasn't sure what style I wanted, I tried two sets. After looking back and forth, I still chose the black dress. The lady said this set was more of a Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me. The result was very satisfactory.
After getting my makeup and hair done, we started taking pictures. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the process, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After taking the photos, I carefully selected four of my favorites to be edited. The guy said he would finish the job within 15 minutes and I was very satisfied with the outcome.
It has been 3 days without a response... I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# Plus monthly plan because your system is unable to recognize my credit card!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card for payments.
I have to pay for shipping every time now.
Can I be exempted first and you can collect my monthly fee after you finish the investigation? Is that okay?
Should I buy insurance for my small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
According to the conditions set, to become an insurance broker company, three key words must be met: shareholders, the initiator must have no major violations in the past three years, the minimum limit is RMB 50 million, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually very strict. In summary, they require strength, approval from the national authority department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks nationwide), and good conduct from shareholders. As an insurance broker, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance, policyholders do not need to question whether Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is regular or not, after all, these three thresholds are not something that any insurance company can reach.
On this point, it is not bad and is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched He Tai Super Mary 5 Critical Illness Insurance. The claim party and the insurer are both He Tai Life Insurance. Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of business personnel, the general cost-effectiveness of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment mode is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's still very good.
English: Consider it.
In terms of the professionalism of the insurance agents: this is especially important, as insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many customers of internet products can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health declarations and occupations, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective opinions when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which can easily lead to many potential claims risks and the risk of being denied a claim.
I have done insurance telemarketing on "Tencent Weibao" (similar to Xiaoyusan, an internet insurance brokerage platform) and was very responsible in informing everyone.
The insurance on the internet is real and reliable, but it is the people who are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in the internet channels, and there are also a lot of sales misguidance.
For example, 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buying insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important and focus on the trivial, they will not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month needs to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, many customers do not know what they have bought after deducting fees for one or two years.
You can spend one dollar and the insurance company will pay out six million (the world is your oyster).
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888. If you win and receive a text message, you will not be reminded to redeem it if you do not do so yourself.
This is another pitfall for the insured - free coverage of 60,000 RMB for critical illness, which is short-term. If there is no other commercial insurance and a critical illness occurs, 60,000 RMB won't be enough to solve the problem, and life will start to become difficult.
The government is cracking down on the misleading of internet insurance sales currently.
In conclusion, there is no problem with the platform or the product, but there is a problem with the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the poster consider carefully and comprehensively, as many offline insurance broker companies have a wider range of products, giving customers more opportunities and choices. Some of their products also have better cost-effectiveness than internet products.
I have helped 59 internet customers myself, underwriting offline products, with each person saving 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
I am an insurance broker from Mingya Insurance with 3 years of corporate management training experience, having served nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will customize insurance products based on customer needs. During insurance, I will compare and contrast different insurance companies to get the best underwriting result for the customer. After insurance, I will help the customer organize and manage the policy, so that the customer can be worry-free.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can be of help to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is an insurance business where the policyholder can complete all the insurance process independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either; all steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although there may not be much of a "ceremony" when purchasing internet insurance, and even no printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to a "telephone sales" assembly line type of operation, but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance this way - the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades. Should we take it seriously when we purchase insurance and consider if the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
How can I contact the delivery specialist?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that supposed to be compensation for me?
I said to knock on the door for delivery.
The rider left it at the door and then the person left.
Still sent wrong
Our rider has picked up my takeout at #NUMBER#, but I'm still being told it's waiting.
The rider received my takeout at 19:25, but still refuses to leave.
Have I bought everything, or do you need any other takeout?
What should we do?
Where did your rider go?
Do we have to wait any longer?
I am here to make a delivery.
Okay, if you don't cancel, I will call the police.
But my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

No problem, remember no need to arrange for resending, I have already purchased another one, don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of defamation and cursing, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
Since you started sending me friend requests on Facebook and then posting sarcastic posts, to your attempt to post my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a stance of not responding.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some of my subtle and humiliating words, appearance, figure, good health, and bed planting strawberries, whether to insert or not, on Facebook with your so-called friends. I... just forget it.
I later found out that many of my friends had sent me a photo of you from your Facebook account, along with comments containing sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer stay silent.
After my news of reporting the police was uploaded, you didn't restrain yourself at all, instead you became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society, respect between the two sexes is needed.
Yes, you can continue this kind of sarcastic, subtle, humiliating, and insulting language, you can also continue to say you are just caring and concerned about me, you can continue to think this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it was not your making of the picture or continue to post all offensive comments.
Right, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my looks and figure don't need you to comment on them.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself for fame.
A friend asked me, "How are you doing?"
You won't believe it even if I say so.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like that.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who don't even have basic morality would choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of people.
I have cut out some of the comments for everyone to consider.
No one should be able to impersonate you on the post you sent out yourself, right?
I can only say that you are a civilized public enemy.

Vietnam People's Newspaper Online - Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh attends the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two major conferences were held during the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, discussing topics around digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development in the post-epidemic period of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic.
Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung stated that in 2021, despite the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number and revenue of Vietnamese digital technology companies still maintained a growth momentum of nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam has cultivated a large number of typical digital products, focusing on solving the major problems facing Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing the country's digital transformation platform and take on the task of developing these national digital platforms as a national mission.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are researching, developing, applying and transferring digital technology shared mobilization and gathering of all social resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, join hands to promote the country's digital transformation, and various breakthrough ideas and solutions for post-epidemic economic recovery such as Huihui.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is the way of the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services benefit everyone, so it is necessary to mobilize everyone to participate.
People and businesses are the core, main body, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the people and businesses.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation should embody the national spirit, and should be mainly driven by internal forces, with strategies, long-term and decisive factors, and external forces as important and breakthrough points.
He also believes that digital transformation should drive deeper and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome the phenomenon of natural resource depletion, help green transformation, and develop green energy.
Digital transformation must involve the establishment of databases to protect and promote national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs and practices, etc., and promote the digital transformation of banking, taxation, land management and development databases, as well as logistics and other fields.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous and developed.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng has called for increased leadership and guidance from all levels of government, institutions, and enterprises in the development of digital technology, raising awareness of digital transformation, continuing to formulate and improve systems for digital transformation, strengthening national governance, and promoting the development of digital technology enterprises with a spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity, and initiative.
During the forum, Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh attended the 2021 "Vietnam Made" Outstanding Digital Product Award Ceremony and the opening ceremony of the "Vietnam Made" Digital Product Exhibition.
I have reported and attached pictures, but there has been no response.

Here there is a wide selection of home appliances and electronics with many brands, including well-known ones.
On Double Twelve, I went to the Hansdon Water Purifier Store to look at water purifiers. There was a promotion going on inside the store with discounted prices.
Home of the Incredible has 11 floors, from -2 to 9, -1 and -2 are parking spaces, and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are not great, there are few restaurants and hardware stores, and the food tastes average.
This elevator is also very speechless, just like a big illness, going back and forth between negative two and negative one, no matter how many times I press this floor, it's still very speechless, it directly goes to a furniture store, but the furniture store is closed, so I can't get out of the safety passage!
Home Depot still needs to be improved, there are many areas that have not been developed.
Address: No. 555, Gaotie North Road, Shayibake District, with convenient transportation and a large parking lot, free of charge during the day.
The environment: To be honest, the store is huge, with 8-9 floors, and you can buy furniture, home appliances, and all kinds of small things that you want from home. Many famous brands have settled in the store, such as Mushi, Oppo, Huadi, Laoban, Fengchuangzhijia, Hansdun, Yak, Youbang, Silian, Fupinju, Wanjiale, Nature, Zhonglian, Midea, Yadan...

The mainstream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of water green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua News Agency
New China News Agency, Wuhan, December 11th (Reporter Wang Xian): The Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service area officially put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was officially put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water-based green comprehensive service zone has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Ministry of Transport Jiang River Navigation Administration Deputy Director Qiu Jianhua introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have established 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the Yangtze River vessel pollutant reception and shipping service capacity have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services to ships and crew, helping them to solve the "urgent distress" problem.
Two water-based green comprehensive service areas have been built and put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. They integrate life services, production services and government services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and emergency rescue services as the characteristics. The "one-time mooring and multiple services" in the port will make the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
English: Satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal is making a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform of the Chinese think tank, on January 9th, a satellite discovered the US Navy's USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic stronghold on the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform expects the USS Carl Vinson to deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft.
The US Navy is currently sailing in the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, which departed from the US on January 3rd.
The USS Lincoln also hosted the first F-35C squadron, which is part of the US Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan carrier, docked in Yokosuka, Japan, deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Shangpulan Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stoke Dar" etc.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
On January 17, 2022, US Navy carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B flew a route around China, visiting the rare and powerful weapon of Guam. (Tweet from @SouthChinaSeaStrategicSituationAwareness)
According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal visited Guam last weekend, an unusual occurrence. (Source: Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception)
The USS Nevada, a nuclear-powered Ohio-class submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, arrived at the US Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
Three US aircraft carriers have gathered around China, making a rare visit to Guam, the strongest weapon in the region. Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by an American ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The US Navy's three aircraft carriers have gathered around China, the strongest weapon making a rare visit to Guam. In recent years, China has been building a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands.
The picture is of Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
The US Navy stated in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrating the US's capability, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are usually referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Rumbling Submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the "Boomer" the most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad, which also includes land-based launch silos for ballistic missiles, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
I was talking to a friend about Meta recently dropping 26%, with a market cap evaporating of $251 billion, and Mark Zuckerberg responding that they are "facing unprecedented competition". What could be the reason for this?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenue primarily coming from advertising. Today, advertising companies make money by having their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and more - no matter what the feature positioning is, they are all traffic channels for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's advertising, and it is through Meta's advertising platform that monetization is achieved.
But times have changed.
First, due to Apple's adjustment of its privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, clearly prompting users whether to allow an App to access their information. Most people's normal reaction would definitely be to not allow it.
If Google sticks another knife in, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies contributing to the maritime business.
Meta has about a hundred people in its office in Hong Kong, and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, so most of the money is spent on Meta.
It is interesting that ByteDance's TikTok is now one of Meta's main competitors, yet Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All the domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise at Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
Recently I haven't specifically looked into it, but it definitely won't be better than before.
Chinese companies have passed the stage of burning money on a large scale overseas.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are no longer in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at income, but more importantly looks at how the future expectations are.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "Metaverse".
The primordial universe should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the realization cycle of the primordial universe is relatively long, so this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current success, with annual revenues of $10-20 billion, there is a strong sense of crisis within the company. Compared to other internet companies and high-tech firms, there is no real safety net for Facebook.
Although his several social software now have a high daily activity and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, and the overthrow is just a blink of an eye.
Attempting to create a universe that is out of reach in the short term is very risky for Facebook, which is why Mark Zuckerberg changed the company's name and is constantly looking for new avenues. However, I think his choice of avenues is wrong and is a dead end. These are my thoughts for your reference.
