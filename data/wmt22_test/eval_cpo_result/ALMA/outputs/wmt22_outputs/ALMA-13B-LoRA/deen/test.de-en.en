The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# large customer, so this is not a problem for me.
I simply need a number or instruction as to what I should include with the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179 euros.
Honestly, I find this very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get the credit?
I also believe that children should not be made to take on the role of a parent for their younger siblings.
However, I think it's good for older siblings to look after the little ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, give a quick hand, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help out in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I see no problem with that.
If your K1 is happy to be alone for a short time, that's fine.
You can best judge for yourself whether this is suitable for your children.
It's not as if he's supposed to wrap up K2 and accompany him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is why the psychologist made this statement.
After all, if something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember a few years ago reading a crime / thriller novel and I can remember almost the entire plot, but I can't remember the title for the life of me - maybe someone here knows?
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself in food and going into his raptor enclosure.
The case is taken over by a detective who, after a short investigation, gets involved with his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats anxious patients.
The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is hired anonymously before every suicide to go to the site of the suicide and document it and post the photos online.
Anyway, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where the patients have chips implanted in their brains that suppress an anxiety centre and the patients end up facing their fears in the most extreme way.
A woman jumps out of a window, another drives herself to death.
Facing the fear is called "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital that had to do with a fire.
That's the basic plot, and I'm pretty sure the original book was written by a French author.
If anyone recognises this action or even knows the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh dear, I don't have the WiFi password.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What should I do next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
4-year-old boy has splinter under thumb nail
A four-year-old child has wood splinters under the fingernail (outer side).
They tried to pull him out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance anymore.
Tomorrow I'm going to the doctor.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to push through booster vaccination
Politics and science in Great Britain are constantly beset with new cases of the Omicron variant.
By New Year's Eve, therefore, all eligible adults in England should be offered a vaccination.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster than previously planned with the booster vaccinations against the coronavirus in the face of rapidly rising Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to get a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since their second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to the nation on Sunday evening.
Until now, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omicron variant, we are facing an emergency, so the vaccination protection must be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the protection level can be raised again with a third vaccination.
“Get boosted now,” Johnson said.
Another 1,239 Omicron cases were recorded in the UK on Sunday, taking the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price at collection?
I'm for everyone using pronouns
I sent in an application.
Today, an invitation to a meeting was sent by email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled it and it's either a man or a woman depending on their cultural background.
**I have no idea how to write this email now.
Can someone please help me?
**I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any officials' toes.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have five books in total.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today is not
Apparently, the chair had an undetectable defect at the time of sale.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
I first tried the #PRS_ORG#.
This has been working for about
No longer 14 days.
So I have bought the last few books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
They are now back in stock and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me.
CW: The feeling of not being able to help.
Content warning: I'm going to get into some detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really gnaws at me and, unfortunately, is all too common is that many victims do not want to be helped or think that we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue marks, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-to-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, is that everyone deserves to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help, but I know I can't.
But it will never be easy.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so unbelievably important.
Arcane on Netflix: How good is the series based on League of Legends?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two series?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach, John Patrick, had said about the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
However, this did not settle down after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
More than the bare result, the manner of the performance disappointed.
As an example, a statistic can be mentioned that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point percentage was just 13 percent, 4 shots (all by the young Johannes Patrick) at 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer came from John Patrick: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory in Tenerife and did not implement what we trained".
Which is to move the ball.
His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, reacted very differently: "It's a great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like 10,000 people.
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game of his team.
“The best playmaker I have ever trained,” praised Gleim.
While Patrick's own stars like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) struggled across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points, after they were already 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for hesitation.
Already on Wednesday (7 p.m.), the giants will receive the Skyliners from Frankfurt, with a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I contacted them a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have sought legal advice and have written to them again for this reason.
We originally contacted them half a year ago.
Always on the ball: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
He is currently on tour with the programme "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
In fact, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on the instructions of the authorities" to contain the coronavirus.
His other planned appearances in the run-up to Christmas have also been cancelled, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
In January, the artists then want to make up for their cancelled dates in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has sung a lot and often since his youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of Schlager and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with her blonde hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer absent from the current German-speaking music scene.
Since 2020, he has been on tour with the programme "Good day, dear luck". dpa

It still doesn't work, I can only see the cover but not turn the pages.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
“With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes,” said Geywitz in an interview with the “Tagesspiegel” (Sunday).
My aim is to give tenants the security that their rent will remain affordable in the years ahead.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is actually the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out further tightening of the rental law in talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition.
The coalition agreement envisages a rent cap until 2029, a cap on rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak to the Justice Secretary to get this done as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax anyway, "we will talk with our coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has spawned numerous tornadoes across the US.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 people could be dead.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
In the night from Friday to Saturday, several tornadoes wreaked havoc in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred victims.
The storms left a roughly 200-mile path of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster zone that "everything is gone" where the tornado hit.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
Alone in the state of Kentucky, he expects up to a hundred deaths, with official figures rising hourly.
Hi, I just saw that they're sold out of Vitrine #NAME#.
That's a shame.
Is it still produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
until when do you register?
If the delivery cannot be made to my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I now order the ceiling and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I used the contact form to return an item or request a return, and I wanted to ask whether it was received or processed, as I have not received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees money bonuses for getting vaccinated.
They are in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Even the transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - following the German model - is intended to increase the willingness to have a Corona vaccination.
He has moved to a company he slated.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It was a year ago.
He obviously didn't stick to his old position and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: so what?
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I take a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Hello Boron!
I'm currently running an adventure over the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends, and I'd like to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts devised, and now I'm writing the introductory adventure and I'm already tripping over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are transporting a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
This is where the story continues.
Some miles from the village, the heroes are ambushed by a group of goblins, luring them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: persuade, act, threaten, recognise the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group size: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords
Lurking unseen, the goblins ambush the heroes in a ditch and flank them on either side with three to the left and three to the right with bows, while two with spears stop the wagon.
Should it come to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions
1. The heroes all fall unconscious and are then found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart, of course, is gone.
2. If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf uses two of his servants and comes to the aid of the hero in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is fine.
What do you think of Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much of an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will later play an important role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take on board many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would still like to send them back
If you can then get the receipts back, I can pack the lamp and take it to the #PRS_ORG#.

I'm fed up with Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality of German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the start accident meant that the schedule was far behind the plan, they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, it is the case that, for legal reasons, F1 takes precedence and everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice here.
Still dumb, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race.
Still, a little praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes did a good job of accompanying the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then, in F1, the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher showed their ignorance of the rules again, not knowing that you can change tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation has happened in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change his tyres when there were radio messages about this to Hamilton.
Both Sky UK and RTL commentators knew immediately that this was an option for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that such basic rules should simply be known if you comment on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster.
It is also not the first time there has been speculation about what is now possible or required according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties about the rules.
In general, Roos' artificial commentary style does not appeal to me, but it is a matter of taste.
But I actually prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
On top of that, there are constant jokes that just make both of them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
In particular, the latter brings total chaos to the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the final round Sky is the only broadcaster to go into advertising, as can be heard at F1TV, where only the German soundtrack without commentary is available directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
These two broadcasters also make less advertising in training than Sky, and that as free-TV broadcasters.
While I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's schedule is also very thin and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster of F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
In this way, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it could be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to know your opinion.
This one: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and coloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it was going out on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday she was going to check and send it and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are ideal to supply an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using an air pump.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can compare the services.
If the pumps are powerful enough, you can operate entire plants with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model, but a fan pump can also be used to make an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that turns the air bubbles into a function.
This would be a treasure chest, shell, or something similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction, which results in low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected via an air hose of 4/6 mm to an outlet o.ä. ... and then it can start.
The fan pump should be at the same level, or higher than the water level and mounted externally.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent the water from ever flowing backwards through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture.
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that consume little energy
Even though we state a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack every day and the parcels are also collected every day.
If everything runs smoothly, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take a little precaution so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer once.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics sector...of course, no Corona stops here.
Please do not rate us badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Naturally, people like to moan about these services, even though at the moment we're saying... they've got it tough
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry at anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in white here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and TV host into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The ten-minute flight took off and landed in the western part of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos himself greeted the newly crowned astronauts upon their return.
Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Cheered on by friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were 10 minutes and 13 seconds underway and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honour at the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his missions.
She was simply along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also impressed.
He would like to go back into space as soon as possible, the moderator said.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometres high
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely autonomously.
The capsule, which was jettisoned from the rocket during flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers (62 miles) above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was slowed by large parachutes and landed.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned spaceflight: The first in July saw Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, included the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics have accused Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
By pressing a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently shine in one colour or play through its entire colour palette.
Set to colour change, the light stone will hold a colour for around a minute before gently changing to the next decorative colour.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light fixture proves itself all year round outdoors.
In snowy surroundings, its light is particularly effective - only a shorter light duration is to be expected when the days get shorter.
In winter, please make sure that no snow does not impair the function of the solar module.
The "Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon (AA) format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.

Someone who works in or studies biochemistry
I am currently in my first semester of biochemistry and I actually find the subject quite interesting and the lab work does not bother me (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
Of course, I also looked into career prospects before starting my studies, but at the time I also thought that I would definitely want to study until my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially concerning my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) one hears again and again about great career prospects and the profession is in great demand, on the other hand one hears again and again about unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid jobs.
So I would really like to know:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you happy with your job/salary?
3) What did you study/what qualifications do you have?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thanks for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment and am considering dropping out of my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experience with this, feel free to write about it.
Extra stress before holidays and weekends
This topic came up for me last week.
But I had to use my long weekend to relax from that.
That's why there's a post now.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
Apparently, it's also available during holidays and bridge days.
It was so: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-official.
So last week there was a long four-day weekend.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
So many e-mails that absolutely had to go out before Pentecost, order here, order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... well, why?
Because "next week then" sounds like it's been a long time and that's not allowed?
Or because people really want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed.
What is this self-hostage-taking for holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent.
My question is simply: Are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know this in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't bought any presents yet.
The nice thing is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer of Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the festive spirit by baking and crafting with her son.
I love that, said Catterfeld.
However, until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I haven't bought any presents yet, I have to get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the moult and the formation of new feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage in aviculture is exclusively due to dietary errors.
As the plumage consists of protein-containing substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the molt are due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate vitamin and mineral intake.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feedstuffs is specifically taken into account and balanced.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thanks, I found it
Still does not work
East German handicraft model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railroader ME issue 11/1968, used with play marks and missing parts, the function is good, the E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, perhaps the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is operational
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to transport 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h.
A top speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG ordered the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a Tatzlager drive from AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part and the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Reichsbahn repair works in Dessau, the restoration potential of all six locomotives was confirmed.
The three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled in 1959 due to the increasing demand for locomotives for the heavy freight service as the Mitteldeutsche Netz was being electrified. The other locomotives were used as spare parts.
To begin with, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were given priority.
It was only when it became clear that the E 94 would not be able to increase the recovery rate any further that the E 95 came into focus.
The locomotives were initially stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to Halle P in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate timetable in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic.
As a result, shooters often got stuck in the switches.
Then the attendant, who was always on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and wooden wedge to loosen the wheels during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months of downtime for the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives, and there were no plans for a significant expansion of the electric operation, so the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splinter groups, so that the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition to this, the German Reichsbahn only wanted to staff their electric locomotives with one man, which would have been a problem in train operations due to the difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in mid-1969, the E 95 01 followed as the last on 5 October 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all the locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating device on the main station in Halle.
It took some time for those in charge at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external processing of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive is cared for in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the museum depot in Arnstadt with a new inner and outer paint job. The transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
The locomotives were in service on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved their reliability and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945, the machines were moved to Leipzig to the central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in original packaging, in good working order, optical repairs to the locomotive are required in your own workshop, dusty, with play marks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
Packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle bar is held by two feet...unfortunately, these are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't put the bed together.
The middle bar is supported by two feet, unfortunately these are faulty.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
No, no flat ones.
These are the right ones from the shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they fulfil their purpose
For me, they are not flat
Could I get these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
Furthermore, an estimated six-figure damage was caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to hospital on Sunday with light smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But that comes much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To dispel fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Uğur Şahin, the head of Biontech, has so far not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had moved him, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the network "LinkedIn" on Friday.
For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated in an effort to combat these false rumors.
So far, he has rejected this, because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin.
He did not ask about the reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
“It is currently not legally possible for me to get the vaccine myself,” Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritisation in Germany for the administration of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritisation has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has had himself vaccinated three times, according to his own statements.
Fire in transformer station: tens of thousands of people without power
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had disabled a transformer station.
After a fire with heavy damage in a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several communities due to the fire.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption was finally completely repaired late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the Technical Relief Service provided support in the communities.
Authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood help.
The supplier thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant disruption.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will take several days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to put some of the lines back into operation temporarily, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
The fire that broke out on Friday at around 7.15 pm damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
There is a need for extensive cleaning and repair work there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply has been restored.
Since 6pm on Saturday, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 21.30.
Since 23.15, the last people affected by the outage also have electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were involved.
The authorities had also called for neighbourhood help after setting up emergency power supplies for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
It is now important that the citizens take care of older or single people in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire stations if help is needed, explained Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not care for themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical devices, or who were dependent on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG# day blanket in blue-green.
I hope you also have a nice day and stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the undercarriage on the tabletop.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops of #NUMBER#
We got a 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push them together and thus shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they would otherwise not be suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate feedback
Yes, that is really easier!
Then let's do it!
Could you please send me the return slip by email?
Repairs are now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find it almost insulting to receive such a low credit.
We do not agree with this
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to give way again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the race with a large lead after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both upgraded to version 4.5 ...
they might have heard about problems before
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it, I get the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
If the file is corrupted, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the parts with a little soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Drag the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
A slight overlap of the colour layers later creates a smooth surface.
Avoid swiping the brush back and forth quickly.
This creates unrealistic-looking areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the lighter colors.
The dark ones could otherwise show through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, ugly metal streaks can occur if they are mixed with normal colours.
Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve their original appearance through the decals or transfers.
From emblems on aircraft to ship names to decorative strips and license plates on model cars: Decals give the model that final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still accessible.
An aircraft cockpit is easier to cover before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than having the right tools, such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks, is having time, patience and a steady hand when applying.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them to your liking.
Decals are also called water slides because you wet the back of them briefly with water until the carrier paper turns dark.
Then you just push the picture a little bit away from the paper and put the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you also moistened before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, peel the backing paper away from the side.
Caution: Always check to make sure the picture is sitting right before you push it all the way off the paper so it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle, or tear.
Suck up the excess water with a household cloth.
Not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book for a short time when I look at something else, then I can't read the book anymore and I have to log out and log in and reload the book and find the place where I stopped reading.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I get this by email?
And for all three packages?
After all, the lamp came to me in three separate packages.
OK, thank you anyway!
then I will buy somewhere else when the money comes back.
But can I get it back easily?
Treatment for infertility in private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for a while, and now that it comes to billing the private health insurance, it suddenly puts up a fight.
In order:
We had applied for fertility treatment in advance with the PKV and received approval for three attempts.
The trials were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was invoiced by the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not include these in the PKV.
We again applied for cost coverage with the PKV and were again granted three more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more attempts than we were promised, of course), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV will only reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first offer expire.
The second child is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts here are:
Who is right here, the PKV (only three attempts are reimbursed) or us (five attempts are to be reimbursed)?
* Would the PKV have had to point out to us in the promises that the further attempts would lapse with a birth?
*Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Thanks in advance for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can reach them again?
Fine.
We will never order from them again.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost a good customer.
They are welcome to pass this on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't do anything about the fact that the chest of drawers completely disturbs me
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote
It's clear and obvious that the refund was initiated and I still haven't received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the fault only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
In any case, the warranty is 24 months.
No, I am not able to obtain another type of packaging.
I will dismantle the wardrobe and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional chairs, which we unfortunately cannot find at your place.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
What exactly a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
There are plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to find out the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you
Yours sincerely
If there is no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll soon give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
“Half victory” against Belarus with high costs for the EU
The EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation in a sustainable way, explained the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP).
This limbo state - Belarus is not quite giving in, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for some time.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
There appears to be an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole has not decided against it, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens the cohesion in the Union.
It is apparently unable to assert itself when a member state decides to do its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its border policy with Belarus, says Bossong: An agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
Meanwhile, according to Poland's Border Guard, migrants have again tried to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested in the night to Sunday and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza.
According to reports, one soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU or tried to do so in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko as the ruler of Minsk of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that brought migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people in order to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard gloves and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account the internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not used to the fact that the security apparatus regularly shuttles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second protest was lodged against the result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and rushed to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre came shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I check that.
I am speaking to the bank and will call you back
thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park is holding a SC Freiburg Fantag
The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were able to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars glowed red and white on this day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," the park said.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park has again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing smiling fans enjoying the rollercoaster together confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is the €#NUMBER# and not like the original 1699€?

Sorry, but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite does not mean anything.
This is like when an AfD supporter says he has nothing against foreigners.
They won't admit to their i's.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just leave it out completely.
Yes, wow, then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who fundamentally questions evolution is completely lost.
As far as I'm concerned, God started it all.
But once you're a creationist you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
To get the best field of view, the magnifier should be as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifier virtually error-free in the entire field of view.
Lenses are often marked with magnification values.
However, these figures only apply to exactly defined conditions, which are rarely the same as the conditions of use.
To get the most out of your magnifier, please follow the instructions in the table "Technical Data" (See user manual in the packaging).
Light reflections appear on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact lenses.
The reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflection coating.
Under optimal use conditions - the lens close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
More information can be found in the enclosed user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: Women in Krembz are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations when selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year, he plants about 2000 of them.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
This makes the run-up to Christmas a bit more fun, he says.
And what about the voucher?
Otherwise, I'm out as a customer!
At least I received a defective delivery and now have to pay the full price for it.
Then I will also rate it accordingly!
We don't need to debate which is the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "turner", which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with fibre + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems setting up a stable WiFi network.
Prior to this, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which has worked flawlessly to receive and send 50 Mbit, with the exception of a few outages.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives these.
However, at the other DLan module, which sends out the WiFi, the full 500 do not come through, but the more I move away from the module in the house, the less comes through (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fibre connection is now even slower in the first floor (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost with fibre optic cables over the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really at my wit's end, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more delighted to receive an answer.
When it's time to change your current account
Those who thought that now there would be peace with the current accounts were mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to trick their customers into confirming the fee increases of the past, the exemption limits for negative interest rates are also falling.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has simply halved and even quartered the allowance for savings accounts.
In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank subsidiary - to 50,000 euros for current and savings accounts and 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
However, these lower thresholds now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks now have a free allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which won in the first instance at the Berlin District Court against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should perhaps set aside reserves - in case the higher courts declare negative interest rates to be unlawful and many millions of bank customers have to be reimbursed.

Jennifer Aniston has a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like a rollercoaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of her appearance.
At least, so Aniston, she allows herself a chip a day (yes, that's right: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
That the hearts of female and male fans alike are won over is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with luck - and is still looking for the great love.
And crossed off the baby wish list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who ask that don't know what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame also make people happy.
Unworthy end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled off his gloves and wiped sweat from his brow.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the band, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" is ending his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the world championship in 2007 with Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix races, started 18 times from pole position and was on the podium 103 times.
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The goal of the bobsledder is the mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes.
“I’ve worked out that I’d need to win nine and a half races a season to make it to Cortina 2026,” said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who celebrated two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he defended the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths on Saturday, moving from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material settings and drove out a larger lead of 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded, said Friedrich, who also secured his 22nd victory in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth this time after coming in second previously.
Christoph Hafer from the BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
If I knew what he did differently, I would do it too, said Lochner.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third seasonal victory in the women's two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After finishing in fourth place in the Monobob the day before, she raced to victory in the World Cup on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to qualifying for the Olympics, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasised: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely error-free runs, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I did not receive it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now he said he was expired, which made me very angry.
Take a look at the chat about the Asare Bank.
I want to return it and then order it again because it's on sale right now :)
Why is the delivery only starting on 16 March?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time
No, not until I click on it is there an extra field with the message
It was taken away yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And not to cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear wonderful girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things that I simply want to write down, and maybe it's the same for others...
I'm 24, I have kPTBS, I'm a full-time student and a dog mum - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to nursery, he's basically 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to a burn).
On top of that, he has a cold and we see each other less often (once or twice a week), which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy just had an upset stomach, I cooked for him and now he's in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have housework to do, which we naturally divide between us.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD is just about in remission at the moment, I'm reasonably well-treated and coping.
Not good, but I manage and am almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot from me (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and on Thursday I have an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room in my head.
So my week goes: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need those mental cues because otherwise I can't do it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm endlessly grateful that I don't have to work.
I'm really infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived otherwise.
I think this also has a lot to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today unfortunately the whole other colour plus surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The first delivery was exactly the same colour as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we now swap the table, will I get a different colour or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In any case, twice.
It was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed at school that many religion teachers did not believe in God and that it was just another subject for them, like maths or geography.
For me, this has always been a bit strange, perhaps also because I was brought up as a Christian and have always somehow believed.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also talk about work or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to separate them.
There is also a curriculum and so on.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe in it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
I hope my question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not?I'm happy to write in English, which I understand well
That's been going on for a very long time, so I would advise against it
That's good, thank you.
I expect a prompt response, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help, please
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for teenagers.
The film has two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernity (the real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the land of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers in Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, their paths cross and a plot is born.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can live.
I think the transition is also the grave of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that means anything to you, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has slept on her tummy since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child can take much more than you think.
Ensure that everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, go in and have a look from time to time, but no constant surveillance.
That drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child sleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it raise itself up from its belly?
Or is it lying face down directly on the mattress?
You can deduce from this whether everything is in order.
We are also all grown up and when my husband was born, it was normal to put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already "regular customers" of yours and have bought many articles
But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not yet received a reply.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently unusable.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
But it is simply the case that the politics of this broadcaster have become a complete mess.
Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said to be an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: "We don't want to be a permanent billboard."
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising channel that is trying to get its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
These, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and is trying to make hay out of the explosion of the rented rooms at the expense of the action.
How are you supposed to like all this?
Great if you like it, I find it horrible.
I request a call back as my delivered wooden table is defective.
Body break due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comfort for stomach ache or just for cuddling - my little heat friend is versatile.
Cherry stone pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits are very good at absorbing and dosing heat.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not feeling well.
The cherry stone pillow with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before warming the pillow, check for any untypical smells, stains or burn marks and, if present, dispose of immediately.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before heating!
In the microwave at max. 300 Watt for max. 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, evenly distribute the heat by shaking the pillow!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first heating, there may be a slight condensation on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy output can lead to damage (fire and burn hazard!).
Check before warming a pillow in the microwave that heating cereal products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the warmed inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion at your elbow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C)!
Do not use the pillow in cases of acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory complaints, fresh bruises, hematomas and swellings, and open wounds, as well as in persons with reduced pain sensitivity.
In case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels have escaped, dispose of the product and loose kernels immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to exclude overheating!
All serious adverse events associated with the product should be reported to the manufacturer and the regulatory authority of the country in which the user is located.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after the first half of the season in second place - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of a return to the football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar.
Things are also not going well for Ingolstadt under their third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) would no longer be charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that the power supply alone was enough for operation.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts, even with the power supply plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but nothing happened.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop while it's plugged in?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the #PRS_ORG# delivered to my room.
How can I book?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But does not know how high the seat is ...
Often on tour and yet with a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
Its 20-liter capacity swallows larger photo gear with ease, which can be securely stowed using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need in terms of everyday items remains well organised and separable from the photographic equipment thanks to the practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The stylish, minimalist design has it in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and at the same time allow access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: either conventionally through the lid, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellent solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags.
The closure flap has a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The zipper and hook are also magnetic.
This means that the rucksack can also be reliably closed without the hook wearing out.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: in addition to the flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the backpack enorm: If you take not only your photographic equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you.
The Everyday Backpack allows you to customise the interior (more on that below) so you can easily separate the two compartments and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side of the body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if it's going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I have been waiting in vain for an email from their support.
#NAME# emailed me yesterday to confirm the appointment of
Contact from the shipping company to collect the wrongly delivered table announced.
So far, I haven't received any news.
I ask for immediate settlement.

Many, many thanks for the help

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Call me
If you extend the voucher, then I will place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that last year turned out differently than expected, I couldn't have known, and I couldn't clear it up in time.
But as a customer, I do not accept this damage.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver who values reliability and safety when braking under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are cast and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which focuses on the balancing of the disc according to the properties of the original mounting.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the slots improve the cleaning of brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned discs emphasize the character of each car through an attractive and eye-catching appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly, triggering the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and prosperous towns in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it meant "Coloma or Bust!"
In this game, you're a pioneer heading west to seek your fortune and make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer peers to avoid going bust with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (known as "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or bend the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your own individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a period of three years, from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year California became a state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a ban!
This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Players then take turns performing actions, such as acquiring resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gunslingers.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the Anpreiser spins to a new location, changing the available actions.
This continues until the Anpreiser has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which players have to defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players contribute enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they receive rewards.
But if they fail, they get smaller rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I use the shipping method Warensendung (games folded) up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.

Why Children Are Not Tyrants Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW mental abuse, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it straight away.
>Children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Kids Are Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate about upbringing.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care, the film is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other caregivers must never, never, never use power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Länder to discuss abolition of testing requirement for triple vaccinated
The health ministers of the states want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated people.
“We need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing requirement can be lifted for those who have been vaccinated three times,” said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the health ministers’ conference, to Bild am Sonntag.
The abolition of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed "that he will make a proposal to the health ministers' conference on the following Tuesday". − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
How should I go about this?
Hi, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Ups, an error has occurred.
Shopping over the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer works.
I have updated my bank details.
Why?
What you describe is called *awareness*, which is sensory perception under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Hearing sounds/voices is the most common hallucination, followed by seeing images, and the least common is feeling pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with a higher rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep anaesthetic to protect the child until weaning.
Prior episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the pre-anesthetic interview.
Certain anesthesia techniques, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), carry a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment of mine describes awareness correctly, however, **u/Nitemarex** had per definition none.
I misread her comment.
But the chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros won't help.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the broken chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation and is standard in e-commerce.
Please check if they at least take back the broken chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
As a result, we lose a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email, which you have not answered.
The question again.
In the order and on the invoice, it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I must cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
will I not be called?
I had a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97
He has distinguished himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theatre history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is a new book on the table, fresh off the press: "An old man gets older".
The shattering diary of a slow goodbye to the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I hereby testify my gratitude for life".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is the Euro pallet, a standardised wooden pallet mainly used as a load carrier in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported to Austria each year is not recorded

In the Eastern Conference final, New York beat Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Tips & Tricks for Rouladen
I got many great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
It was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I've got the hang of it and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will make a beef stock.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What happens now?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I manage
IE is seeking a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18 January that the refund had been made.
But to this day, the money has not arrived.
Please check that.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
You haven't bought any poultry yet?
Time is running out.
We reveal where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube preamp stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of a guitar amp's sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
The VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME knobs allow you to set both the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amps feature a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to lower the volume without affecting the "gain" or distortion.
Further up, it sounded as if the POWER LEVEL regulator can even unleash a reserve of power if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
The AUX input can be used to connect a CD or MP3 player so you can jam along to your favourite songs.
A tuner is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
Anyone who also buys a VFS5 footswitch can conveniently call up the sounds with their feet, turn the effect blocks on and off, and set the tempo of the effect blocks that are compatible with this.
This is actually essential for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I've seen that with others.
Can you then send the lamp back?
Because it's too low over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If not, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Paying more than 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the wait has not been worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal talks
According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
“Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues on the agenda,” said Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri to the news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", because at the beginning there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revival of the agreement continued after a break of just under a week.
Iranian, German, British, Chinese, French and Russian negotiators are taking part in the talks.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State is now the federal state with the highest Corona infection rate
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest infection rate nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was above the mark of 1000 on Sunday in terms of the Corona infection rate.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has had the highest infection rate nationwide for some time, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the infection rate in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above 1,000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths associated with an infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 Covid-19 patients were treated in intensive care units.
There may be delays at weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with recording new cases.
I understand that.
As the delivery is scheduled for early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and take it to the post office, that's it?
I don't have to do anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to pay for the return.
An 8 euro return fee is, in my opinion, a cheek.
It's time for change
##MBundestag greetings to you, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why is the post office here?
If you look at the activity in the Bundestag over the past few months, you can see that it is not extinct.
We have gone into hibernation and have extended the summer lull for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the problem?
For the most part, this is simply down to the dissatisfaction with how some things have gone and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here still have a genuine interest in the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, it is up to the community around the MBundestag to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and found, simply put, a mess.
After some to-ing and fro-ing, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to call on everyone to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the Bundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves in the future?
* How will new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a few things, but it's not a big deal, we have Discord at the end of the day.
If you have the time and inclination, come to the Discord, work with us and let's decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lamp shade from you, which is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for me and not to my taste.
I have already ordered another hanging from you for this purpose.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope it comes back and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: does the bedspread #PRS_ORG# also come in larger sizes, for example 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cupboard will be collected promptly.
And I urge you to do that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the wardrobe as far as possible for collection - they must clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this will work.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to arrange a collection.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long would I have time to get them, or to decide to return them?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself lived a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism had been a planned stepping stone, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that is that I used to think that as a vegetarian I was supporting animal welfare, but eventually reflected and understood that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
So my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that there was resentment on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that vegetarians reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was "too blunt"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly pushed into a corner and conflicts arise without you wanting to.
A harmonium-loving vegan (;
This is not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not at the assigned location on the date that #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
As I cannot be there in person for a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed either.
Please assign me an alternative collection date.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be available again.
Lahnsteiner fortified for water rescue: 45,000 euro grant from the state
Recently, the Minister of the Interior of Rhineland-Palatinate, Roger Lewentz, handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the Freiwillige Feuerwehr Lahnstein to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte in the Lahnsteiner Rathaus.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The device wagon is used by the diving squad Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are permanently expecting an increase in calls: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the further increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, but syncing, deleting and reloading the app did NOT work.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Okay then.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for standing up for the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, i.e. we were also armed officers in the executive, I don't want to go into this any further!
For me, the question of right and left is always very simplified.
In principle, one should say that the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it should also be clear to everyone that special uniforms and weapon carriers also attract people to the right of the conservatives. It should also be clear to everyone that these people then find it difficult to cope with the lived reality. It should also be clear that, in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I mean here not the exaggeratedly feminine stereotypical gay, because there are few to none of these in the executive, but normal men and women who do not tell you that they are gay, and on these people I can and must rely, because in the end they can save your life or put it on the line for you.
But even these fringe groups represent, in my experience, a conservative stance, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less understood by over-the-top left-wing politics, even though this politics claims to be fighting for them and to be on their side, but they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, of course, the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, so you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but that they are allowed to openly express their views there or even openly hatch state-threatening plans in the media is completely exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it does happen that policemen and soldiers, who have often been deployed abroad, begin to generalise and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing sympathisers meet up and engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, something like this is fought against in my opinion, and also with political education and enlightenment against the whole thing!
Germany is so interconnected internationally, and I think that's a good thing. We can't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black be delivered to Germany or is this basket also available in Germany?
I always only find you as a partner company.
but at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves filled with something yellow
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
Organised by a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been bothered by something for a while.
I'm very disciplined and organised at work (self-employed, very little free time), but I've always struggled to keep my house permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases when everything comes to a standstill, and every now and then it gets me and I tidy up and clean.
But it's never really "that someone might drop by spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) not any better, it bothers me somewhere but usually the household just loses against work and laziness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organised with your child?
We haven't yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because for me, I have no motivation to do it, it just doesn't bother me so much as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have more motivation with children or are you lazy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality, as well as anatomically pre-formed cut, offers maximum comfort, perfect fit, and allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-formed with special, extended articulation at the joints for improved mobility (at the elbows and knees)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, arms and knees)
High-quality pre-shapes in the lower back area and in the groin area ensure a close-fitting, perfect fit.
The Elaskin 8.8 Stretch Panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the zipper and improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and fitting equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility for arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Worn on the chest, it brings heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) face seal at the hood increases comfort, seal and durability (separate hood)
Soft, collar-located zone improves sealing with a fine-tunable fit adjustment through a flexible, gentle Velcro closure that does not adhere to the casing or seams
Double-sealed zippers at the elbows and ankles connect a fold-over inner cuff to a soft, neoprene outer cuff
45° indentation at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and strength when putting on.
Long zipper on the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a hood
Long G-Lock P zipper (overall without hood) with metal sliders and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Zip fastenings on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent ripping if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels bonded flush with outer and inner overlap
Edges of the outer flaps reinforced for greater strength
Seams of the inner cuffs reinforced for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
Career in social work - as someone with a self-doubting personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in software development and have been qualified for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I am increasingly realising that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for some time about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-doubting (avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
This means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I don't have a problem with talking to people on a rational level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I've been told that I come across as unapproachable (which I think has improved).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in areas such as addiction counselling or family support.
However, I don't know if the actual working day is really like how I imagine it, and it is difficult to find anything about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it drags me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I've messed up the simplest things again") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding him back from his work with my stupid questions"/"He must think I'm really stupid" etc.).
I will probably have problems in every job but I wanted to mention it.
But did you get your sofa back?
There was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for a pick-up appointment
What do they mean by 'please return'?
When I download a book from the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# authorises this book
Are there any problems there?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein (protein) taken in with the food is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and built up again from these into its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the formation of new feathers in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high burden for the animal's total organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during the breeding season, as otherwise it may disrupt the breeding process.
After this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is advisable only to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A scooped measuring spoon (inset) equals 1 g NEKTON Bio.
In the case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the regrowth of feathers is visible.
After that, the normal dose is served until the feather regeneration is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, away from direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Sorry, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order was damaged and pictures were attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement by a member of the community contradicts the bylaws
Hey r/Legaladvice,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So, an application was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the by-laws.
However, in the statutes, the walnut tree is explicitly listed as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We get that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, I still have a sofo without using it.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
yes, I believe that, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
According to the current police press release (14:03), a car was involved in a head-on collision while overtaking.
There are injured.
Okay, understood.
Well, thanks again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further career
Happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is only moderately good because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought about.
Before I go into detail here ... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who know my situation - that is, from you.
I am currently doing the ref as a newcomer.
I originally studied something else and worked in an area there (to at least remain somewhat anonymous, I will not name anything more specific here).
However, the whole thing was then too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that would be more fun.
At some point I ended up in the teaching profession and was sure that this was it - even though the framework conditions are much less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now at the third "I google other job postings" moment.
And it's only been half a year.
In the fights before, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after which I can still turn around.
But I'm absolutely finished right now.
I have had so little free time in the last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress resistant, but that was my weekend, my weekend and my tea time my tea time.
I was free.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments.
Now even a family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
In principle, it's fun and, from the outside, the referee is doing well, in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already.
I ask myself whether I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions - or whether I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was valued, where I could take free time when I needed it, where the work was somehow boring, but I was adequately paid for it and where I worked as a team and not as a lone fighter, as is the case most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back in the same place a year from now and unhappy.
You can tell I'm all over the place, but maybe as an outsider you have some advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation I'm in, which I'm completely done with and basically start crying at the smallest thought of it.
I'm not going to make any emotional decisions now, that's probably not going to lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which will do for now.
Thanks for reading and apologies for the whiny tone.
I hope my situation is at least a little bit clearer now.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has steadily evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amps deliver an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analogue circuits because they simply do a better job of reproducing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amps feature a sealed chassis and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just pour out.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which led to another performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics, as well as many more and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the output stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The 12AX7 tube-based Valve Reactor circuitry in every VT+ amplifier perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances and sonic character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro straps, it adapts to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and an on-camera flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still have room for more lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for photofree things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also a good choice for drone pilots, as it offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro with remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows have caused great damage on the Canary Island.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past few days, but volcanologists still dare not predict when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Offshore, two new land spits were created by cooled lava, with a total area of about 50 hectares.
In particular, the banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants depend directly or indirectly, was severely affected.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper El País.
Christmas and presents
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colourful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still holds our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "peace-making social contract of primitive peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Saint Nicholas became Father Christmas
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who associated Christmas with gift-giving.
Prior to this, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in various ways.
The background to this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw gold through the windows of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving gifts led to the popular German tradition of filling children's shoes with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they reject the idea of a mediator between God and man as "saint worship."
For these reasons, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther made Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition.
As a result, the focus shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see these details as so important, it only bothers a few people that the tradition of St. Nicholas is similar to that of St. Martin's Day, with Martin's singing and Martin's procession still being an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today, you can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches under the Christmas tree in boots by the door.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources show a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a happy muddle over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas man, who is essentially a kind of Nikolaus, with whom over time certain characteristics have been assigned.
These include, for example, his white moustache, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sledge, pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is Befana, the witch, who is said to have led them to the Christ Child.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost has gained some fame.
Here it is not reindeer but three horses that pull his sledge.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the presents.
I have been getting this error for 3 weeks now when trying to download a new book, my account details and contact details are up to date:
Please help to fix the error, as I
otherwise buy a different e-book #PRS_ORG#.
I have requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near royal palace
A man armed with a knife has been shot by police near Kensington Palace in London.
Police said callers reported a man with a weapon going into a bank and a betting shop.
The man fled in a vehicle, which was later stopped by officers, authorities said.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was already declared dead at the scene of the crime.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with two earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Light duration max. 10 hrs.
– The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow from within in colour.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: it is the sun that causes this solar light to fascinatingly shine - either in white or coloured light (in six different colour tones).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the neighbourhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can hold his own thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of work: "Smart Stone" does not require a power supply or batteries as a solar light.
Place the "Luminous Stone" in any sunlit place.
Two supplied earth pegs can be used to provide additional stability if required.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, along with his battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As dusk falls, "Smart Stone" begins to glow automatically; in what colour, that's up to you: Six attractive light colours are available - in addition to daylight white.
The power is also switched off automatically when the battery is charged to a predetermined minimum or when it gets light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts over the next day.
I have done this several times and it does not work.
Too bad, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will not order on principle.

Pill problem
Hello ladies,
I hope I'm doing this right, this is actually my first post after a year on reddit.
To my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such horrible period pains and shitty PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it as it is, because I already have to take enough medication for chronic illnesses, which I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gone from 0 to 100 pimples explosively during my last approximately two-year break and they were everywhere.
So far, so superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of the break, things have never really normalised.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already free of perfume and nonsense, but perhaps someone can recommend something to me.
Unfortunately, the gynaecologist did not take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still to come.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the skin is such a thing.
Vorbupertär had severe neurodermatitis, then a period of calm, then widespread psoriasis and the acne issue.
I have also tried all sorts of things in terms of nutrition as part of my Christian illness, and I have ended up sticking with a diet that is low in sugar, milk and meat, because nothing else has worked so well.
It could also be that hormonally I'm just a mess, but if you're like me and you're a mess everywhere, you don't want to go looking for what else might be wrong.
I already had everything their colleague semina o. ä.
Written and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what the response was to my issue.
In between I have to work and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but is it generally available in large sizes
since it is available in large sizes in black

In the name of the people: Lay judges pass judgement
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
But a lot depends on their verdict, even though they don't wear robes: jurors decide whether and for how long someone goes to prison.
Two of them talk to the "Oeffentlichen" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John F. Kennedy Street.

A new 110-kV underground cable will be built in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The roughly seven-kilometre-long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead line near the settlement of Edermanning in Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived with us in part.
The blue Betsell number: #PRS_ORG# with the tracking number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what happens next?
Have a nice start to the week!
Forget it, I've already explained that several times yesterday!
This is a glass commode and all the sides are broken, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken
The chest of drawers is in my flat and #PRS_ORG# are refusing to come into the flat because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be collected because no one is allowed into my flat
Thanks for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, which is why I asked #PRS_ORG#, as it is probably a general problem
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello, dear colleagues,
I've been at the Ref since the summer, and I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently having a lot of trouble being time-efficient in planning my geography lessons.
Unfortunately, my school is not very well equipped technically, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
At the moment, I simply need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour is different.
In principle, the methods are always the same, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (which I also need for UBs etc.).
I usually start planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (I usually create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied.
This is why there are also worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really like that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to settle the return as quickly as possible.
The trade fears the Christmas business due to the 2G regulation.
Only people who have been vaccinated or have recovered can enter most shops.
The trade sees this as unnecessary and complains about sales losses.
He also has a possible solution.
In the view of the German Retail Federation (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for the retail trade.
Stefan Genth, the HDE's managing director, criticised declines in turnover in businesses selling non-daily necessities.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies are looking negatively at the rest of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
What should have been the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless hole, said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis turnover in the past week.
Things are going well only in the food retail sector and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
“2G for shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic,” he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel.
He demanded that the wristband system be allowed nationwide.
After that, every customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the band they received that day.
In addition, spot checks in retail outlets - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - should be sufficient.
Even the property company Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-corona level without 2G, and sales at around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to Wirtschaftswoche.
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, whereby "visitors, for example, can present their 2G proof once at a central location in the centre and then, equipped with an armband similar to that in a club hotel, enter all the shops unimpeded". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and the frame also has a flaw, which has been covered up with yellow filler.
It looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repacked it and sealed it up again.
What should I do now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
The colour temperature and brightness of the lamp are set by a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities.
Besides the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree beam angle is excellent for illuminating large areas from a relatively short distance.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to use both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, simply hold down one of the storage buttons for a longer period of time.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, thanks to the possibility of using cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can make use of existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check the batteries before use to see if they have enough power - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments, a value in the two display screens (the left battery in the upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the projector is very simple.
It has a 16mm tube for mounting, so you can attach it directly to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using adjusters on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality, and are therefore designed for long life and hard use.
In addition, a swivel joint is included.
It is also great that a bag is included.
This way, you can transport or store the light with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Shame, I was given that one and it's too small :(
“Party we wanted to throw”: Frankfurt celebrates after a torrent comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessen, who had lost twice in a row, were apparently on the way to their next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the Eintracht turned things around, shot the frustration of a patchy start to the season out of their system within an hour, and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner said on DAZN and gave a "blanket praise to everyone who was involved."
It looked like another setback for the now ninth-ranked Frankfurters, who are still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen 2-0 ahead.
What then happened also impressed the SGE coach.
How the players then came back and put in a fantastic performance, said Glasner.
I am crazy happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth game and overcame his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
“I believe our mentality is incredible,” said the 27-year-old and was particularly pleased with the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but sees himself well positioned in terms of personnel.
It is extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in top condition.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live a very professional life.
Now they want to "move forward step by step and remain modest" and complete the tasks by the end of the year "at this level".
Next, on Wednesday as part of the English week, there is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky).
I just received an email that my package is being returned to you because of an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect it, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money has been refunded and place the order again?
This would unfortunately mean that I would not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat in the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampener for women's handball team before quarter-final against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's women's handball team left the floor with hanging heads and empty looks.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection suffered a crushing defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face the host nation Spain in the quarter-finals.
“We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent,” said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game from all of us that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, there must be a clear improvement against the 2019 World Championship runner-up on the next Tuesday to keep the slim dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels, a backcourt player, with six goals.
“We simply weren’t there – neither in the attack, nor in the defence,” admitted Xenia Smits, a backcourt player, and demanded: “We have to look forward now.”
Not up to scratch from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team did not start well.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal for the DHB team came after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a quick counterattack.
However, this was not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive defence of the Danish women, the German women could hardly get into the limelight - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
As a result, the game was over by the 20th minute, with a score of 3:10, as backcourt player Mia Zschocke received a red card for a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she is allowed to participate in the quarterfinals.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection got into the game a little better and at least came within five goals of the break.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is one of the medal contenders at the finals.
As a result, the German team was unable to muster a performance improvement and left the floor as clear losers.

The title implies that I am a travelling vaccinator, working in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in care homes.
As these will soon be completed to a large extent, it will then go on to vaccination centres for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit to the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, so long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, is it compatible with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility falls the task of informing people about the vaccination, the indication (a person has a right to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination ordinance and no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have nurses, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of vaccines, who are not allowed to administer vaccinations (can they?), so that I carry out most of the vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the answer
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by someone from Amberg, has caused heated debate in the BR television programme "Wir in Bayern".
However, unlike on many previous days, the term was not guessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "nervous man."
And no one who "has to do everything quickly".
That, the people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Where the man from Amberg announced the solution, which probably also surprised many people in the Upper Palatinate.
“The Huidlerer”, the audience learned, “is a cloth used to wipe out the oven”.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
Closing a gap in education - probably also for many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't bought a book in two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected to the PC, synced and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tyre choice for racing bikes - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to train at least a little bit for my bicycle tour next week.
I said it, I did it, and I set off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then it happened, what lurks in every city (this time: thanks Krefeld!).
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tyre definitely did not want to take part in the rest of the journey.
As it was a weekday, I didn't really have the opportunity to get a replacement jacket and a replacement tube, so I had to turn around and take the first train home.
It was also not quite as bad in terms of mood, perhaps it is better if I practice changing the tyre again before the bike ride.
However, I am now faced with a question and I hope you can help me.
As I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would rather not have this problem.
Now, it really wasn't that bad, as the old tyres from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had ridden 120km by 4pm on the day I collected the bike!) were also suboptimal, as he had used them for several years on rollers.
But if I think about the fact that I have to change a tyre after 80-90km of driving, then I'm probably in a bad mood :D
I then got into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; these are supposed to be unpuncturable.
Now it all sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I have little desire now to spend 40€/tyre, only to be disappointed in the end.
Furthermore, I wonder: I think I currently have 25x622 on the road bike.
There are also (apparently?) Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me to use other tyres for a racing bike in general?
The Schwalbe site seems to recommend the Durano DD to my absolute! layman's knowledge?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!
Car crashes into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old crashed his car into a central island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for unknown reasons, and then drove onto the oncoming lane, the police reported.
This resulted in a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.

After the release of our new high-end broadband speaker B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series also had offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and looks like the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this blueprint comes with a suitably designed foot included to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
Principally, the SOLO 15 is very well suited to people for whom the maximum volume plays a relatively minor role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound quality.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of generating such high sound pressure levels without filtering.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she is impressively mature and for her size very impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble boost.
This is common with wideband antennas in general to optimize the increasingly high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound, exactly aimed at the listening position.
By slightly rotating the tweeter outwards, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localisation of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM result in a dynamic that has no equal.
The SOLO 15 complements our SOLO series and expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning, so that corresponding changes can be planned during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the case, the speaker cutout must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the bottom plate at the corresponding place, so that you can easily run the cable through there later.
With the help of a router, the speaker opening in the front is followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be flush fitted later.
The back of this opening should be fitted with a 45° chamfer to maximize the opening area of the speaker chassis inside.
The four soldering points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Fase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
Now the back, the lid, the front and the bottom are glued on.
The three stiffeners should also be installed and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in thickness as needed, so long as one is willing to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, the two sides and the front.
With the help of a suitable hole saw or a Forstner drill, the mounting of the openings of the bass reflex pipe, as well as the connection clamp on the back, is facilitated.
Then, a roundover bit is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off.
After that, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the case and additionally secured with long wooden screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5mm drill bit) the screw holes for the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the case has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming/blowing), the cable laying begins.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back.
To do this, the entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and allowed to stick out about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there.
Next, the frequency converter is prepared and used.
The circuit diagram of the frequency changer, as well as the corresponding wiring diagram can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions Weiche Solo 15.
Once the frequency switch has been installed and the connection terminal screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a bit of skill, you can pour hot glue onto the opening and thus close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Now comes the damping, according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and secured with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of the damping material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hi all,
Finally, we can announce that we will be holding the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the switch, so we will be streaming the Oscars 2021 with at least seven beans and hopefully thousands of you.
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - but we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Chill some drinks, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
