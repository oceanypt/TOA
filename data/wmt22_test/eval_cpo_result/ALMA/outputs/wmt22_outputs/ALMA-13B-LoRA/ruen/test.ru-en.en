In my opinion, the literature curriculum was formed by ladies of a certain age based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilovsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of a certain age.
And the psychology and torments of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting to teenagers.
In general, teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of the characters.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were stuffed to represent a particular variety?
There are roses of such a color and with such a structure of the petals, reminiscent of velvet, usually of dark red and burgundy tones.
And the light roses look different, the petals have an atlas or silky shine.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
The "Micropack Prestige" model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different firmness sides: the medium-firm side is made of latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, and the medium-soft side is made of a natural latex plate.
The 1000 springs per square metre spring block quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the wave or hammock effect.
Among the model's advantages are breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, naturally ventilates as well as coconut coir.
As a result, a healthy microclimate is maintained in the sleeping area.
The mattress also comes with an extended warranty.
The official manufacturer’s warranty is 5 years, but in practice the mattress lasts longer.
Dust and dirt protection is provided by a detachable jacquard cover that is included.
Buy an orthopaedic pillow to go with the mattress – it is recommended to support the spine in its optimal position during sleep.
The fill determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

It's better not to have any than these...
Either find an outside driver, or someone who is willing to invest and work with you on a partnership basis.
If not, then sell the car, even at a loss, don’t hesitate.

Andrey, you have been clearly explained that pensioners work in schools, they will not work in the command line.
The computer teacher can't help either, he wasn't taught this, the schoolkids play games on Windows.
So there is no support.
I shudder to remember those feasts and the guests at my parents' house.
Guests are at the door, but the meat is still being fried on the stove, and the mother is still scrubbing the floor.
Lord, I was already exhausted when I sat down at the table.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you drag the groceries, two days of cooking, and a day of cleaning after.
And what about the guests?
They are doing well, and they always have a cake with them.
Since then, I have not liked holidays or guests.
Even for my family, I set the table minimally.
As for the treats, I prepare them for them, and I bake very often, just like that.
Germany: Fourth Covid jab inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in summer or autumn 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with new strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are probably not enough for full protection.
Ulrich Weigelt, head of the Association of General Practitioners, is convinced of this.
Die Welt reported this on Saturday, 11 December.
“We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn,” the expert believes.
In addition, Waigel hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus will be possible "in combination with vaccination against the flu".
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, booster vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omicron".
And the new variant is particularly dangerous.
In particular, the likelihood of reinfection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is indicated by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, the BioNTech / Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an adapted vaccine by March 2022.
The companies stressed that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new "Omicron" coronavirus variant.
BioNTech and Pfizer's study showed that with two doses of the vaccine, efficacy is significantly lower: "neutralizing potential is reduced more than 25-fold."
“This suggests that two doses of BNT162b2 may not provide adequate protection against the Omicron variant,” BioNTech and Pfizer said.
So a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of shortening the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta and omicron variants of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience is very convincing in this regard,” the expert stressed.
Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was designed with ice fishing in mind, not just casting.
These wobblers have a greater specific weight than their close-sized analogs, which, without a doubt, positively affects the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top lip made of strong and elastic plastic, which creates additional vibrations during vertical and horizontal movements.
As a "winter wobble" when fished vertically, the Bet-A-Vib displays a fairly aggressive action.
Often the most effective is simple, monotonous animation, that is, moving the rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very great, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, which is cluttered with underwater vegetation, rocks and other obstacles, for which there may be a snag.
Furthermore, a small deviation is relevant when fishing for pike and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a precise and aggressive presentation of the bait is required.
Reaching the apex of its trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly pivots and returns to its starting vertical.
No less successfully, Bet-A-Vib is used for winter fishing for pond trout.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a sound capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without one (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib can irritate a passive pike that does not react even to live bait.
When casting Bet-A-Vib demonstrates distance and accuracy.
This wobbler is easy to understand and not fussy, and it works well with lines and braided lines of large diameters.
For casting and retrieving pike, perch, roach, or pike, in addition to the uniform retrieve, the "step" and "tapping" on the bottom are also effective.
If you are fishing in snaggy areas, you can change the front treble hook to a single, which will reduce the chances of snags.
Bet-A-Vib is one of the most consistent performers in its class and, as a result, one of the most effective.
It can be used with equal success in relatively shallow and fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young layabouts are sitting on the necks of elderly parents.
‘Golden youth’ are obviously lazy people in the majority, who know nothing and can do nothing.

Libya reported 7,000 Russian mercenaries
More than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) “Wagner” are in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the head of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
‘There are currently more than 7,000 mercenaries from the Wagner private military company in Libya.
They also have planes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets at the Ghardabiya air base (which is also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu quoted him as saying.
Khalid al-Mishri also noted that Russian mercenaries "are trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "putting their man in power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain a presence
According to the publication's source, Moscow was looking for a country to preserve its presence in North Africa and "settled on Libya".
“Wagner” has been in Libya since 2019, uses the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufra, the agency notes.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries
According to the agency, "Wagner" is allegedly operating in nine African countries - the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders and security for energy installations.
In exchange for these services, the Wagner Group’s subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use mineral resources and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technology, and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, the “Wagnerites” allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not listed in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not listed in the personnel rosters.
This company is under US sanctions.
As a reminder, earlier the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved sanctions against Wagner.
This decision is expected to be approved by the European Council on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The High Council of Libya de facto is the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions, dominated by Islamists, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single day of voting in parliamentary and presidential elections from 24 December at least until February 2022.
“With less than two weeks to go until the election, the chances of it being held on time are rapidly diminishing,” the article says.
Meanwhile, Libya's High National Election Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Russian perceptions of foreign policy
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country’s foreign policy, while 29% believe that failures predominate.
‘Examples of successes – ‘we protected and restored peace in Syria’, ‘resolution on Nord Stream 2’, ‘we scared the whole world that we have powerful weapons’, ‘we took back Crimea’.
The main failures are ‘conflict with Ukraine’, ‘confrontation with Western countries’, and ‘isolation from the world’, according to the Foundation for Public Opinion.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paperwork - all government services are now digital only
Dubai's government has announced a complete move away from paper-based processes and towards digital technologies.
All state services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitalisation of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, on Saturday.
Now, the internal and external document flow in all government agencies in Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, the police, municipal bodies, courts, and so on. Many commercial structures also joined the government’s initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document flow began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million sheets of paper have been saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labour and 353.8 million dollars in monetary terms.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens two days a year.
Dana, well, the dates of birth and how old the child is, this is already madness, and the class and group in the kindergarten too.
I don't believe that people like that exist.
And if there are, they obviously don't care about anything, including their family.
My mother, her two brothers and my grandfather and grandmother lived on 3 Vladimirskaya Street, on the ground floor without bars.
At first, they knocked on the door, then on the window, then decided not to be polite, broke the window and climbed in, but Grandpa had a baseball bat, which they received.
These people definitely knew that someone was home...
Turkey's auto production, exports fall below 2020 level
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November as the lira slumped.
As a result, the industry’s results for 11 months were worse than last year’s, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were released from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year ago.
Around 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year.
And if, by the end of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed positive dynamics compared to last year, then, by the end of the 11th month of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The reason for such a fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a fall in economic activity across all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received credit payment deferrals in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports a correspondent for Kazinform news agency.
“According to information from the Agency for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year, in accordance with the instructions of the Head of State of 1 April 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 of 9 April 2021 “On the Approval of the Procedure for the Provision of Payment Deferrals for Subjects of Small and Medium-Sized Businesses”, wrote Alikhan Smailov in his reply to the deputy’s request.
He reminded that the procedure for granting deferrals on loans provided for banks and microfinance organisations to provide deferrals on loans issued to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The deferral period was from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the small business subject.
The borrower’s statement may have indicated a different deferral period.
During the deferral period, the creditor suspended the debt collection process, notified the debtor of the need to repay the overdue debt, and ceased to charge the debtor commissions and other payments," the deputy prime minister noted.
In 2021, 603 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) submitted applications for deferment of loan payments to second-tier banks, of which 553 SMEs received deferment on a total of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have filed applications for deferment with MFOs, of which deferment has been granted to 95 SMEs in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," A. Smaikov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with a weak immune system can easily tolerate the "omikron" strain
The doctor suggested that people with weak immune systems may be able to carry it more easily than those with a strong immune response
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the "okmicron" strain of coronavirus could be dangerous.
The reason lies in the conditions in which the virus originated.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of a person infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
In other words, the mutation did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response from the immune system, it became very fast.
Apparently, he has more of these spike proteins, spikes, than he should, and his antibodies did not cut them off during mutations, comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weak immune systems may be able to tolerate "okmiron" better than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong immune response to anything, to any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is how it is with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-old young people die and 60-year-old old people cough it off.
The immune response of the young is crazy, it is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten with a finger, he hits like a cannon at sparrows, concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the worst of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
In the first case, the treatment is very successful and quick, but in the second case, it is often only possible to treat the symptoms - all hope is on the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body – this is temperature, weakness, and feeling unwell.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, a scratchy throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left side, as well as abdominal pain, can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, the vaccination of the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old may begin by the end of the year.
Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at the MIPT, noted that this category of people are very susceptible to COVID-19.
For teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is maximized.
This is the most socially active layer, just as children in kindergartens are, said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at MIPT, to Moscow 24.
Huge thanks to the author of this article.
I was happy to refresh my memories...
Teath-In.
In those distant 1970s and 1980s, no dance floor was complete without the melodies of this group.
And at home, gathering with friends, they danced to their music.
Immunologists hypothesize why people with obesity become victims of COVID
The researchers studied fat tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
The immune cells in the fat tissue, macrophages, also became infected and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of Covid-19 patients who died and found the virus in fat surrounding different organs.
It is known that the HIV and flu viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably also capable of this.
Biologist explains the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin named the reasons for the appearance of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting even in a familiar environment.
Golosheikin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in abstract thinking.
“There is discussion that hearing loss can be an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease or a risk factor for its development,” the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Earlier, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education RNIMU named after N.I.
Anna Bogolepova, head of the Department of Cognitive Disorders at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned around 30,000 illegally removed from the country artefacts
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return about 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, by the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad, on the Al-Hayat TV channel.
Since 2011, Egypt has recovered 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 Egyptian artifacts were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gaouad clarified that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Now the department's employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "monitor auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that after returning, the cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
One of the returned artefacts, he said, was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium that is now part of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of the pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
The auction house Christie's held an auction on July 4, at which the bust, which is more than 3,000 years old, was sold for $5.97 million (around 680 million rubles).
This angered Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally removed from the Karnak temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
Tutankhamun's head, depicting him as the sun god Amun, has been in private hands since 1985 and has not been offered for sale.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively pursuing the repatriation of illegally removed antiquities from the country in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
“The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account” – and this is right, because the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are a separate nation (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see the census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, the Financial Times writes.
The thing is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, a bank can monitor information on corporate devices issued to its employees because they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, with many employees working remotely, the bank wants to extend the rule to all devices used for work purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the poet and his "ego".
He is already outside of any literary associations, he has spat out imaginism, he is himself, but he is known, in demand, sometimes harshly criticized by critics, even viciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their shoulders.
More than 60 poems were written in a year, many of them real masterpieces, the Persian motifs cycle was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, and the collection "Soviet Russia" was published.
And the greatest success came at the end of June 1925, when the State Publishing House signed a contract with Esenin to publish his works in three volumes.
No contemporary poet of Sergei Aleksandrovich's has been accorded such an honour, he is the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money – according to the contract, the honorarium was 1,000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles per month, while the engineer received 200).
Money was needed more than ever that year.
Yesenin married the great-granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofia Tolstoy, and he had to establish a family home, support his sisters Katy and Sasha, and his mother.
Life seemed to be getting back on track, there was plenty to be happy about, but for him everything was tinged with darkness, as if the nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after his death) had materialised:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Either the wind is whistling
Over the empty and deserted field,
Is it like a grove in September?
Alcohol scatters the brain.
Many of his acquaintances noted that Esenin was in very bad shape, looked very ill.
Repeated absences and nervous breakdowns are becoming more common.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis – alcoholism – was ever made for Sergei Aleksandrovich, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, relating to May 1923, when Esenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, was recovering his health in a clinic near Paris under the supervision of Professor Pyotr Gannushkin (two years later, Esenin will again end up with Gannushkin, this time in Moscow).
On the other hand, there are plenty of testimonies of the poet’s binges, scandals on this account, and visits to the police station – they are scattered across dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 20s, the poet's terrible romance with the green serpent developed rapidly.
At the end of summer 1923, Esenin briefly moved in with his friend, imaginist Ivan Starcev.
It is surprising, but Esenin, with his very good income, never had his own home in either Moscow or St. Petersburg. He was always found in rented apartments, hotels, or with friends.
Starev remembers:
He only came to stay overnight, and in most cases in an inebriated state.
Once, returning home at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the staircase...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
Coming to his senses, he started coughing uncontrollably, spraying blood all over the sheet..."
And even Esenin himself, after his trip to Europe and the United States (at that time, there was a dry law in the United States, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol with her) admitted:
“I didn’t see anything there other than pubs and streets…
I was already at the end and stopped remembering people...
Well, and he drank, of course...
I drank because I was lonely."

Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195 mattress
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern interpretation of the budget model in the premium line.
The base of the mattress is a Duet double spring block.
A smaller, softer spring is inserted inside the large spring.
This helps to evenly distribute the load on the mattress.
Both sides of the mattress are filled with artificial latex.
It is an analogue of natural latex, but it is more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material increases the comfort effect of the mattress.
The artificial latex is hypoallergenic and does not absorb moisture or dust.
The mattress is ideal for couples with a large weight difference (up to 30 kilograms).
Thanks to the "smart" springs, there is no wave effect here, when the light partner slides to the side of the heavy partner.
The pleasant, soft Sense Jacquard cover is quilted with a layer of synthetic batting.
Natural fabrics do not accumulate static electricity.
This model of mattress can be made in a rolled version (vacuum roll packaging).
Now my son is almost 16, and for a long time he has not been tormented by the desire to misbehave.
All the energy is focused on deciding what he will do for a living.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had periodic run-ins with the law up until our wedding day.
The father cares for his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love".
Why did the girl cry on the exam when she hadn't even failed it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't school?
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
He will retake.
Millions of students know this.
What are we talking about?
Poland's Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as "weapons" against the EU
Poland's Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as "weapons"
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland Paweł Jabłoński expressed the opinion that President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as "weapons" against the European Union and intends to return to such "operation" next year.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made this statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonskiy, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official is also convinced that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world".
As reported by kp.ru, earlier the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they announced their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

‘It’s not Semyon’s hat’: when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughing stock
At social events in 2021, velvet blazers dominated.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashionable solution was Daniel Craig.
In September, at the premiere of the film No Time to Die, he appeared in a velvet mauve jacket and a traditional Bond bow tie.
Following in his footsteps twice was Prince William, who first donned a green velvet blazer that didn't adhere to royal dress code for the Earthshot Prize awards ceremony, and then opted for a more classic look for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charity.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was adopted by Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to collect his seventh "Golden Ball" in a Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress has already noted growing demand for velvet men's suits in Russia.
According to data from the service’s analysts, received by Gazeta.ru, they were bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colours are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand roubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets – they choose a set of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are presented almost in all brands – Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, Saint Laurent.
The most coveted is the Gucci model in which the brand’s ambassador, Jared Leto, appeared at the premiere of the film The House of Gucci.
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made from silk.
A special weaving technique results in a dense fabric with a bristly outer texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget-friendly options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they last for less time.
Fashion expert for Lamoda, Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the most important thing is not its model or cut, but appropriateness.
“Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a formal event, - explains Vahoshkin. - It will also be suitable for those occasions when the invitation specifies a dress code of “Black Tie” or “Creative Black Tie”.
Another important criterion, compliance with which allows you to choose a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
“A man in a velvet jacket, first and foremost, needs to have the right advanced social circle with a decent income, - believe the authors of the Telegram channel about men’s fashion “Mr. Brummell”. - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to related social events, where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakoshkin suggests pairing a velvet blazer with similar formal items: classic trousers with braces, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from ‘Bramwell’s Beauties’ are sure: it would be inappropriate for a civil servant to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate party, but if we’re talking about ‘a leader from among those who run this event, then “yes”, he would be a good fit’.
If a lower-ranking employee is motivated by the desire to move up in the company's complex hierarchy or to get financial bonuses, it's best not to wear a velvet jacket.
The editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion are sure that the management will definitely appreciate this with the phrase "not by Sanya's cap".
Very mixed feelings about the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, so forced.
And has nothing to do with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But I wish you all the best in life!
It’s all about money – alternative energy is well lobbied, i.e. paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, electricity prices have gone up.
Traditional energy is also not a problem - and gas, oil, and coal were cheaper than they are now.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
Every little bit helps.
And who is in the middle?
As usual, an ordinary customer.
Does the sheriff care about Indian problems?
Therefore, we should not consider Western politicians as idiots who "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a decent salary.
I didn't see a single beautiful person in the pictures in the article.
Simply mediocre compared to the average passenger.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, then they won't sit next to them, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave conscious of his slavery and struggling against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who does not know that he is a slave and who lives in a silent, unconscious and mute slave life is simply a slave.
A slave who salivates when he self-righteously describes the joys of slavery and extols the virtues of a good and kind master is a slave, a slave."
An immunologist said that re-vaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the "omicron" strain of coronavirus
Revaccination after four to five months may protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron".
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kruchkov, who called a vaccination after six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
“Previously, this period was normal, but now it’s best to do the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic illnesses, after four,” the expert said, calling for parallel vaccination and revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
‘If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or he has recovered and been vaccinated, or he has been vaccinated and recovered, then he has ‘hybrid immunity’, that is, there are a lot of antibodies and there are enough neutralising ones’, the expert clarified.
G7 warns Russia of 'massive consequences' if it invades Ukraine
The G7 countries (Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that "Russia's military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be costly" for Moscow, but no specific measures are outlined in the document.
“We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia’s military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine,” the statement said.
The ministers then call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and abide by its international obligations on military transparency," as President Biden said in a video call with President Putin on December 7.
‘We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine’, the foreign ministers of the G7 also state.
The use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price to pay in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the right of any sovereign nation to determine its own future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation in our common and comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "a united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia".
The Pfizer vaccine was considered 32 times less effective against the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower than against other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong came to this conclusion, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was deemed less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant,” Professor Malik Peiris said.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against a severe course of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron variant could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increase mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the delivery of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel in blocking the acquisition of Kyiv of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany vetoed the purchase by Ukraine of counter-sniper systems and rifles for shooting down drones.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to pursue the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this refers to the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the new German government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, has yet to take a clear position on whether to allow arms shipments to Ukraine.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect arms deliveries from Berlin with Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of escalating the conflict in the Donbass, despite the "occupation of Russia" of part of Ukrainian territory.
Germany will retain the same “illogical” position under the new chancellor, the diplomat is sure.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kyiv was expecting help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine hopes that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that earlier this year, the co-chair of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated for the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.
Sergey NOSOV 2, no, poor eyesight has nothing to do with it.

No, you are an illiterate person.

Recently, the zombie box said that the production of cars is experiencing an unprecedented shortage of semiconductors.
A table appeared on the screen showing which country produces what percentage of these semiconductors (presumably microcontrollers).
Russia was not on this list.
Wow!
In the United States, with their expensive workforce, it is profitable, but in Russia, it is not profitable!
And my mother-in-law drove me crazy.
I feel sorry for her, she is not with us.

But apart from hatred, gossip, scandals, there is not much to remember.
I feel sorry for her, she has lived a bitter life.
Mercedes lodges protest over Abu Dhabi Grand Prix result
The German Mercedes team, whose driver Lewis Hamilton finished second at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix behind Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, has lodged a protest against the final race result, the Formula 1 press service reports.
Mercedes believes that the rules of Formula 1 48.12 and 48.8 were violated during the race.
In the first case, the German team is challenging the judges' decision to return the round-the-track riders to one lap behind the leaders.
According to the second - Verstappen overtook Hamilton before the allowed "restart" zone.

G7 warns Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
The G7 foreign ministers warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, the final statement said.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces on the country's borders.
“There should be no doubt in Russia that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs,” the statement, published on the UK government’s website, said.
G7 ministers and the EU's top diplomat said they were "united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine."
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned of "big consequences" for Russia if it invades Ukraine at a press conference in Liverpool.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to abandon its aggression against Ukraine," she said (quote from TASS).
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, the foreign ministers of the G7 agreed that to resolve the crisis caused by the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
This was about negotiations in the ‘Normandy format’.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) also called for dialogue in the Normandy format.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "signed up to their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes."

Ways to recover money stolen through online stores revealed
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
To reduce the risk of large losses if the details of a bank card fall into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account, which are not used for online shopping.
Some savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen during purchases in stores that do not use the 3D Secure security technology, you can start the refund process.
‘In accordance with the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorised transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility falls on the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service’, the representative of Promsvyazbank clarified.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, emphasized that the buyer has the right to file a claim with the bank to dispute the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, the online stores themselves return the funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, member of the Public Chamber, director of the League of Safe Internet, Ekaterina Mizulina reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, and the situation with the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
While Mr. Scholz spoke of his desire to preserve good relations between Germany and Poland for years to come, the leaders of the two countries made no bones about their expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to speak out against the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline, through which Russian gas is to be delivered to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported the efforts of Poland to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the points of contention.
The European Court has fined Poland, establishing that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland has refused to pay the fine, and its top court has ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
Germany's new government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite calls from Poland and the United States, has not publicly committed to stopping the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress on Tuesday that they had reached an understanding with Germany to halt the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior congressional aide said.
German officials did not confirm the reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia crosses the Ukrainian border, a position confirmed by G7 representatives on Sunday.
Dmitry, pay attention.
The view outside the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
We removed the wall between the kitchen and the room, so the second window is partially visible.
In general, those who are not familiar with the initial layout are in doubt.
And I know such apartments very well, and I can clearly see how they rearranged it.
I wish them all the best.
It always surprises me when they write about ways to clean the sink, toilet, window sills, taps.
You wash them once a year on Easter, right, and you have to scrub them clean.
Just don't get dirty.
The Ministry of Communications wants to reward writers with residences
The state will transfer federal property left over from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR to the future Fund for the Support of Russian Writers.
Based on it, writer’s residencies will be created, the newspaper Kommersant reported, citing the Ministry of Communications, which will become the founder of the fund.
The Ministry of Communications is preparing a draft presidential decree on the creation of the Fund for the Support of Russian Writers.
The explanatory note specifies that the fund will be responsible, among other things, for the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Union of Soviet Writers and the Literary Fund.
“A significant number of immovable property objects, previously belonging to the USSR Literary Fund, have been transferred to the ownership of the Russian Federation, including objects located in the writer’s village of Peredelkino, the Leningrad region settlement of Komarovo, and others,” the press service of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media told Parlamentskaya Gazeta.
The draft decree stipulates that the charter of the Fund should reflect that it is "established for the purpose of promoting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers".
‘Creating conditions for creative activity’ means creating writer’s residencies on the basis of the transferred property in different regions of Russia, with comfortable conditions for creativity’, the Ministry of Communications explained to our publication.

Doctors warn of risks of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergei Tokarev warned about the danger of uncontrolled use of anticoagulants after a coronavirus infection COVID-19 and before vaccination against the coronavirus.
Doctor-therapist, immunologist Irina Yartseva told that self-prevention of possible thrombosis after COVID-19 may cause a stroke.
Yartseva explained that anticoagulant drugs are not prescribed to everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in the hospital, and had complications.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood thinners that prevent excessive blood clot formation) as needed.
She said that at the moment there is witchcraft going on - everyone is taking anti-coagulants for a long time and getting complications in the form of haemorrhagic strokes (bleeding into the brain).
Sergey Tokarev, the chief preventive physician of the Urals Federal District, the scientific director of the Society of Specialists in Preventive Medicine, and a doctor of medical sciences, told URA.RU in an interview that Russians are now often taking anticoagulants at random before vaccination against the coronavirus infection.
According to Dr Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the internet and start treating themselves.
There are citizens who, by their own decision, start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And during the preliminary examination before the vaccination, doctors notice bruises.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the reason for the appearance of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the church wall will receive $20,000
A plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will receive a reward.
This is according to a press release from Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at the Lakewood megachurch, where pastor Joel Osteen preaches that devout Christians will be rewarded with wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Coley was repairing one of the church's toilets and found thousands of envelopes of money and checks under the insulation.
He turned the find over to the church, he said, and didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We know what you've done and what you can do," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The discovery appears to be linked to a theft that took place at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks were stolen from a church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, a reward of $25,000 was offered for information about the perpetrators.
Justin Cawley was not eligible for the amount as the award had expired.
Despite this, Crime Stoppers of Houston, a non-profit organization that once offered a $5,000 reward and later received an additional $20,000 donation from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Osteen about money found in the wall of the Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her "characterization as a real person".
This is why the attitude towards it is so negative.
And it's not about the fact that "she is financially much richer than all the scribblers", as they write here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves as arrogantly and provocatively as this lady.

A new case of human infection with the avian flu virus has been recorded in China
A new case of human infection with the highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus has been recorded in China.
This was reported by the RTHK radio station, citing the Hong Kong Department of Health, TASS reports.
The 68-year-old resident of Huizhou, a city in the southern province of Guangdong, contracted the infection while keeping poultry at home.
His condition is assessed by doctors as critical.
The first human case of the H5N6 strain was reported in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports upon entering the country
In Brazil, a judge of the Federal Supreme Court (STF) of Brazil, Luiz Roberto Barroso, has ruled that people entering the country must have a COVID-19 passport.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Persons arriving from countries where the vaccine is not available are also exempt.
“The situation is even more serious if we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s Eve, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which means an increase in tourist traffic,” Barros said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities obliged unvaccinated tourists against the coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
Full protection from COVID-19 revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altshtein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed the scheme for complete protection from the coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by introducing an injection and using a nasal vaccine.
When administered intranasally, IgA is produced in large quantities. This does not happen when the vaccine is injected.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies).
And if you enter both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision on double vaccination yet," the medic said.
Sergey Tokarev, the chief preventive physician of the Urals Federal District, a doctor of medical sciences, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with an injection is the possibility of ceasing to be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help by making the body's defences as strong as possible.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, said that a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic will be caused by the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, such a picture is observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to the dog (he died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm home, food, affection, love and games for a heat, then go ahead.
But Pesel was a well-trained and intelligent dog.
I chose my society and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
It's no joke.
I stopped many owners so that they wouldn't run after their dogs, even though they said that there were 200,000 running (pomskies), I literally grabbed them by the hand and led them in the opposite direction.
In the end, ‘200,000’ chose the owner, not the dog that was running somewhere.
Mass protests against vaccination continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictions and the government's plans to make vaccination against COVID-19 mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spaniards outraged by the government's healthcare policies held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held signs reading "This is a false pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated."
A major protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the Covid certificate is mandatory to access bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was taken by the authorities of several regions of the country amid an increase in the number of coronavirus cases.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The protest started peacefully but then escalated into clashes with police.
A group of demonstrators started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashchevarova-Rudneva is also described as "the first Russian doctor, a doctor of medicine", probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue about it, I think they both deserve the title.
I agree with Zakharova on one thing: the Americans only brought death and plunder to any country they appeared in.

The WHO has already detected "omicron" in more than 60 countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the "omicron" variant of the coronavirus has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO reported on the spread of the strain.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it only became active in late November.
The WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new coronavirus variant.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the delta strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Earlier, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
The same conclusion was reached in the UK.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will replace "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of people infected in the UK alone will be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that the official number of people currently infected with the "omicron" in the Kingdom is several hundred, and according to estimates, up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "omicron" strain, and at the peak more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospital every day.
Which the British health service will struggle to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to the latest research, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 32 times less effective against the "omicron" strain than against other types of the disease.
How "Sputnik V" reacts to "omicron" in Russia is not yet known - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has only just begun testing the Russian vaccine against the "omicron" strain.

Our Leningrad communal apartment with Big Zelenina supports communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to preserve warm relations between the older generation.
Perhaps this is due to the fact that there were no guests in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and the siege brotherhood was not cancelled.
Unfortunately, we see each other more and more at funerals.

Seven people died as a result of flooding in Brazil
At least seven people died and 175 were injured as a result of heavy rains that hit the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and the neighboring Minas Gerais.
This is reported by TASS, citing the rescue services.
Since the middle of the week, an extratropical cyclone has been raging on the border of these states. As a result, the level of precipitation in the region has reached 450 mm. In 25 municipalities in the state of Bahia, a state of emergency has been declared, and in some of them, flooding has become the most destructive in 35 years.
Several bridges, two river dams, and three roads have been destroyed by the floodwaters.
According to rescuers, about 5,700 people were left without a roof over their heads, and another 6,700 were forced to leave their homes.
More than 85,000 people in the region were affected by the natural disaster.

$135 billion went to apps - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending in apps grew 25% worldwide, while downloads grew 8%.
Various video services turned out to be the most popular in the world.
Most users downloaded the video editor CapCut, and spent the most on YouTube.
And the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed significant growth from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. User spending in apps increased by 25%, reaching a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, the world economy came out of lockdown and began post-pandemic recovery.
“Will such a ‘return to physical’ growth in the economy of applications slow down? Not at all,” the authors of the report believe.
India was the leader in terms of app downloads, accounting for around 20% of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
iOS users, as before, spent more than Android users: iOS accounted for 65% of all app spending.
Among applications, the video editor CapCut took first place in terms of downloads in 2021.
It is followed by two Indian apps: video service MX TakaTak and online shopping app Meesho.
Telegram is also in the top 10 most downloaded apps.
In general, if we go by the number of downloads, VPN services (there are two in the top 10: VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to video creation and streaming (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, there are two more such services in the top 10: Moj and SnackVideo).
“Users spent the most on apps for live streaming and online streaming,” the report’s authors note.
Leading here is YouTube, TikTok video service, Disney+ and HBO Max streaming video services, and the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom, TikTok, and the mobile version of Microsoft Office occupy the first places in terms of the number of monthly active users.
In Russia, the AliExpress shopping app turned out to be the leader in terms of the number of downloads in a year.
Zenly, a service that shows the location of friends, and CapCut, are following in its footsteps.
Also in the top 10 apps are online karaoke StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, the Maps for Minecraft PE app, online taxi service DiDi, the Pure Tuber YouTube client, the Dixi retailer app, and the Samokat online store.
Around the world, people have adapted to the pandemic by embracing the mobile lifestyle, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The sectors that achieved the greatest success were those that helped people to be closer, both virtually and physically," said Lexi Sydow, head of market insights at App Annie.
The revenue of the mobile games sector in 2021 reached $9 billion. The leaders in terms of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, in which there is no or almost no plot, and the video formatting is minimal.
The top 3 most popular games in the world are Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the most popular games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends of next year, the company's analysts named the growth of the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growth of the popularity of financial applications, for example the Robinhood investment app, among Generation Z, and the further increase in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians have been warned about a new scam
Criminals have started looking for new ways to commit fraud in video messages.
This is reported by Izvestia, citing experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, director of products at Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings of the victim.
Thanks to this, neural networks are able to accurately reproduce the behavioral characteristics of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfake, the criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video call or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person for distribution with the purpose of blackmail.
These fakes can easily trigger bullying, as a savvy perpetrator can put people in embarrassing, dangerous or compromising fake scenarios," the expert said.
Varonis lead systems engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically, people tend to trust others more when they can see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video-based technologies.
David, I add.

Five actions to avoid diabetes
High blood sugar is one of the most common problems in the world.
However, some do not take this seriously, and that is a mistake.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play the main role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to plain water positively affects metabolism.
Sugary foods raise blood sugar to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
So the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
Not only an unhealthy diet, but also habits can affect the onset of the disease.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts recommend following a low-carb diet.
Such a diet not only helps to lose weight, but also protects from sharp swings in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Fibre fills the stomach and thus contributes to the feeling of satiety, the secretion of digestive juices and the absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about "weekend migraines" in workaholics
Several factors can lead to feeling worse over the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working days is often ‘weekend migraine’, Zhuhra Pavlova, a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine at MGU, and scientific director of the Systemic Medicine Clinic, wrote in her Telegram channel.
According to her, especially often suffer from this workaholics, whose weekends are marked by headaches, exhaustion and weakness.
Dr Pavlova noted that, in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are enough objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to the change in conditions.
Our lives change fundamentally over the weekend.
“We sleep for a long time, we lie on the sofa all day, we probably eat more and drink less, - the doctor argued. - Because of the lack of coffee, there is a slight withdrawal.
Because of overeating and lack of water - heavy and broken".
The late rise also plays a role.
For example, if you get up three hours later than usual, you will experience jet lag.
It occurs in travellers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays the decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most over the weekend.

South African scientists say Pfizer vaccine is less effective against Omicron
South Africa reports low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
South African scientists conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to (the level of) vaccine effectiveness of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which... casts doubt on the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, the text of the study, published on the MedRxiv portal, says.
At the same time, specialists clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in Britain with more hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar in familiar products?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under an unfamiliar ingredient in a product, hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition and glycemic index - may be listed.
The label may list dozens of names, in effect, for sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
Other refined sugars include dextrose (corn sugar), levulose (fruit sugar), melasse (black treacle), agave syrup etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which are mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, and to pay attention to labels and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar taste different, but no matter what the ingredient is called in a product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it's still sugar.
It can be difficult to know exactly how much sugar is in a product, as you need to take into account not only the amount of sugar stated on the packaging by the manufacturer, but also that vegetables, fruits, etc. naturally contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than what is indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
Germany's new Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the import of gas is losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045 and become a climate-neutral country.
‘So, in 25 years, the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role’, said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany remains committed to the idea that Ukraine will continue to transport Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is currently important for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the United States made a statement in which the support of Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, during the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also noted that the pipeline currently "does not meet the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers break into PM Modi's Twitter account
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The criminals managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognised bitcoin as a legal payment method, and that the country had already bought cryptocurrency.
Modi's office was asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
In 2020, the page of the Prime Minister of India was already hacked and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
Majority in New Caledonia vote against independence in referendum
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12 at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755) voted in favor of independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, and more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia took part in the elections.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections was never in doubt," as pro-independence supporters called on voters to boycott the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago hinders a full-fledged and "honest" pre-election campaign.
This non-participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, and in 2020, 53.3% did.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to address the results of the referendum on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, it was reported.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has dominated the French presidential campaign in recent weeks.
Several presidential candidates have spoken out in favour of the territory remaining French, as it is "the last European Union presence in the Pacific".
‘New Caledonia must remain French’, Eric Zemmour has repeatedly said.
The same statement was made by Valérie Pécresse, the Republican candidate, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility".
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed a "strong desire that the Caledonians' choice be France's choice."
Hey, Svetlana!

WSJ Readers Criticize Article on Russia-U.S. Relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the article expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and made a number of insulting statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end Hartwell called on Western countries "to stand together against Russia."
WSJ readers disagreed with the American professor.
“There is a lot of false information in this article,” RIA Novosti quotes one of the readers.
“Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never go to war with Russia over Ukraine," another said.

A 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred near the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Shikotan Island.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine to start producing new-generation jet drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, work will begin on creating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was announced on December 11 by the advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are capable of acting against airborne objects, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the body and so on," Dialog.ua quoted him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drones, Arestovich said that they are jet-propelled, not piston-propelled.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpass him "in all characteristics".
The first batch of drones should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was developed by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
Turkey has been developing the drone since 2010 in collaboration with a number of private companies.
The day before, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine classified information about the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the United Forces in the Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that a plant for the production of modern military drones had begun construction in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in the Kyiv region, where personnel will be trained, as well as tests and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar drones.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions escape at Singapore's Changi Airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions settled on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from him because there was a protective net nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all of Singapore's zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, and no people were hurt.
Experts warn of cancer risk from vitamin B9
Studies have shown that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, such as colorectal.
However, exceeding the necessary dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor Beth Kitchin, a dietitian at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, advises keeping track of how much folic acid is consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this number in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablet form without a doctor's recommendation, and to always watch the dosage and avoid cereal with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutritionist Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
As it is found in avocados, among other things, Fein recommended that men over 50 eat them more often.
In the UK, up to 75,000 people may die by April due to the omicron strain
British scientists' forecasts show that, due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus, up to 75,000 people may die in England in the next five months if restrictions are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, citing an expert study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies at the British Cabinet Office, by April 2022, at least 25,000 deaths will be recorded in the country due to the omicron strain, and a total of 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the epidemic, hospitals will be treating more than 2,000 infected people every day.
Tougher measures to tackle coronavirus may be needed to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed if the Omicron variant is more infectious than the Delta variant and existing vaccines cannot prevent infection, said Rosanna Barnard, a mathematician at LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the rate of spread of the omicron strain remains at the current level, about 1 million cases will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the Omicron variant could become dominant in the UK.
There are now 1,898 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in the UK - up 633 in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid pointed out that in reality, this figure could already be 10,000 cases.
I wanted to write a smart comment, but I got to this point:
“A fur coat made from the suffering of an unfortunate animal and its second job.”

Demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter worldwide
Superyacht construction this year and orders for next year are breaking records around the world, despite calls to cut the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
1,200 yachts were ordered in the World Register of Ships, which is 25% more than last year.
In an era of tackling the consequences of climate change, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and the money for a floating fortress costing £50m or more will not diminish, the Guardian writes.
But their numbers are growing.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been such a frenzy on the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of being infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Previously, all these people went to the office and met their business partners in person, but now the vast majority of them work remotely, and conduct negotiations via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that yards are taking orders for new yachts in 2025 and beyond.
This means that buyers are willing to pay more to get their yacht delivered at least a year or two earlier.
“People just want freedom, and the super-rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior by the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, don't want to understand that in times of austerity, holidays in space, life on yachts or flights on private jets cause resentment because the elite doesn't want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and are proposing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, even though they know it will be extremely difficult to enforce in a world where money is so mobile.
Meanwhile, the number of superyachts ordered is impressive, but so are their specifications.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a stern length of over 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke is building the 183-metre yacht REV Ocean.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool" and a submarine designed to explore the ocean depths.
Helipads, open-air cinemas and fighting platforms have become commonplace on existing superyachts, while on some, such as McGregor's, there is a platform for martial arts. Professor of economic anthropology at the University of Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is negligible.
But it has symbolic significance, given that there are fewer than 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
It's just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the carbon footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter on the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emissions came from his yacht Eclipse, which is 162.5 metres long.
Even if the owner is not on board, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Yacht owners don't elicit sympathy from other people when they, like Australia's richest woman, Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain on YouTube that there's nowhere to dock their giant boats.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol that leads to bowel cancer has been identified
American scientists have determined how much alcoholic beverages per week increase the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that drinking four or more units of alcohol a week is linked to an increased risk of developing cancer.
The risk of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, men who drink moderately have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of such a type of cancer, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process in the body.

Sergei, I see nothing wrong with egoism and pride.
Just as you don't see the egoism and arrogance in the man who is looking for a surrogate mother for free, to dump the costs and responsibilities on her and enjoy the fatherhood from a safe distance.
Why are they working in the ministry, they should be in the circus.
I understand that everything should have been on a royal scale, but the model is very exaggerated.

After all, most little girls dream of being princesses in beautiful puffy dresses, and I'm no exception.
But looking at this dress, I changed my mind about being a princess.
Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old
Many, if not all, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they don't realise how advanced four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligent animals are.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can respond sequentially to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' findings were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics or art, but they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data for precise conclusions.
Some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses, such as Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of their ability to learn, they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine prepares for US-Russia trade war
The United States and Russia will "haggle" over Ukraine's accession to NATO, said analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the "Glavred" publication.
According to him, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations in the near future regarding US guarantees that Ukraine will not join NATO, despite the words of US leader Joe Biden about the right of countries "to join wherever they want".
If you are offered something that is obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you are not going to haggle, but simply send the offerer away.
And as for Ukraine, there is a deal in the works," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but rather wants to engage in dialogue with Kiev.
“The preparations are carried out secretly, quickly, and they immediately go on the offensive, rather than waiting until the formation is discovered and forces are deployed to counter it,” he noted.
China stimulates the development of railway transport
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province /Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said company representative Hou Zhaowei.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operability of rolling stock.
In the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway transportation equipment, and many Asian and European countries have witnessed the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first high-speed trains designed in China and destined for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
Travelling at a maximum speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, trial operation of the metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run along the metro line connecting the centre of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The metro line will open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
“China’s railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness,” said Feng Yaxiong, head of the Department of Trade and Investment of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade /CCPIT/.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of China’s production of high-end equipment on the global market,” said Feng Yaoying.
After more than 60 years of intense work, China has created an advanced railway equipment manufacturing system, with a complete set of auxiliary means and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoyan, the country ranks first in the level of electrification of railways and in the mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin, in a conversation with Radio Sputnik, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of mild cognitive impairments, such as difficulty concentrating, planning, and abstract thinking.
Currently, there is discussion about whether hearing loss can be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease or one of the risk factors for its development, the specialist said.
Golosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebral atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, the risk of developing dementia can be reduced by studying foreign languages and actively communicating.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense engagement of memory and logic thinking
“There are recommendations for the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being debated in the scientific community,” Golosheykin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logical thinking,” Golosheikin said.
Earlier this year, Alzheimer's Research UK said the disease was increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Medics name early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be problems with vision, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is aphasia - a condition where a person cannot find the right words to say what they want to say.
The neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychoneurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the consilium of doctors created by the Georgian ombudsman, told journalists.
His neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, and variability of character," the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the normative limits, and now the former president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
‘This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia’, said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage his access to medical care after prison service staff disciplined him.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore himself to his previous rights.
Alexandra, "You're getting paid for this?" - I'm interested to know where such people come from...
It's normal to pay for bread in a bakery, but not for the work of a tutor?
Or are we so holy that we eat prana?
There is another side to this coin.
These people are parasites on the body of society.
They do not work, do not pay taxes, live on benefits and at the expense of their relatives.
At the same time, they receive full medical care.
How many mouths can a working man feed?
We feed all the alcoholics and drug addicts, who also lost their health due to their own stupidity.
Then we are surprised by the extension of the retirement age.
These sums could be spent on treating really sick people.

Protests in Spain against COVID passports
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, reports the Europa Press news agency.
Approximately 3,000 people took part in the action in the Catalan capital.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports became mandatory to enter bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
Many demonstrators came to the rally without masks.
The slogans on their posters accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respecting the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have denounced a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected since the start of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia also plans to impose restrictions on the unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places where mass events are held, cultural institutions, catering establishments and retail outlets with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a previous illness, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will apply to train and air travel.

Steep climb: how the Chinese are becoming skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create world-class resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to engage in winter sports, which will allow it to collect the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward and remote provinces.
Taibai ski resort in Zhangjiakou, near the site of the 2022 Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese.
In addition to building infrastructure in the region, landscaping work is also being carried out: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snowfall.
The main task for the long term is to ensure comfortable and interesting holidays in Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Consultant to the Games, Justin Downes, says since his last visit in 2007, China's ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every winter, more and more Chinese head to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
It will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downes believes.
Many resorts are in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
Gao Macong, 70, lives in Chunli, near the Winter Olympics venues.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, and now no one suffers from unemployment.
More and more shops selling clothes and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
Restaurants serving national cuisine are opening on the slopes.
Taiwu now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China is aiming to create a thriving winter sports industry, with its athletes leading the way at major international competitions and resorts and equipment reaching world-class standards.
More than 500 million people worldwide could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which has set back global progress on universal health coverage, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the December 12 International Day of Universal Health Coverage, WHO and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
In them, they acknowledged that the pandemic had led to disruptions in the provision of health services, had caused excessive strain on health systems.
As a result, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population with immunization has fallen, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria have increased.
WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, with nearly four billion people lacking social protection.

Reuters: Taiwan's minister was disconnected from the "Democracy Summit" broadcast at the request of the White House
Taiwan's Digital Minister Audrey Tang's appearance at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized "Summit for Democracy" was muted, according to a YouTube recording of the summit.
The Reuters news agency, citing sources, reports that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the cause was a map in which Taiwan was highlighted in a different color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms Tan was compiled by South African civil society organisation CIVICUS and ranked countries around the world according to the extent of civil liberties.
Taiwan was marked green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were marked red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the image of her was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the discussion participants "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Democracy Summit."
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could contradict Washington's "one China" policy.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was displayed, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized “Summit for Democracy” was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Novaya Gazeta editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money earned through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of Russia Yuri Averianov said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

They do not boil the meat, but the horns and hooves, obtaining a substance similar to glue.
The finished product looks like a yellow semi-transparent strip almost without smell and hard like plastic, used as natural gelatin.

My personal contribution to the environment is to avoid buying things I don't need and to use them for a long time.
If I go overboard, I don't throw it away, but donate it to charity.

The New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight
The New Shepard spacecraft of the Blue Origin company with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight on Saturday, December 11.
The journey, which was broadcast on the company's website, lasted more than ten minutes in total, after which the capsule with the passengers descended to Earth, TASS reports.
The launch of the rocket carrier was carried out from the spaceport in the area of the American city of Van Horn (Texas).
The ship rose to a height of just over 100 km, and the space tourists found themselves in a state of weightlessness.
The rocket-carrier itself landed on the launch pad of the cosmodrome.
On July 20, Blue Origin successfully carried out the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers on board.
SKETCHES OF A VILLAGE MOSCOWITE.
Don't lump them all together - there are bad people out there, and you may have a legitimate complaint about a particular person...
but what does the number of children, age, pension fund and so on have to do with it?
Write that they are "scoundrels who did not return the money."
But how many and when they have children is none of your business until they decide to hang them around your neck.
And if this is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
Perhaps it is only in education that...
Elected (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, blatantly ignoring existing ones.
And what about other areas of life, the judicial system, etc.?
There are no laws for them.
And what if the father does implement his method of upbringing and education?
What a horror and a bad example for others.

China strengthens epidemic prevention and control of COVID-19 in cities with land ports of entry
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China has issued a circular to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities with land ports of entry in order to further prevent the importation of the infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the designated cities must provide a negative nucleic acid test result for COVID-19 obtained within 48 hours of departure.
Those arriving in land border points of entry must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the document, these requirements will be in effect from the date when the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of these cities until March 15, 2022.
Furthermore, it is noted that cities where land border crossing points are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sergei Ryabkov evaluated the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington in an interview with Izvestia.
He noted that a long path of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of any prospects for improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion after a long journey that we've been on with this administration, with Trump, with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat noted.
According to Ryabkov, the problems stem from the United States trying to impose approaches to a number of issues on Russia.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he would not dare to give optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in the position of Washington.
He explained that, with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there is no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to adopt a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and that the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the US.
Virologist warns of danger of nasal COVID vaccine outside hospitals
Those who have been vaccinated with the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may develop an allergic reaction and require medical assistance, so the first vaccination points should not be set up in airports and shopping centres.
Virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology at Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov told TASS about this.
Setting up vaccination points for the nasal vaccine at airports and shopping centres is easier, but I would only do this at first in medical facilities.
The thing is that there is a possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is better that a person sits next to the doctor’s office after that.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work within a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it is possible to think about vaccination in shopping centres when there is experience in using the drug.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a risk that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated sneezes after being sprayed.

Serbia has produced 2 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine
The Sputnik V vaccine is most popular in Serbia.
Serbia has produced around 2 million doses of the Russian vaccine "Sputnik V", TASS reported, citing the country's minister of innovation and technological development, Nenad Popović.
“Around 2 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine have been produced at the Torlak Institute to date, and we expect to produce at least 4 million in the coming period,” Popovic said.
According to him, the Russian vaccine is the most popular among Serbs.
In connection with this, the republic plans to make an additional purchase of a million doses of the vaccine from Russia.
The Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of Serbia also expressed interest in producing the nasal vaccine "Sputnik V" and the "Sputnik Light" drug on the territory of the state.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said that Russia had delivered almost two million doses of the domestic coronavirus vaccine "Sputnik V" to Serbia.

Alexander M., Remind me, please, how the marathon was run at the 2021 World Championships?

Attention, question - what does Klebo do to the right of Bolshunov and how does he want to get onto the ski track if he was behind him at the turn before the start?
And "best finisher" over 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.

First, as king, he occupied the axis!
A line formed behind me.
Missed.
Then the belt on the GUR broke.
Then the traffic police stopped us.
There was an organised column, and their car broke down.
It needs to be towed.
The owner of the MAZ explained that he was drunk and the driver was inexperienced.
And to him - how drunk are you?
You don't trip, you don't fall.
Ahead of us with flashing lights and full speed ahead!
As far as I'm concerned, he's the one who should be crying.

In the UK, 1,239 cases of the omicron strain of the coronavirus were recorded in a day - RT on Russian
In the UK, 1,239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of coronavirus were detected in 24 hours.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new variant of the infection in Scotland, and five - in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with COVID-19 from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast calculated that in England by April, due to the outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the "omicron" strain, 75 thousand people may die.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that are introducing anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continuing "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the territory of the country.
“It is impossible to impose restrictions on Russia and not suffer yourself,” the Kremlin spokesman said in an interview with Russia 1.
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world" understands this.
Earlier, it was reported that the United States was considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will complicate the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is convinced that this is impossible.
From reasonable thinking people - correspondingly reasonable comments!
Something about these simple to the point of nausea recipes makes me want to vomit.

Even in my distant childhood, my mother baked delicious pies and cakes, and it never occurred to me to compare a slice of bread with jam to a cake.
Ksenia, you don't need to bring anything to my mind, my mind is obliged to figure it out itself!
“The inability of the mind, separated from the Spirit, to perceive” – what are you talking about?!
Imagine that you need to explain this to a naive child using your fingers, how would you do it?!
Remember, a child under 3-5 years old still has open channels of communication with the subtle world, and the child may know more than you do!)
New Caledonians reject independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, an overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of those who voted opposed independence.
3.51% of the islanders in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
Voter turnout on the day was very low: about 55% of the archipelago's population went to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by calls from separatists to boycott the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
A referendum on independence was held in the region in 2018.
Most residents supported the archipelago remaining part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Around 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative-territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and New Caledonia allows the region to hold two referendums on independence, two years apart.

WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily believes that "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines against the new COVID-19 variant.
As of December 9, "omicron" has been registered in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the “omicron” strain protein allow us to assume a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against the infection and the transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it may be less severe than "delta", the WHO said in a technical note.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of infection with "omicron" in the EU have been mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than Delta.
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center said.
Head of Russia's Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing Anna Popova said that there is no reliable data on the fact that the new coronavirus variant is less dangerous than the others.

Four scenarios for Zelensky have been named in Ukraine
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may lose the support of the West, and he may also compromise on the Donbass.
On Sunday, 12 December, Denisenko spoke about this in a publication on the "Glavred" portal.
The first scenario, which Denisenko called an "ideal storm," assumes that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
This development will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
‘At the same time, there is a reduction in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export ... internal protests and confrontation with the authorities by key FPGs (financial-industrial groups. - Ed.)’, the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against everyone".
This forecast will come true if there is high turbulence in world politics, in which Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the leadership of Ukraine may go for compromises on the Donbass, which may lead to confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, the positions of Zelensky will weaken, the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between groups of the population that disagree with Zelensky and the president, which could lead to the seizure of control over the power block and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting power," added Denisenko.
Another scenario is turning Zelensky into the “father of the nation”.
This can be caused by some event that becomes a major shock to society.
“The event must be significant enough to elicit a response from external partners and increase support for Ukraine,” Denisenko said.
Such a development of events is possible as a result of a natural disaster, technogenic catastrophe or aggressive actions by Russia, the former deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has already more than once rejected any possibility of "attacking" Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the results of a survey by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the president's rating had fallen to a record low, at 19.3%.
This is the lowest level since he became head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential elections in Ukraine, 21.8% would have voted for Zelensky, while 14.5% would have voted for the former president of the country, Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of those surveyed expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete. I didn’t know that Elena Shushunova had died. It’s very sad to hear such news.
I remember cheering for her at the Seoul Olympics, for us, residents of Primorsky Krai, it was a live broadcast, real time.
There was such passion, emotions were running high, I remember the joy when Elena won.
We also rejoiced in the other victories, as we cheered for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the Soviet athletes.
I once saw a documentary on television about one of the Central American countries, and there they were rolling watermelons down the gangplank like barrels.
The watermelons were huge.
I myself worked many times in my youth picking and loading watermelons in Astrakhan Oblast and never met a watermelon weighing more than a pud.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg straight from the vineyard and not before the beginning of August.
A balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, colour: beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article number: 12008).
A balconette bra with soft lace cups on a frame.
The lower part of the cup is reinforced with a non-elastic transparent fabric.
The side inner part of the cup, in the area of attaching the strap, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that prevents the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated by the frill along the neckline and under the bust.
The vertical bones on the side panels of the one-layer microfiber do not allow the fabric to twist on large sizes.
I didn't like the article at all, it was nasty and poisonous.

But now it suits a lot of people to break people down into atoms.
I hope that the commentators are honest and knowledgeable.

Poet arrested for action on Red Square: "For quoting Evtushenko, you get 10 days, that's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for 10 days.
A student at HSE was detained on Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #poetrossiibolshechempoet was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Evgeny Evtushenko.
An administrative protocol was drawn up against Alexander for repeated violation of the order of conducting a public rally.
He was arrested for the first time on 23 January on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
“The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, but unfortunately, interest in it has been lost. There is a decline in culture in general in Russia, and there is also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems online under this hashtag,” explains Alexander.
We spoke to the young poet to find out more about the circumstances of his arrest and to delve deeper into the message of his poem.
How did the police officers treat you when you were detained this time and previously?
What did they ask in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time the officers were more polite, the detention was the maximum, courteous, as it may sound funny in some context of this word.
On Pushkinskaya, the OMON took people hard.
They asked the standard question about motives.
When we heard, in principle, we looked if not approvingly, then understandingly.
Apart from the windswept monkey enclosure, it was all very correct, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if, after the action under this hashtag, people start writing their own poems, even just a few, I will not have wasted those 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, talk privately in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of their surroundings so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian very well and yet she uses an interpreter.
And official meetings are still transcribed by hand, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.
If you don't want to say much, just say no!

Scientists reveal how potatoes can help fight age-related diseases
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals that help improve circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains group B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the body's systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to its high content of pectin, it is good for the gastrointestinal tract, and regular consumption can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable should be stewed or boiled, rather than fried in oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are foods that contain carbohydrates that are quickly broken down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper Kommersant warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in their production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the current shortage of products can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex search results
Relegation candidates
In 2015, the copyright holders from the cluster "RAEC/Media" compiled a list of 100 largest pirate sites in Runet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, the general director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - have managed to survive thanks to, among other things, a regular change of domain names, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in search results for both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia, Ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated newcomer Encanto, but judging by the quality of the video, this is so-called screening (a pirated copy of the film filmed in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 Years Later" from the TNT channel (part of Gazprom Media) is available.
Svetlana M., excuse me, of course, but I don't give a damn whether my son is offended for me or not.
If we have any misunderstandings, it's better not to get involved, to avoid a collision.
It's good, of course, that this happens rarely.

Lyudmila, advanced space technology is now in China.
Russia is already hopelessly behind.
“This developed Polish idea” – it would be more accurate to say that Poland merely reworked the idea of 1776, but developed it quite effectively.
In fact, the slogan “The periphery is not Russia” appeared in 1848.
Which, in general, does not change the essence.
I watched her interview, and the girl said that her biggest dream was to grow wings, and her dad was always pulling her back.
Well, this is all very dubious.
Well, she got into the university, but then what?
Wall lamp Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
A wide ring, surrounded by "molecules" of light, provides the most uniform and bright illumination of the space.
‘Atomic’ or ‘molecular’ design, reflecting the essence and natural nature of each object, is not losing its relevance and allows you to effectively accentuate the interior.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is the lightness of the structure.
Thanks to the fine, almost invisible cables that can be adjusted in height, the chandelier seems to float in the air.
The metal gold armature and matte white miniature shades will easily complement any palette, and the chandelier and sconce presented in the collection will become a ready-made ensemble for lighting the living room, bedroom, hallway.
Well, to each his own.
I really liked "Tarhun", of course, not the current one.
Very tasty were the juices on tap from high glass cylinders.
Three servings of syrup is overkill, in my opinion.
Two were just right.
Dimax Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two different levels of firmness - high firmness and slightly above average.
The product includes only high-quality and premium fillings, which have proven themselves to be excellent.
Springs: in the center of the model is a block of independent springs "micro package".
This means that there are 2,000 coils per sleeping area, which work completely autonomously.
It is their operation that provides the unique fine-tuning.
“Micro-pack” is the most high-frequency of all the variety of Dimax spring blocks, so it has a very pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: on top and bottom of the springs are combinations of layers of coir and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut coir.
Such a combination of fillings has long been a classic, as it not only gives the mattress orthopaedic properties, but also anatomical ones.
If the coir provides the right support for the back, then the latex adapts the surface to the body.
Cover: the model is supplied in a Aloe Vera terry cloth cover.
At the customer's request, it can be made removable or fixed.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping surface is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full safety and reliability in use.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in collaboration with Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, Aktuaalne Kaamera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions launching in five years is to assess the habitability of Venus' clouds, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools for measuring the acidity and oxygen content of Venus clouds.
Venus, the closest planet to Earth, was thought to be too acidic for life to exist in its clouds, but it is likely that Venus started out as an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
If we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to life on Earth or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that life on Earth did not begin on Earth.
If it differs, then it is more likely that life originated on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project, Mihkel Pajusalu.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The metaverse trend took off this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
The event was an important signal for the market: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend of creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, because people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the one hand, this is the result of businesses’ desire to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money move into a digital format.
Anna, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating properly, you no longer want something too fatty and unhealthy.
Of course, we will have our traditional olive salad and herring under a fur coat, but no one is forcing me to eat everything at once.
You can eat a spoonful, try it - and that's enough.
After all, there are ten days of holidays ahead, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.
And how much hellish effort, time, and resources were required of her in training.
And after performing five quadruple jumps, she was left without gold.
And she also understands that in four years until the next Olympics, she will never be an Olympic champion.
And those who weren't simply athletes or can't imagine all the circles of hell she's been through, DON'T JUMP TO JUDGMENT.
British economist unable to forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to make a forecast for 2022 as, in his opinion, such attempts would end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability, and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, with inflation coming in second, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted he doesn't know if the price hikes are temporary or not.
According to the expert, even before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of endless generosity of central banks had run its course" and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates net of inflation would correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that, amid the pandemic, continuing with ultra-easy monetary policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new spike in inflation.
In addition, it is important to note the issue of productivity growth, as well as rising poverty and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, the head of the global research department at Opening Investments, Mikhail Shulgin, said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 remain, but the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin named the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices, and fears amid the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is encouraging: if you compare yourself with yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There is progress, but it is sluggish.
Another problem is that there are a lot of environmental initiatives in cities, but people don’t know about them.
All sorts of eco-taxis that collect waste from homes.
A simple recycling point - it's used by marginals.
Few people bring glass and metal there.

Russians have given car dealers around 4.5% of the country's GDP
In the first 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than for the same period last year, according to statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI).
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
In September last year, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia leads the Russian market in terms of revenue.
In the first 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year ago.
The related Kia brand, Hyundai, has grown by more than 35%, and the revenue from selling cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is also in the lead when it comes to increasing the average selling price of a car – over the past year, Hyundai’s average selling price has increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles. The only brands with a stronger price increase were Changan, Chery, Geely, and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, the volume of sales of Korean brands grew not so significantly: according to statistics from the Committee of Automobile Manufacturers of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period than the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Rounding out the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms is the Japanese Toyota – Russians spent 27.55 billion rubles on cars of this brand over the past 10 months, which is 14% more than a year ago.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand saw both sales volume (up 37%) and the average price of a car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz is simultaneously experiencing a good increase in sales and an average price - more, for example, than BMW - which is why there is also a greater increase in financial capacity, - explained NAPI CEO Tatyana Arabadzhie. -
The Chinese brands are showing fantastic growth rates, also significantly increasing their financial capacity this year."
Lada, the Russian brand, demonstrates average market dynamics (plus 28%) in terms of revenue growth. Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand over the past 10 months.
At the same level as last year in terms of financial capacity are companies whose car sales in units fell in 2021: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is even in the red – over the past 10 months, Russians have spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand, compared to 12.4 billion rubles a year ago.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of automotive components and disruptions in production, which have affected the entire global automotive industry, automotive companies continue to constantly adjust prices – Lada, for example, has raised the price of its models seven times this year, with the last increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) taking place at the end of November.
Other car manufacturers regularly change the prices of their products.
The volume of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to grow – in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation and the desire of automotive manufacturers to make up for past losses are contributing to this, experts believe.
Given the shortage of cars, I think that many car manufacturers were even able to partially transfer the costs of previous periods to the consumer, which they could not include in the price of cars earlier,
says the automotive analyst at VTB Capital Vladimir Bespalov.
I believe that automotive manufacturers are currently feeling very good financially, with high margins on sales."
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which has been observed in 2021, new car prices are growing faster than inflation, explains the expert.
In the long term, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and money, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the construction of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With more supply, the ability to raise prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian automotive market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, car manufacturers will be able to get their profits from the volumes, says Sergei Burgazliev, an independent automotive consultant.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, now car manufacturers are trying to get the maximum profit from each sold car, notes Burgazliyev. -
An increase in the volume of machine production is not expected at least for the next six months, while in Russia the hype is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens about the future.
Against the backdrop of the situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its initial cost, the expert notes.
Biden spoke about the deployment of US troops to Ukraine in case of a Russian invasion
The United States has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a "Russian invasion."
US President Joe Biden made such a statement.
“There’s never been such a plan,” the White House chief said in response to a reporter’s question about whether the US had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO do not have an obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will deploy forces to eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Estonia).
“We’re going to have to move more American and NATO forces to the eastern flank, B9 – all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to defend them from any Russian aggression,” Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading Ukrainian territory.
At the same time, he noted that Moscow sees the problem in the use by Kiev of the drones supplied by Turkey, as well as the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".
I immediately leave such interviews.
If at the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink incomprehensible brew and wash another cup - it is terrifying to imagine what will be at work.
I will find myself a normal place, without the echelon layer, where I can talk directly to the leader.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, pretending to be a "police officer" or a member of another law enforcement agency, then it is ineffective to immediately hang up, and it is likely that you will not have time to add them to the blacklist.
Because in order to confirm his lie about his involvement in the security services, he quickly repeats the call and continues to intimidate and persuade.
The people need more useful recommendations.
What a load of rubbish...
I don't believe it was like that at all.
They don't know what to come up with, who to accuse.

Wouldn't it have been easier to leave people in peace from coercion, of course, if our leaders cared about their people?

As in Japan... before the elections, the influence and the number of infections decreased...

Maria Kartashova, what does "in response to this" mean?
I don't voice my thoughts, I curse you all mentally.
I mentally cut off the heads of all those who did not give way to me, mentally sent to the ditch and burned all the cars that interfere with my passage, mentally everything!
And I can even smile at you.
But I remember that thought is material!

Alexander Sokurov's student's film won the European "Oscar" for best editing
But the Russian film nominated for an Oscar, Clenching Fists, received an award from the European Film Academy (also known as the "European Oscar") in the "Best Editing" category, reports Moscow Komsomolskaya Pravda.
The jury of the competition, which voted online due to the difficult epidemiological situation, appreciated the outstanding mastery of the creators of the film.
The maximum number of awards this time went to the film of Jasmin Dzbanic (Bosnia) "Where are you going, Aida?"
The main character of the film is a translator for the UN mission who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for Kira Kovalenko’s (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov’s workshop) drama Clenching Fists, this film tells the story of the complex relationship between a domineering father and his adult children who want to break free of his authority in North Ossetia.
Earlier it was announced that this film was nominated for an Oscar as the best foreign language film.
As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, I think you have no idea.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian KAMAZ plant.
