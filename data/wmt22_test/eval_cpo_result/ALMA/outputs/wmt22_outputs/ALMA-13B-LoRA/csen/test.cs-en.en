The big comeback of the Czech loser is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 33-year-old Plzeň native will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň or the Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in the preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Exactly halfway through the game against Vegas, he was substituted and has not appeared on the ice in the NHL since then.
The incident happened as the experienced goalkeeper moved from one post to the other.
Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury, the Avalanche announced in early October.
His return to the NHL net ended up lasting more than two months.
On Sunday morning, U.S. time, he was called up from the farm, where he had four fights and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he made 94.5% of his saves.
The Plzeň-born hockey player wants to finally break through and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In the last season, he had problems with his hip, and in the shortened pandemic season, he did not play a single game.
In the NHL, "Francík" played in 36 games, with a save percentage of 92.3%.
Charles puts Camilla in a mask on Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also shared his wish, using a photo of him helping his wife Camilla put on a mask at the races.
The BBC reported on its website.
The wishes are sent to friends, colleagues and charities they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing a long khaki summer dress and so is Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a polo shirt, just like Prince George and Prince Louis.
William and Kate did not say who took the picture, and it is not clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a Christmas card photograph on a bale of straw in front of a pile of logs at their country estate in Norfolk.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also released by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured him at Ascot in June.
Charles, who is wearing a cylinder hat and a face mask, helps Camille put on her mask, which matches her light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminal investigators in the current corruption case reportedly worked on the assumption that the accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, was promised one million Czech crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The efotbal.cz server reported this, having gained access to police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, the chairman of the board of the Vršovice club, stated that the red-and-whites did not commit any corruption.
The server has published a transcript of police recordings, in which Slavia's former sporting director Jan Nezmar, who left the club last summer, features prominently.
According to the indictment, the former influential functionary of the red-whites was in frequent contact with Berbr, as well as with Roman Rogoz, the former sports director of the then second-tier Vyšehrad, who is also involved in the case.
Detectives reportedly worked with the information that Slavia had promised Berbrovi a financial reward if they won the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Prague team won the title in the first league.
The police authority was in possession of the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to receive a million-crown bribe from SK Slavia Prague officials for winning the league, the server cited from the file.
The next day, according to the investigators, Berbr met not only with Nezmara, but also with Tvrdík, the chairman of the board of directors of Slavia.
According to the server, it is not clear from the file whether the police are still investigating this information.
Tvrdík denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to the development of the game.
We have never committed any illegal acts, we have not tried to influence the referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided any financial compensation in connection with this," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the recordings, Nezmar, among other things, insults some former Slavia players with darker skin, and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was triggered by a police raid in mid-October last year at several locations, including the headquarters of the Football Association of the Czech Republic in Prague.
The highest-ranking figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football functions.
In mid-January, he was released from custody in the same way as the former Vyšehrad sporting director Rogoz.
Helicopters, tanks and bvps are larping the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but essentially of a worse type (gunners will have to fire from an armoured turret and carry ammunition by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and armoured vehicles - at a decent level, and Praga V3S has already been phased out in specialised units.
Aircraft: Combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and small, with no combat potential
Rockets - we have none at all (but we manufacture and export them)
PVO: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good numbers.
I have a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the town.
Nutria were climbing out of the river and damaging crops, so I went down there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I calmly sat down and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd go before something came out, but of course the fox is in the henhouse.
I let her come to 40 metres before I decided to shoot.
Poor old fisherman nearly shit himself, waving his torch all over the place, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
Before I dismounted, it was gone.
In other words, a meadow can be a prat.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a series of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen on a thermal imaging camera, which almost everyone has today.
So, in a visible place, put your valuables in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Ministry of the Interior bought respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of respirators, masks and face masks for professions closest to the coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns for their purchase in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the prices for respirators varied by hundreds of crowns on a single day.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved prudently?
And why did others pay more?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Dominika Kubištová, the editor of the iRozhlas website.
I respect soldiers and the army, but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of equipment for the reservists to use, we don't have modern equipment for the current professionals, and modern equipment is becoming increasingly complex, so the reservists' skills will rapidly decline over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can be deployed, will be very fast-paced, and there will be no time to retrain anyone.
And finally, the reserves/territorial defence have a big role to play in countries like Ukraine, where you can lead a mass guerrilla war and it is an absolute necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, it will only be possible to fight in a conflict of such a scale and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not have the appropriate geography.
We lack individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
This then leads to situations where you look like a hero, who 2 minutes ago failed to score an empty goal, as he drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss players, and you think to yourself "what do you think is going to happen now?".
Of course, he will be chosen by the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "to mess up the defender" is so bad that I caught myself being genuinely surprised when I saw that our attacker managed to beat one of the opponent's players.
First swallows
The coronavirus pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major turnaround in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the pressure on hospitals will continue for some time yet, and the pandemic equation now includes a new unknown: the omicron variant, which is probably spreading faster than the currently dominant Delta variant.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course of the disease, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired from a previous infection helps.
This week, however, the covid equation has been joined by an unexpected plus: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic. It reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and hospitalisation by a third, and it can be administered at home.
Soon it will be joined by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which, according to preliminary results, is successful in 85 percent of cases.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, have also highlighted the question of how the Czech administration is prepared for the incoming drugs.
Molnupiravir, made by Merck, will be the first to reach domestic patients.
The company ended up on the list in part because the drug was being developed long before the current pandemic to find a treatment for equine viral diseases in South America.
What is often overlooked in these studies is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
In contrast, Eastern Europeans, and especially the Czechs, are used to speaking their minds.
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you straight out that they don't.
In the West, they will tell you how much they love immigration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and media lynching.
Then it looks good in the polls, West good, East bad.
But do they really know what people think?
Only in France do Le Pen and Zemmoura have more than 20% support, according to the poll.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical.
Due to the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to relearn where everything is, all objects are identical.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
It's funny that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or because of the faster deployment of warheads due to its western location.
In the underground bunkers (there are two in each maple tree) only the warheads, not the entire rocket, were stored.
If it was necessary to use this weapon, a special unit would come to pick up the warhead and mount it on some kind of carrier.
Besides the museum tree, the rest are in a deplorable state.
At secondary school, we had a classmate who was a Gypsy. We were together for four years.
He was alright, he made some good jokes, he was a bit over the top, but he was our mascot.
Everyone liked him, he often came and wanted to explain something, he was missing very little, he came regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he came cleanly dressed.
He went on school trips, did all sorts of pranks, but he was fine, he never got into any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the gypsy siblings entered the same grade, but different classes.
Shortly afterwards, they beat up a teacher, the police were often called there, and they threatened and intimidated other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something on an advertisement (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold it to the Gypsies, they always had money, they didn't try to cheat me on the price, the communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called me back a month later to tell me that he had already re-registered it in his name.
I say to myself that I am not a racist, it doesn't matter if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other colour, as long as they behave in a civilised way (work, function, don't beat women, just normal behaviour).
But when someone comes, stretches out their hand, evicts flats and houses, has chaos around them and causes problems... it doesn't matter what colour they are, but it will bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants if they get involved, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatice
A young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts, she died at the scene from her injuries, the spokesperson for the South Bohemian Ambulance Service, Zuzana Fajtlová, told Právo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot car was probably travelling in the direction of Bavorov from Žíchovec when, for unknown reasons, he drove into the opposite direction in a bend.
After colliding with a Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on its roof outside the road, said Štěpánka Schwarzová, spokeswoman for the South Bohemia Police.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
He suffered multiple injuries and was trapped in the vehicle.
After being freed, he had to receive acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, said Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second car suffered minor injuries to his chest and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to packages from countries outside the EU, customers often fail to provide information
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects collectible cards.
“Usually, it can be tens of dollars, say, from ten dollars upwards, where it is worth importing, especially from Japan, where postage is often free,“ explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small packages has become slightly more expensive, as he now has to add VAT and provide customs information to the post office.
He receives an email informing him that customs are expecting the parcel.
All you have to do is fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT has not been included by the seller, the customs office will calculate it from the total cost of the shipment and transport.
If the recipient does not take care of customs clearance on their own, the shipping fee must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I check one or two checkboxes, add two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it is usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all deliveries go smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the number of international parcels received at Prague's international post office has fallen from 60,000 to 15,000 per day.
According to Česká pošta, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests for information needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 parcels waiting to be processed at the international post office.
If people filled in all the information they need to and did so on time, we would be about halfway there, says Matyáš Vitík, spokesman for the Czech Post.
Inflation solution
See the headline, how would you solve the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What should the state do, in your opinion, to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We can see, for example, that Poland has reduced VAT on food and petrol, is this the way forward for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, so it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much extra did you get (who is an employee)?
I got a 2% pay rise this year, which is a joke, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run alongside my job.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why proven violent offenders are sent to prison for just six months?
I just can't get my head around how a court can sentence an animal to just six months in a cage, just so it can do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the victim of rape will never be the same again.
Won't this deter potential future reports of sexual assault?
A man from Hrob "shot" his girlfriend from Kostomlaty
A man from Hradec Králové unintentionally helped the police to arrest his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlaty nad Labem.
He called her himself.
He went about it in a roundabout way.
He first approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
Officers responded to the emergency line and were stunned when the alleged "victim" told them he made up the story to get the officers to come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to ask the guards how to file a complaint with the Czech Police.
A check on the identity of the man and his girlfriend then revealed that the woman is wanted on a national warrant for arrest.
The case is being investigated by the Police of the Czech Republic.
A genuine question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally Slavs, but I would like to know your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, it's a shame that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's a question whether a rational person can really believe something without evidence just because it might be beneficial.
I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should a person choose?
I would say that it is fairly likely that there is at least one god in one of those thousands of religions that will punish you if you believe in a different god.
After all, the Ten Commandments state that there is no other god but Jahwe.
Wouldn't it therefore be more rational to refrain from believing in any god, rather than risk believing in the wrong one and ending up in hell or some similar place?
Others: Voluntary training followed by reserve service.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specialisations, X months in one) and under the supervision of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All the components of the AČR would benefit from something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can say this: There is a lot of talk about cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies are recruiting in schools and there is a kind of blurring of the lines, with labour migrating from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Something similar should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, which is an institution that guarantees that the Russians, Germans or Mongolian invaders will never return.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if something goes wrong.
Praise the Lord.
All it takes is one election in the United States to cut their budget, and the whole of NATO is in trouble.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that all they need to do is show their backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that guarantees long-term independence is a well-armed army and a population that knows how to operate the military technology of its time.
Today, every teenager knows how to pilot drones, so why not?
We don't need a border fence, that's yesterday's news, but a hulking teenager behind a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a sea of boxes
You open the presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are overwhelmed with boxes and packaging at home?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of shops that welcome your used boxes has been created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them as disposable.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to a participating shop (there are nearly 150 of them on the KAMsNIM.cz project map).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created and also avoid overflowing blue bins.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the saved money, since the packaging carton has increased in price by 50% over the last period.
I am also strengthening my brand in the eyes of environmentally conscious customers.
One such business is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-friendly cleaning products and cosmetics.
Boxes and packaging materials are brought to Popůvky near Brno by individuals who have accumulated them at home, but we also receive enquiries from companies with whom we have agreed regular collections of discarded cardboard.
We will use it when packing parcels from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application also shows collection points for packaging.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand in expired medicines, tyres, old electrical appliances, batteries, light bulbs, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can end up in the right place, and reusable items can find their second home.
In total, the project map contains over 100,000 such places.
Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the app from the association Ukliďme Česko, adds: "Slowly, more and more recycling centres, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places are being added, which help to find a use for things that would otherwise become unnecessary waste."
I think it's bad that today's technology is so simple and idiot-proof that children who use computers or phones to play games don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of components on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo app or mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying file system with folders and display everything on one screen in the app.
They can use the technique from childhood, but most importantly, they should learn something.
Rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron unveiled France's priorities for its EU presidency, which begins in January, and it was grandiose.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work and on the streets - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be completed in half a year.
French politicians like it that way and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters who stand between the right and the left agree on very little, but they do agree on Europe.
And in France there will be new presidential elections in April.
The election calendar has also influenced the priorities.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators rushed to criticise Macron for propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, he is trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
Eric Zemmour, a far-right candidate for the French presidency, is currently touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during the Second World War, was not so bad, and he is having some success.
Let's take Macron's idea of one history book seriously and not look at what is happening in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries are often taught history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French and the Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know the wider context of the event.
Film of the Year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The film, which revisits the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for best director and best actress Jasna Duričič.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Film Festival, it was one of the most popular films.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not that young, I'm not that fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was something like "having a cold/being hungover". For a few days I had diarrhoea and I didn't feel like smoking...
It was worse than the common flu.
I don't have diarrhoea with the flu.
This is only my personal experience. I do not claim that this is the case for everyone.
Christmas book recommendations
The Christmas double issue, to be published on December 20, will include the traditional literary supplement.
And there will also be cultural tips.
These books are included in addition to the digital edition for subscribers, so that you have enough time to buy books as Christmas presents.
Prose texts that follow the previous similar collection by Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another helping of observations of the world and descriptions of everyday things with poetic awareness, depth and atmosphere.
In his second novel, the photographer Šesták tried to capture the essence of small towns and the Czech society.
The story of a return to the roots, which turns out to be just a longed-for illusion.
The bohemist and comparatist transfers the tale of Little Red Riding Hood to the backdrop of a contemporary village.
Its depiction of brutality outstrips the folk versions and builds to a horror of emotional void.
And about the fact that the way back to instincts is shorter than people are willing to admit
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story of a return from emigration than we are used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a life together.
Trains are starting to run according to the new timetable, and in some places the operator is changing
From Sunday, trains will run according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where Czech Railways are replaced by RegioJet.
For the majority of lines, only the departure times will be adjusted, and in some cases the routes will be slightly altered.
There will also be dozens of new trains.
Transport operators started selling tickets during the autumn.
České dráhy plan to run an average of 6,783 passenger trains in the new timetable, of which 478 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the new timetable will also include connections to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company is introducing dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains running on routes from Prague to Cheb.
The operator will also launch new trains in northern Moravia and western Bohemia.
The carrier will also increase ticket prices from next year, on average by 3.2 percent.
Railways factor inflation into their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in RegioJet's timetable is the introduction of line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace České dráhy here after winning a competition organised by the Ministry of Transport.
Every day, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 trains, eight in each direction.
Other changes affect long-distance trains between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at stations in Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín.
Leo Express kept its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep the timetables of its long-distance trains as similar as possible, despite the planned maintenance work.
Trains operated by Arriva and other carriers should continue to run as normal.
The operator will also change in some regional lines.
Travellers can expect changes, for example, on the route from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk, where the Czech Railways will be replaced by the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn.
For the second year in a row, passengers will also be able to use a unified rail ticket.
Their price will increase by 3.2 per cent in line with inflation.
I disagree.
Are we not learning from the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work hard, die.
In my life I have never heard a lesson from the perspective of the slave owners or from that time, no one is defending it, only condemning it.
Nobody will tell you in school that black people often sold black people into slavery and that they were often the worst slave owners.
Nobody will teach you at school that the colonisers often bought the land from the Indians, they will only tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, wiped them out, when they had been killing each other for a long time.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in the north and in the south.
I have not met anyone who deliberately hides facts, but I have heard that this is happening, and I think it is a problem (for example, in Japan, the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about people's feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the situation at the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from this and never repeat it.
Incidentally, while we're on the subject of southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave owners are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealise it today.
And a lot of people forget that not all Southerners were slave owners, and a lot of things went against them.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, they lie and manipulate, and on top of that, our point of view doesn't exist for them (there was also a video on YT from the television, where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What struck me about US schools was the rise of Marxism and idealizing communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that at some universities it was quite shocking, the students were quite radicalised and the schools supported them in that.
And when I think of these people getting much older, it makes me a little sick to think that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has already achieved what it set out to achieve and has become radicalised.
Currently, feminists are those who have nothing to do with him and ignore the basic biological fact, and other groups like LGBT, which leads to radicalization on both sides, which often leads to resistance even to quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, at the end of the day, I haven't met anyone who has condemned me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered bad geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality to be redundant from a personal identity perspective.
If I have anything in common with people, it's interests, world views and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know I can tell you this: We have two Greek-Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always manages to say something stupid about the coronavirus that makes everyone blush.
Then there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernism and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics but go to services at the Unitarians because it's theologically similar but the members tend to be more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on the street Botanická.
Otherwise, St. Michael's Church on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and they hold a Latin Mass every Sunday at 3 p.m. as they did before Vatican II.
The flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it over from Austria
Břeclav - The flame that was lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him this time either, due to the coronavirus pandemic. In the morning, they received him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
Last year, they also took it over at the border.
The Betlémské světlo is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year, and I look forward to it.
It is an honour for me that I was chosen, said Amálie Budíková, a scout.
Last year, the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge. This year, it took place at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing on the car park.
However, the scouts usually travel to Vienna by train.
The delivery of the flame across the Czech Republic remains unchanged.
The scouts traditionally travel by train to Brno to deliver the Bethlehem light to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, 18 December, the Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent delivery of the light. They will travel on selected express trains and passenger trains.
From them, the light will be taken over by local scouts or volunteers, who will then spread the flame across the Czech Republic and beyond the tracks.
As in previous years, the scouts have to follow the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It is similar to last year.
We advise both the courier teams and the organisers of local events to, of course, wear masks, try to keep a safe distance, have as few of them as possible, don't sing to each other, just behave as safely as possible, described the spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels across Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The aim is to spread the flame together with the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope for believers, a light that overcomes the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts have been spreading it for more than 30 years.
The action is based on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and humanity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come to collect the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I do not have an economic education, so I do not know the basics of economics, which confirm that subsidies are like cancer for the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, the environment (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education will make good use of the money, I just don't understand why the money is put into agriculture, industry and businesses in general.
As mentioned, it produces a useless product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million notices on the corridors saying "xy financed/co-financed by project xy" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not supporting a company that employs x people, this is stunting development where this company is just about hanging on and taking work/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Absolutely, it's terrible.
Even a person who was born in the internet age can fall for a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I believe that internet advertising doesn't work on me, but then I always end up being influenced by it - it's just so well done that you can't resist it.
That is why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament, which are currently calling for an absolute ban on programmatic advertising...
It's all filth, in the words of the classic - I would ban the internet.
I feel that this virus has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe in something that the majority believes in and makes sense, I am not a sheep after all, but rather I will believe in something that is less likely to be true, but it is important that I have my own original opinion about which I will claim that it is critical thinking"
2. "I don't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television has fallen prey to the trend of Christmas movies, with two hundred premiering this year
Los Angeles - Movie theaters, television networks and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries are bucking the trend of Christmas movies this year, premiering a record number of more than 200.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring with audiences in recent years and has significantly increased viewership, so more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times as many Christmas movies have been made as in 2011, and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database, however, only included films with the word Christmas (Christmas) in their title, so there are actually many more Christmas films.
Films traditionally associated with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is mainly associated with fairy tales, while internationally popular films include Home Alone, Love Actually and the classic Christmas story It's a Wonderful Life from 1946.
However, the real boom of Christmas movies started in 2009, when the American cable television channel Hallmark came up with a special film series, the BBC website reminded.
Her Christmas project Countdown to Christmas (Odpočítávání do Vánoc) included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station started to tune its viewers in for Christmas on 22 October and will show a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competitor Lifetime has 35 new holiday movies on its schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms like Netflix are also contributing to the total.
“In this magical time of year, the story doesn't matter as much as the fact that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing,” said Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
For the audience, it's a form of escapism and a way to feel a little bit of calm in the middle of all the holiday craziness and the craziness of the world we've been living in the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, the TV channel Hallmark uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which is successfully resolved and the two people kiss.
It's like that all the time, and as long as all the movies look the same and have the same atmosphere, people will follow one after the other, adds Gray.

Only 19 drivers will take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin has tested positive for Covid-19 and will miss the final race of the season.
Haas will only send one car to the track.
In the final race of the season, he was aiming for a better finish than his 20th place in qualifying.
Russian driver Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for COVID-19.
Only 19 cars will line up on the starting grid, with Mick Schumacher, the teammate of Mazepin, starting from the last place, and Max Verstappen, who will compete with Lewis Hamilton for the title, starting from the first place.
According to the Haas team, Mazepin is doing well and has no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the advice of the relevant public health authorities, with the safety of all parties being the final priority," his representatives said on formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement driver to the race.
The reserve driver would have to go through qualifying or a race in another part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not affected by Covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19 at the start of this season, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: the price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze you!
It's a bit like a portable jewellery shop and the creator has put six months of work and all his savings into it.
I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but I didn't have much experience, sweaters weren't really worn at home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours over the course of half a year working on his creation.
The silk was bought in Italy, the 24-carat gold thread in France, and Swarowski supplied 2,000 decorative crystals.
The silver stars were then decorated with 150 diamonds.
The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater its softness, the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And there's a catch.
I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible, says Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The previous most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost "just" CZK 7.2 million.

You can say that the money from those subsidies could be used better, but that is a completely different discussion.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, surveyors and drone pilots could be deployed before Christmas, with the mission approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and build the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO countries in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Omicron variant spreading in South Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
We currently have another suspected case of this variant in a child from Adamov, in the preparatory class.
There is no evidence of direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov Primary School," said Ciupek.
There were six cases in the region last week.
“We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is being carried out by the National Influenza and Other Respiratory Virus Reference Laboratory at the State Health Institute in Prague,“ the director said.
She added that these are two nurses from the same workplace at the Faculty Hospital in Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils from the Adamov Primary School.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, four have no symptoms.
No one with suspected Omicron travelled abroad
None of those listed traveled abroad, nor did anyone in their families, and there was no contact with anyone who was abroad.
There is no connection between the water polo championship and any of the people mentioned, said Ciupek.

California to restrict gun sales.
He wants to follow Texas' lead in banning abortions.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain firearms in the most populous U.S. state using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected.
People would then be able to sue anyone in California who manufactures or sells assault rifles or homemade firearms.
Newsom's announcement came in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on Friday to leave in place a Texas law banning abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, despite nearly 50 years of precedent establishing a nationwide right to abortion until roughly the 24th week of pregnancy.
The court, however, was not ruling on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Enforcement of the ban was delegated to the public in this case, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it in court.
I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed Texas to continue its ban on most abortion services and largely endorsed Texas's maneuver to shield its law, the California governor said.
If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, "California will use that power to protect human life," Newsom said.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would allow public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
Ghost guns are homemade firearms without serial numbers that can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) in damages and legal fees from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, "ghost gun" components or kits to make them in California.
If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do, the California governor said.
The Associated Press notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge in June blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority ruling warned against expanding the legal mechanism to other American states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas' abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue lawsuits against certain state officials.
Every emergency vaccination has a public trial phase, in which the vaccination schedule and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
Studies on the effects of the fourth dose are already pouring in from Israel.
According to these studies, antibodies increase up to five times in most patients, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Basically, like any other vaccine, it will have its own vaccination schedule, but it is still too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, is expected to hit the market soon, according to the manufacturer's specifications, which promises to be 10 times more effective.

Poland threatens to stop paying into the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting unlawfully if it used its new powers to withhold payments to Poland over the rule-of-law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to draw 36 billion euros from the EU recovery fund for economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withdraw EU funds from countries that violate the rule of law.
Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto in all matters that require unanimity, said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices, Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stops its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified given that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish justice system has undergone during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is setting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing a "political dictate enforced by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on partnership between sovereign states and not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not subject to democratic control.
He said his party would never agree to such concessions to Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
We will never agree to Poland being a colony, he said.
But to get to grips with it... In our Lidl, we have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at other things, I met one yoghurt more than once, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes in the dairy section I gave up and asked.
True, they did have it, but it was in the narrow aisle with all the selected, less common and special cheeses, between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I can avoid it, I won't even set foot in a supermarket, action or inaction, golden shop on the square, maybe they don't have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it's all in order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a holiday.
And I don't care anymore.

Sorry for the rant and have a nice day everyone.
I was beaten with a spoon as a child.
It was never because of grades, it was usually just because I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehaved (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc).
At the same time, I have never been punished without a warning, my mum always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a slap (sometimes even after "catching" the spoon a second time, she just brought it and put it down so that I could see it).
It wasn't until I repeatedly refused to listen that I got a few smacks on the butt (through clothes).
Personally, I believe that physical punishment (in a reasonable manner and degree) is beneficial because children respond to it much more than words.
In my opinion, the most important part is the warning, because it gives the child the choice of whether or not to obey and get punished, or to improve and not get punished.
I usually just needed a warning to start listening.
Defending the system
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document that is sworn to and taught in school from an early age, or rather an agreement that can be changed if necessary - he definitely sided with the first interpretation.
Once we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, we should be more careful with changes.
And imagine: some nations actually like their rules.
Just as the Czechs love dumplings with pork and sauerkraut, Vojtěch Cepl commented at the time.
In recent years, however, lawyers have become increasingly convinced that the Czech Constitution needs to be amended.
It has been tested by situations that its creators (to whom Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not foresee, such as the behaviour of the directly elected president.
However, Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be well thought out.
The institution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to overcoming most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a sort of rulebook for governing, setting boundaries for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't discriminate, at FN Brno several-month-old baby is fighting for its life
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder towards children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been struggling with recently.
We know that children are less endangered and affected than adults, with 2 to 5 percent compared to adults, said Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Paediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at Fakultní nemocnice Brno and Masaryk University Faculty of Medicine.
The course is much simpler, lighter, and often without symptoms.
However, there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we can see especially in recent times," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild support.
It is set in a children's infectious disease clinic.
Seriously ill children with the coronavirus have only recently been admitted to ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-COVID syndromes were continuously admitted to the department throughout the year.
Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, which means pneumonia requiring resuscitation, he said, adding that the disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and several-month-old babies.
There are also children in serious condition in hospitals due to the coronavirus.
At the moment, we have a child of several months and an adolescent, said the head physician.
However, he is happy that so far no child has died of the coronavirus in the Children's Hospital of the FN Brno.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, the psychologist is an integral part of the cooperation in the children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus department.
At the same time, it points out that, just like in adults, vaccination mitigates the course of the disease and reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome in children.
That is why we recommend vaccinating children as well, the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over fences into enclosures).
You are not allowed to ski/ride a bike in the forest outside of marked trails anywhere, unless you have an exception (but of course this is not really enforced outside of national parks).

China projects image of controlled epidemic as authoritarian regime fares better in crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression that the epidemic is under control and that the authoritarian regime is better equipped to deal with the crisis.
China has launched a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was fending off criticism for failing to contain an outbreak that has become a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero new cases.
States including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus, for example, in the worst-hit Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says: hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
My wife is happy because he mows the lawn, washes the car with his trunk, and the children play with him.
It's just great.
If you want, I can sell you a sloth for 5000 CZK.
Friend: OK, I'll give it a go...
After some time, they meet and the one who bought it complains: man, what did you sell it for?
The lawn is trampled, there are giant turds everywhere, the car is wrecked, the kids are scared and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you don't talk about the elephant like that, you won't sell the elephant like that...
The world is ruled by great powers.
Despite the equality of sovereign states, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become a great power if it works on its integration.
So far, it has functioned at the economic and political level (in selected areas), but there is still no military integration.
Personally, I believe that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will work out.
I also thought of that and it is quite possible.
I am not an expert on the Czech language, so I may be nitpicking.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment, "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas in "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
Furthermore, I base this on the fact that the sentence says "all American forces" which includes their weapons, and I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad definition and there is no need to further specify it for American forces.
But again, I'm just nitpicking.
Either way, it's a ridiculous demand

British woman Vicki Holland tortured capuchin monkey Milly
Shocking footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it down and mocked it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
A magistrates court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
Experts in the rehabilitation of monkeys, who are caring for Milly after her abuse, have said they have never seen a monkey so terrified.
Milly spent nearly two years in rehabilitation at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months, at Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of community service, banned from keeping animals for life and ordered to pay court costs of around CZK 12,000.
Leader of the Small Monkeys team, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is doing well but her rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She would crouch and hide from anyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement would cause her to scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she has settled and is happy with her mate, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
Psychological scars from the abuse will stay with her forever, Sawyer added.
Milly's abuse was uncovered after police in Gwent found horrific footage on her phone during a drugs raid at her home.
Milly can be heard swearing on the footage.
In another video, Holland is heard offering the monkey cocaine, saying, "You want some coke?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted possessing cocaine with intent to supply.
Cocaine worth £1,600 was found hidden in Kinder Eggs at her home.
Cox was subsequently sentenced to 30 months in prison and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from the prehistoric three times in a row, when you bravely jump over the whole 20th century?
So you take the same things with you in the first year as in the sixth year?
And the whole thing kills the idea of bifurcation, when nobody, with the exception of a few, cares whether you can do it or understand it.
The main thing is to write a test on 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Run up to people on the street and ask them at random if they know how to find the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone goes through it, and the vast majority don't even flinch and will tell you they don't care.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I'm a big fan of general knowledge and the fact is that people don't want and don't need it.
And at that point it's pointless and you'll never get it into them.
Some of it is learned for the people who will need it.
But, that note that you don't really need all of this while standing at the machine, I meant that quite seriously... ...because you just don't need it.
Moreover, we are slowly approaching the time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
But the price we pay for having barbarians standing guard over our machines is just too high.
If journalists knew how to count, the coronavirus would never have reached these proportions.
Love at first sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea answered on Instagram Stories to the inquisitive fans' questions about why she decided to end all contact with Kadri and even block him on social media.
Kadrim and Andrea clashed from the start of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and her idea was that Andrea would move there, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
However, she resolutely refused.
And it is clear that their relationship did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was your plan! Kadri fumed in response to Andrei's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's alleged honesty did not sit well with his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't say anything about such things, and in my family, we never really talked about them.
I certainly don't want to evoke any sympathy.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and slander someone I love so much, I just can't stand it.
I'm sorry I have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadir for being a character and helping our family when we needed it most, even at such a young age.
All the more so when I have to read such false information, which is probably taken out of context.
I wish everyone knew Kadri the way we do, our close friends and family, she wrote in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people are going to believe what they read, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him more than anything and know the truth and know what really happened, she added vaguely.
The drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao began his robbery spree at a parking lot in a residential neighborhood, where he attempted to break into several cars.
According to available information, he ultimately stole the equivalent of just under 330 Czech crowns from one vehicle.
His next idea was to climb up to the 5th floor and enter the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
Footage from a security camera then shows him walking away from the scene of the crime, eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and he called the police.
Cchaa was subsequently arrested.
The man admitted to having had some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and linked to the pandemic readiness.
Without it, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business
That's not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's local elections
The new councils were elected on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherské Hradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the legally prescribed number or the elected councils have collapsed.
A total of 99 candidates competed for 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of the newly elected councillors is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
The processing of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a relatively difficult but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place there, said Eva Krumpová, Deputy President of the Czech Statistical Office.
She reminded that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel.
In Komňa in Uherské Hradiště, the Association of Independent Candidates won the Saturday elections, gaining 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means that she won two mandates.
The Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of the vote.
The former mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Soukromníci, also got back into the council.
Komňané, independent candidates, gained one seat in the town council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in Pelhřimovsko, the association Pro Rovnou won.
It received 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Association of Lusatia and Svinčice, led by the mayor Jindřich John, won the repeated elections in Lusatia in Mostecko.
It received 56.73 percent of the vote and, like in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
In second place was the Občané pro Budějovice party, which received 43.27 percent of the vote, and will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in Liberec were won by the independent candidates of Naděje pro Novou Ves ahead of ANO.
The association of independent candidates received 59.88 percent of the vote and won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened its position compared to the regular elections in 2018, gaining one mandate and now has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the election results.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all of this.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to argue with.
If not, it's sad.
I am not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
In fact, I quite like a lot of church architecture from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the point).
And I don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I don't like how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it amassed, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, such as the Thirty Years' War
TL;DR: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing in common
The man fell head first from a height of twelve metres.
He survived hitting the concrete.
A man miraculously survived a fall in Ostrava on Sunday night. Rescuers from the Moravian-Silesian Ambulance Service were called to the scene.
An hour after midnight on Saturday, the regional operational centre received an emergency call with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two ambulance crews were immediately sent to the scene - a doctor and a paramedic.
When paramedics arrived at the scene, they discovered that the 27-year-old man had fallen out of the window from a height of around 12 metres and landed head first on the concrete!
Coal caught fire in Vítkovice.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went into action.
When the emergency services arrived, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in a life-threatening condition.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, secured artificial lung ventilation, and after other measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care at the Ostrava trauma centre, informed the spokesman for the Moravian-Silesian Ambulance Service, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more afraid of the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities than I am of the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are at the forefront of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a fantastic night full of interesting results.
Things happened at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to beat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had not been defeated for seven years.
Charles Oliveira made light work of Dustin Poirier to defend his lightweight title.
Kai Kara-France also picked up a win, stopping Cody Garbrandt with a TKO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that nobody expected.
That was provided by the women's bantamweight bout between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the mutual battle as a "dwarf", Nunes having not lost for seven years and sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The start of the match was in line with the paper predictions.
Nunes started the fight aggressively and even knocked her opponent down with a push kick.
Penya, however, was not to be rattled into making any more mistakes, and she unsuccessfully attempted to attack with a wrist lock.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both fighters exchanged a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Peňová also knocked Nunes to the ground, where she began choking her.
She had to give up and shake off the attack.
The American caused a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The main event was a lightweight title fight between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier.
Poirier got off to a good start, but the tide began to turn.
In the second round, Oliveira tried to be more aggressive, trying to submit his opponent with an armbar.
While he didn't do much with it, he then created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on the back foot and peppered him with punches.
He won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to shake it off.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next bout, Sean O'Malley won a convincing victory, knocking Raulian Paiva down with a hard right hook in the first round.
He then knocked him out with a series of well-aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth victory.
Kara-France then defeated Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now she has lost after seven years.
Which knee?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech have only one grammatical gender, so it is easy to determine whether a noun is masculine, feminine or neuter.
There is also a relatively large group of nouns whose gender is not fixed.
Such nouns vary between two genders.
When inflected, they take two endings, and in some cases remain in the uninflected form.
For example, the words "thigh" and "knee" are of both masculine and feminine gender, and are declined according to the model "machine" and "song", respectively.
Another group of nouns have different forms in the first person singular, e.g. "line/lines", "cabbage/cabbages" or "potato/potatoes" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are correct, have the same meaning, and are therefore interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, such as "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumbers" in Moravia, in this case, the Moravian variant is non-standard, just like other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditches", "bun" and "buns" etc.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally uninflected, but have gradually adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is of both masculine and feminine gender, or the word "buffet", which remains in the middle gender, but in the masculine has endings according to the model of "castle".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation at the Greek border?
Tensions are rising on the Greek-Turkish border as more migrants try to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people have headed to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians promise to support Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to embark on this uncertain journey?
And how does the situation look on the ground?
We haven't seen blue skies for three months and we're choking, says Sydney journalist
The devastating wildfires that have ravaged Australia for the past four months have killed nearly three dozen people and millions of animals and destroyed millions of acres of land.
How are the local authorities and the people themselves coping with the disaster?
Could the Morrison government have done more to mitigate the devastating impacts, as critics claim?
And what will countries have to prepare for in terms of climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Sydney-based journalist Ika Detrichová.
False accusations are always rare.
That's why they write about everyone everywhere.
People find it uncomfortable to talk about the extent of sexual violence in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to sweep it under the carpet.
I don't know anyone personally who has been falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I have seen how they are often treated by their surroundings or even the police.
Victims should always be believed.
The trend is that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual assault, but spreading the idea that "a lot of allegations are made up" and that it's a "trend" only helps sexual predators.
Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families have no money to complete them
Construction material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people found themselves in a difficult situation.
It does not have the funds to complete the unfinished family houses and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also rising.
As a result, people do not have enough money to complete already started family houses.
In many cases, banks are refusing to increase mortgages, creating extremely uncomfortable situations.
At best, people move into unfinished and unlicensed homes.
In the worst case scenario, unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay off their mortgages as well as rent," says Štěpán Křeček, an economist at BHS.
We build two to three family houses a year and in fifty percent of cases this has happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to stick to certain things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we are working for free," said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of a construction company.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they thought that building a house would cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," Slivoň added.
Copper, iron and plumbing and heating equipment saw the biggest price increases.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labour.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction-related fields, and the influx of foreign workers has been slowed down by the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuing of building permits is currently more favourable.
In October, building authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 per cent more than last year, Křeček added.
We are doing well and will do even better.
The real visions are missing, says the Czech Radio commentator
Besides the traditional New Year's Eve celebrations, the start of the new year is also traditionally marked by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of the President Miloš Zeman, the speakers of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
As far as I'm concerned, the dissertation is super, I have my own topic, which I chose, I build on my bachelor's degree, I work on it all year round, and then I write the written part in a week or two.
The state exams are completely relaxed here, as long as the person is not a total monkey and there is something left in their head, the commission will not unnecessarily suffocate them on theory.
I, for example, studied for a week before the state exams, and when I was at the end of my tether, the examination committee always tried to guide me to some logical derivation, which I immediately got right.
As for those projects, I know people who hire someone to do the semester-long project for them (we've done this a lot, it's really helpful, you learn a lot).
I think it's great when at the end of the course there is an exam, in which the knowledge gained during the project is reflected, not just the defence.
Do not bombard the embassy with emails and phone calls and do not send any packages.
You'll be just like them.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would be risking a lot, so maybe they have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can also put a similar statue of Putin next to the bear Pú.
Perhaps we should give it to Xi Jinping on the backside or something like that.
I agree, even though Instagram is throwing spanners in the works for artists.
If you don't post stories every day and at least one new picture every other day, your reach will drop to an absolute minimum.
Furthermore, they keep changing what is more important, whether it is a like, a comment or a save.
I've been really frustrated lately, so I might have to resort to TikTok, where a lot of artists in my field are having success and people can't get enough of it.
In the end, I might even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that didn't suck the creativity and energy out of artists
Donbas People's Republic statement
The Union - yes, the break-up - no, say the opponents of the break-up of the USSR on the photo.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
On December 8, 1991, in the Bialowieza Forest, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the benevolent indifference of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With a stroke of a pen, they "cancelled" a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russians found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has fallen by ten to eleven million.
Even without the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars combined!
Earlier, the same people who, in one session in the Bialowieza Forest, destroyed what had been built up over the past 70 years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialisation, slowed down agriculture, detached fourteen republics from the largest world power, which were previously economically connected in a single mechanism.
If we look deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the abandonment of the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as "vacuum of power".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and abandoned was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken by events from the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover does not necessarily correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I'll buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I do not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce its price to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the change in the price of the meat makes it a burden for my digestive system?
Or I can wait until Thursday and the meat will be 69 CZK/kg, which is 120 CZK cheaper than what I bought on Monday and left in my refrigerator for 3 days?
I will answer myself - by nothing.
These jokes about the fact that if something is cheap, it must be bad, spoiled or of poor quality are really retarded, to be honest ;-)
I recently went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass a young lady was handing out some kind of brochure, I always take things like that to help the casual workers, they can't just throw them away...
No, the pamphlet was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I guessed it was some kind of propaganda.
After reading it, I found out who published it and it turned out to be Scientology.
No, he was a good guy, full of completely unnecessary lessons, like that I should wash and not be a bitch.
It's a waste of paper, forests would not have to be cut down for this.
Something similar happened with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with that person because you love them, without realising how bad the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself because I went out with a friend she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started crying and on her knees she begged me not to leave.
Then she started physically blocking the doors.
Approximately a year ago, it was a great relationship, but then another half a year passed and she started to get on my nerves.
I then ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up with her and lying to her that we could talk about it next week to calm her down and so that she wouldn't go on another rampage.
Such a person will suck out your feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Keep your distance
When insurance companies are raking it in by buying up clouds of tests and hunting down the positives who would not know about the terrible disease without the test.
The only thing we are achieving is complicating the lives of companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator got five days of house arrest.
In the west, they have already stopped this nonsense and recognised that it is not worth worrying about a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still has to steal something and boost his ego by inventing buzzwords.
I see that the old scam is back.
After several years of decline and suppression of this nefarious business, MLM recruitment is once again on the rise.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a first-year student at university), the initial promises of training products and business skills quickly turned into "it doesn't matter to you, just get people".
Honestly, I was interested in the products I was selling because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about scaring and persuading people.
When the first earned money came, a person quickly realized that if he wanted to earn, he had to make a few sure products every month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only ways to make money, so you felt like a door-to-door pot salesman.
What I can say, however, is that it was a valuable experience, and I learned that one should not jump on every piece of information.
At the same time, I would not lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even helpful to others, but they certainly won't be bragging about expensive consumer goods or "fat" bank accounts.
In the corporate world where I work, I haven't experienced much of that.
HR is calm, managers are managing their managers, and they're not sticking their noses into anything.
Regular assessment does, in fact, take place, in the form in which it takes place in our country (set yourself some goals for the next year, and at the end of the year we'll look at what worked and what didn't). It's more of a self-assessment, rather than being assessed by someone according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we're also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more corporate.
Sometimes it feels like we're a quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works as long as the results are there.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
British police have been searching for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman for almost ten days without success.
On Sunday, December 12, Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that the woman from Uherskohradištska had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that the body of the missing Czech citizen has been found.
The cause of death is under investigation.
Out of respect for the family, we will not be releasing any further information.
Sincere condolences, Kulhánek wrote on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on 28 November on a bus on her way home from work. She was going to withdraw money from an ATM before getting on the bus.
Her disappearance was reported by her work colleagues five days later.
Following this, the London police started looking for her, and Interpol listed her as a missing person worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police have already arrested one man in connection with this.
She did not say what role he played in the case or what he is suspected of.
Four municipalities got new councils at the end of the year
On Saturday, 11 December, new councils were elected in Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Liberecko and Rovná in Pelhřimovsko.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the legally prescribed number or the elected councils have collapsed.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates competed for 28 mandates.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the councils of the four mentioned municipalities.
A total of 36 women and 63 men competed for 28 seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a relatively difficult but successful year.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and above all very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place there.
We had to work in more difficult epidemiological conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personnel, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Deputy President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last precinct was called at 3:49 a.m. on Sunday, December 12.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will consider the results of the vote and, if approved, they will be published in the Official Gazette.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have quite a dangerous infectious disease, but it went smoothly.
I am still struggling to come to terms with the fact that a large part of the population, at all levels, is behaving so idiotically.
I am most looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not assholes.
He would be stripped of the presidency and disqualified from holding it again.
However, the chances of this actually happening are very small.
Moreover, I am not sure whether the declassification of the file could be considered treason.
High treason is such an act that endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic is affecting people's sex lives: Number of under-35s going a year without sex rises
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
According to the Daily Mail's website, this mainly concerns religious people.
The survey found that the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sex has risen from eight per cent to 21 per cent between 2008 and 2021.
The number of women aged 18 to 35 who said they had not had sex in the past year is at an all-time high.
The decline in the number of sexually active individuals is also influenced by other factors, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment.
However, the presence of the media, social networks or video games could also have contributed to this. For young people, sex is becoming less and less of a priority.
Since 2010, the share of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they did not have sex in the past year has grown rapidly, said Lyman Stone, a researcher at the IFS.
People in marriages are more sexually active, with just 5% of those surveyed in 2021 saying they had gone a year without sex.
Among the unmarried, it was 29 percent. Stone added that marriages under age 35 are only a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also due to the fear of premarital sex and the religious background.
While married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and cohabiting people under 35 is still falling.
Young people are divided on the issue of premarital sex, with about 30% thinking it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
While free-living individuals in this age group are a minority, their behavior is driving this trend," Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate among unmarried people younger than 35 who attend religious services more than once a month has increased from 20 percent to nearly 60 percent.
Among the "less religious," the trend rose from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
Other factors contributing to the decline in sexual activity include less social interaction and especially less social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people who are unemployed or have lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which may reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, which is replacing this need.
This trend took hold especially during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole point of vaccinating against Covid is whether a society should force part of the population to do something they don't want to do, but which might save their lives.
It's a tough question, and one that I'm personally most interested in from the perspective of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether, if we do not order them to do it and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be held responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know what he was doing, we didn't explain it well enough to him, he heard some misinformation, and in the end he didn't get vaccinated and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can be held responsible for the death of a stubborn opponent of vaccinations, who is standing here next to the SPD and the KSČ, shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be inferred that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will be able to blame themselves.
Czechia without snow.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic in recent years.
Operators of ski resorts cannot do without artificial snow, the weather is also complicating the preparations for the cross-country skiing Jizerská 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about a prankster.
Once in middle school, our teacher took us all the way across town to the boat dock so we could go boating on the river.
On the way there, we walked down a fairly wide street and who did we see in the middle of it - Hare Krišna followers.
Of course, they came down on us.
Fortunately, I managed to escape, but one of my friends got into an argument.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what she had told them.
They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I don't have a soul," she replied.
We all laughed all the way to the boathouse, including the teacher.
We are spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was welcomed with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
We are opening a new chapter in our relations, said Morawiecki at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the worrying movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border is worth resolving through diplomatic negotiations, even within the "Normandy Group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, as we record a hundred attempts to (illegally) cross the border every night.
I spoke to the Chancellor about further sanctions to finally make the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, assured that Warsaw can count on German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of Lukashenko's regime with refugees.
Drunk Polish nun caused crash, tried to cover it up
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but it was driven by another nun, who tried to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driving licence for failing to give way and leaving the scene of an accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that she hit another nun, who asked her for help.
The police then came for Celestina.
They subjected her to a breathalyser test and, after discovering that she had more than two promilles of alcohol in her blood, they immediately confiscated her driving licence.
At the same time, they informed her that she would have to account for her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not keep an eye on his film.
The Czech creators of family comedies looked to American stories about beloved pets.
However, they forgot one important thing: the laws of filmmaking.
After the kitschy film F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people to live, another film is now vying for the audience's emotions in cinemas.
Juraj Šajmovič Jr., the scriptwriter and director in one person, loosely follows his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
Hugo, the talking hedgehog, is back, along with some familiar characters.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a dying pension in the Šumava mountains, start inviting dog owners, Julie's father with his partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenager who is experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer) struggled with the narrative in their previous dog film, but at least children and the dog were amusing.
This time, the creative duo has written an even weaker script that elicits a mixture of awe and embarrassment.
Let's recap.
Julie, despite being a scientist, falls prey to superstitious nonsense and, if the stars are right, will copulate with her forest engineer Ivan wherever the coordinates dictate - on the bonnet of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing tour with a local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie), who falls into a coma, and the family takes her to the hospital, where a miraculous healing process can take place with the help of a dog.
Nothing against the healing power of nature and the strength of beloved animals.
Their owners know why they have them.
However, the viewer is amazed at the amount of content jumble full of unbelievable situations and figures that was needed to convey this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a dog show, the Shumava charlatan, the police coming to a tip-off to look for "drugs" and discussing the fertilising power of bone meal - and, of course, the over-indulged family staying in the pension.
When the heroine wakes up from a coma and immediately sits at the family table, made up and smoking a cigar, demanding her father's whisky and chips as a recovered vegetarian, it's hard not to laugh.
To top it off, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks the basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build the main situations, the feeling for the characters and the point, and the directorial guidance.
The performances are uneven, the editing is clumsy and the overall impression is sloppy.
While Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their parties together, they have little to play for.
The only redeeming feature of the film are the poetic shots of the Šumava nature by the cameraman Vladimír Holomek and the pair of ermines.
It's not enough to sketch out a few characters, a flimsy plot, and dog puns, let alone the more folksy vulgarities the characters utter.
Membership in the Dachshund Breeders' Club is not an argument either - as in the case of the producer.
Good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between humans and dogs are not enough, if you want to tell a believable story.
This did not work out in this case.
There's a bit too much erotica and too little feeling for the genre in this family film.
Even as an advertisement for canisterapy, this amateurish piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from people like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see that you don't know your arse from your elbow, but that is only because you have never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if the customer does not want it, the answer will always be no.
If you had listened to those kids all the time, you might have changed your mind.
It is work like any other, in this case a part-time job.
The Middle East is experiencing unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
The "almost complete absence of rainfall in November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of its long-term average rainfall in November.
This week's two-day downpour was an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas atmosphere, said Nazareth resident Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, is sporadic and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rain.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, is full to the brim this spring, thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has fallen.
Hydrologists have been warning about drought for a long time.
Depending on global warming and climate change, "there may be less rainfall," Uri Schor, spokesman for Israel's Water Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or recycling wastewater.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are in a worse position.
More tanker trucks are seen on the streets of Amman, the capital of Jordan.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
This year, orders have risen by 70 to 80 per cent compared to the previous two years, reported tanker truck driver Imád Sulejman in September.
Farmers and security forces clashed in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The bed of the local river was completely dry.
The region has experienced its driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military strike against Iran
Israel's defense minister said talks in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and that he informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Defense Minister Benny Gantz said Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of striking Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who is in the United States, is trying to convince Americans to ratchet up pressure on Iran while also informing Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I flirted with the lady a bit and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicion of a pyramid scheme was justified.
Because I really don't like scammers, I kept pestering the girl with doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked her and left.
Tell me I'm wrong, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers hit the slopes at the weekend, with plenty of snow and good weather
The mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of skiing enthusiasts this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have opened.
The skiers were not deterred by the obligation to show a covid certificate at the lifts.
While lift operators are not complaining about a lack of customers, some ski rental outlets are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people went hiking and skiing in the Liberec region over the weekend.
The weather was on the skiers' side today, with sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
We are satisfied, the opening weekend really went well, from the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the mountain, said the director of the Ještěd Sport Areal Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went skiing for the first time this season in the Jeseník Mountains.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov or the centre in Branná in Šumperk were open.
Weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people visiting on Saturday and Sunday.
The conditions are superb.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so it was perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branná.
Operators of ski resorts can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from the coronavirus infection.
According to René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre, people are generally prepared for this and are showing the necessary documents.
We only had a few incidents," he added.
Some ski rental and sales outlets report lower demand than before the pandemic.
Thankfully, there is interest in ski hire.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
A larger influx is expected during skiing courses.
The director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, David Šinták, also feels that there is less interest in renting ski equipment due to the coronavirus.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost fully booked.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are at about 50 percent, said Šinták to ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazy during the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental agency in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is experiencing high demand.
They started renting out skis there last week, and interested parties now have to book them in advance.
“We start renting out cross-country skis this weekend, but people have been calling in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the area.
According to her, the interest in ski school is also comparable to the pre-epidemic period.
If we want successful and wealthy people not to leave the country, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life here as they do abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist healthcare, where it is often difficult to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people are leaving the country without any property.
The owner of the company is not going to leave the country just like that.
I agree with the rest.
If these people will not be able to live well in the Czech Republic and if these people will not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will not live here.
Emigration from Hungary started when one day Orbán won, he governed for a year and suddenly emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position.
Another question is the elections.
If it's going to be bad here, then a traditional V4 madman could win.
The young and educated will leave, leaving behind his supporters and those whose wealth cannot fit into a plane.
Terrifying photo!
Langmajer in blood due to a bet on a beer?
While in the Czech Republic autumn was in full swing, the crew of the film Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a genuine injury, or is it for show?
The London police are still looking for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
The disappearance of Petra is completely out of character for her and we are growing increasingly concerned for her welfare," said Lucy O'Connor, of Lambeth police, where Srncova worked.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work around 7.45pm on Sunday 28 November and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant nurse" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
We have grave concerns for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
Anyone with any information that could help find her is urged to contact police.
Harriet Harman, an MP, has also called on the public to cooperate with the investigation.
She's been missing for a few days now, she's only 32, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously distraught," the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the Metropolitan Police.
I feel like we all have a special responsibility to try to find her, because she was away from her home country, away from her family, working here for our health care," Harman said.
Police have previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, the BBC news website reports that the police have not released any information about the man's identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
I do not underestimate Ukraine either.
This is not "huge numbers", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of an invasion and are starting to get tired of our involvement.
I quoted up there.
I don't know where he got the idea that Russia wants war.
War is hell and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison to 38 is so off-base in so many ways that I don't even know where to begin.
I can already compare this with the First Punic War and the annexation of Sicily: D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia annexes those ridiculous republics.
That's all there is to it, and that's how the "concentration" at the border makes sense.
After all, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables come into force in Prague on Sunday, affecting mainly suburban trains
Passengers in the Prague integrated transport system (PID) can look forward to a number of changes from Sunday.
New lines have been created, some have changed their routes, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is now joining the integrated system.
From Sunday, fast trains from České Budějovice will stop at the Zahradní Město station in the capital.
In suburban rail transport, S7 trains will run, which pass through the Prague main railway station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station will now be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will be expanded to other areas.
Buses will also go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladoboleslavsko region, including lines extending into the Liberecký and Královéhradecký regions, will be included.
During the integration, 77 lines will be abolished, 37 new ones will be introduced and the operation of 12 existing ones will be changed.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Zličín in Prague and go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník has also been established, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
The connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at weekends, with the introduction of express line 404.
Newly included in the PID system are lines 400 and 410 going to the Liberec Region.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
The backbone line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected services continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Line 410 runs through Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimoň and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, the operation of a number of local tracks in the Central Bohemian Region has been cancelled or limited, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, there are long-term restrictions on the tracks from Prague to Beroun, Prague to Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín.
Passengers can also expect changes at other locations.
Buses are replacing some of the cancelled railway lines or expanding the section of line 420 from Dobříš with a connection to Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed, and the routes of some buses on the border of the Central Bohemian Region and Hořovicko in the Plzeň Region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack/lunch from the supermarket for the office
Hi, I work 9-5 with a 30-minute lunch break and my only option for food is to go across the road to Billy or a bit further to Lidl.
Because I have no movement, after work I do not have the strength to exercise, so I have to eat as healthily and dietarily as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I can only buy pizza dough and for a snack yoghurt and an apple.
Question: what healthy food that doesn't need to be cooked would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a metre of snow like you do, unfortunately.
And it's not the trees you have to see.
Only the tip of the tree is visible under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying it's the only reason we're not allowed to go off-piste, but it is one of them.
Dara's admission about her relationship with Nedved: I wasn't looking forward to this
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing but revelations about the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, and the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to fans explaining why she kept her love a secret for so long.
I allow myself to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who does not know that Dara has caught a bear, that is, pardon, Nedvěd, Dara Rolins jokes, who is madly in love with the most successful Czech football player.
However, he claims that he was the one who dumped her, not the other way around.
Three days are in the spotlight, and while they're used to public interest, they don't enjoy it.
And here it is.
The thing we were both dreading, but knew was inevitable, continues the singer.
I don't know who is worse off.
Whether it's the ones who don't care at all and it pops up on them even from a can, or us, whose lives are dissected in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear the other's opinion on whether or not you're compatible with your husband or wife, or if you insisted on everyone knowing in detail the list of your ex-partners and being aware of the list of your mistakes and failures.
That's what you want, Dara.
The couple met in Italy, where Rolins was preparing her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been the vice-president of the football club Juventus for a long time.
They only came clean now, because they were waiting for the completion of Nedvěd's divorce.
He has been separated from his wife Ivana for three years, but they have only been legally divorced for three weeks.
Anyway, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
This is why I love my new man and I stand by him, both in good times and bad, concluded Rolins.
Hi, other commenters have probably already said it, but I just want to confirm that the halls are great to start with, my fellow students usually get to know each other and become friends during the first semester or two, and then they find accommodation together, which I think is the best option, because you know who you will be living with.
Most apartments are not advertised very far in advance, so there is not much available now, but it is worth taking a look.
Otherwise, you should definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc. are not a good address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit like a ghetto.
On the other hand, Veveří district is very student-friendly, Královo pole is nice in that direction, and it's close to most VUT faculties (I don't know which one you're going to).
I've never had to look for a flat, but I'm a native Brno resident, so if you need any information about Brno, I can help you.
That's an example of completely normal thinking.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland have decided to do, it's actually okay that the state doesn't sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it themselves, or they follow the state curriculum and the state pays for it.
Surely we cannot allow a private actor to take over a part of the education system just because they add a few crowns to the state contribution and can then teach whatever they want in schools.
Such a statement loses some of its weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier expressed himself in this way about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against abortion is the same as a vote against a statue in the square?
I would consult with the person who gave you the job directly.
Otherwise, I have already experienced that (and this also applies to long-term professionals) that they either guess or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and in the note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it's quite readable, so I wouldn't really recommend it.
Personally, I would have dealt with this in a note depending on what program you are using.
If you want to be a conscientious and diligent student, you can look into some sign language databases and find the nearest one.
But because it looks like you're drawing from a book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol that fits what is physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it rather the Odryan Empire (kingdom) than the Odryan Kingdom?
PSS: Someone's already beaten you to it.
Check out that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
This is much worse than the fact that they will have interpreters.
The idea that they would approve something because nobody understood some text is laughable.
All important approved documents are scrutinized word for word, and for that, basic knowledge of English is not enough, that is the job of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions. English is more useful to politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, with the English language, it's quite interesting after Brexit.
I don't understand the hate for Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and it's all good.
How many times have I come home from work at 10pm and never had a problem?
Only someone who has hardly ever set foot there can say that it is a ghetto.
Yes, most of Brno's Romani population lives there, but the only thing they do is obstruct the pavement and park where they shouldn't. It's definitely not the case that I'm afraid to go out at night.
So if you're looking for reasonably priced accommodation with good access to the centre, I'd say go for it.
Many apartments have been newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda or Gelová as a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen Dáda's wreath and I'm sure that Lucie has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, thus confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda remained alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met up with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we still talked to each other, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy presents throughout the year and I will definitely buy something for Dáda and Luci. Perhaps a perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the music video premiere at Richman's club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to talk to, says Slováček, who was happy to meet Adrianu, the wife of Ludek Sobota, or the singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And are we Iceland, that we can afford not to have an army and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will stand up for us and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, can you explain that to me?
I do not know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals during a crisis.
There are too few police officers and they can't afford it, so the firefighters and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at this level.
The fact that our army is capable of defending just Ostrava goes against the previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst period of drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the water has decreased in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas, and there has also been less rainfall in places where there was no shortage of water.
The drought affecting much of central Europe is caused by climate change.
However, the effects are exacerbated by the way we manage the soil.
What to do in case of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it's going to be like that, I can barely stay on my skates on the ice, I don't know what it's like to play hockey, and the tactics (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are all over the place.
Whether you're the hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Llama China", losing by two goals when you don't have to win the game is different than when it's tied.
But anyway, what I hear from the Czech commentators who point out what the referees notice and don't notice, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And in my opinion, if it had been the other way round, it would have been the same as always, and that the Czech Republic has lost against Russia more often than it has won, it would have been the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5,766 people are hospitalised.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, and another 74.
In the Czech Republic, the number of confirmed cases in the last 14 days is 1,967 per 100,000, and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections were registered.
It is the lowest daily figure since October 13.
The total number of registered cases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest since the end of October.
The UK is facing an "inevitable" wave of infections caused by the Omicron variant, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK Health Security Agency, said on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Omicron-infected people are already being hospitalised in Britain and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson probably broke the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
One of Mr Johnson's ministers defended the quiz as having taken place "virtually" on a computer.
But it was attended by groups of staff gathered around computers in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is mounting on Johnson to step down as prime minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous raves despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have made a joke of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial broadcaster ITV for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide majority in a general election.
This morning the Conservatives are talking about removing him from the post of Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events have developed.
Want to turn it around and save your skin?
Hungary is gearing up for spring elections that could end Viktor Orban's 12-year rule.
These will be elections of European significance.
How much can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, as they were not in the last two elections under Orbán.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit itself, and does other smaller or larger tricks.
The last one states that everyone can choose where they want to live in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to bus voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and where the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is completely different.
In the past, the question was not whether Fidesz would win, but by how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will go to the united opposition.
This is a big change for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they play even harder to keep their power?
Yes, we have some hints that they're willing to go beyond what they've done so far.
Recently, a recording leaked to the independent media of the Speaker of the Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, where he tells the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Those are the hints of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that is one of the novelties.
It all starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, the last time when I was 14, my mum doesn't have a lot of patience, neither do I, my dad has for a long time, but then he explodes (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I used to get very angry, to the extent that I would lie on the floor in convulsions and turn blue, and they had to take me under the shower twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they scolded me, sometimes it was more that they didn't know what to do.
Definitely, I also have a tendency to solve things violently, I used to fight a lot when I was little, now I at least hit something, and when I was younger, I used to hit my parents on the hand, for example (so that I didn't get a beating), so nothing extreme, but I always have this urge.
I'm not sure to what extent this is down to my temperament, but I'm sure my upbringing has played a part.
I am afraid that I will also lose my patience with my children and deal with it in the same way.
I think that beating children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at a time when it wasn't "educational" but out of frustration, on the other hand, every parent makes mistakes, so I don't hold it against them.
It doesn't bother me, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call Kundami those who create laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I would like to know if you are afraid of losing your income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and that you will be able to pay off your mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will the trial of the murderers of the journalist Kuciak take Slovakia?
In Slovakia, the main trial in the case of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová has begun.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner has changed Slovakia.
It stirred up civil society, but it also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočner and his links to the Slovak political and judicial elite.
How significant will the process be for Slovakia?
The media are to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition by the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they were duped and the company got away with it.
Before half a year ago, people were dying of Covid on Czech television.
Another government is ending and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a repository is nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and approval of a deep geological repository for high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The government's legislative council has suspended consideration of the proposal, which the Ministry of Industry and Trade has presented to the government after years of delays.
Its content, however, is in serious conflict not only with the Platform against deep geological storage, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The self-governing bodies are expecting a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers on the storage site, as promised to the mayors since 2011, when the work on this legislation began, and which is also required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law proposed by Minister Karel Havlíček, which Platform has at its disposal, is criticised by the municipalities, in particular, for: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the location of the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if communities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a particular location.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Storage Facility Authority to obtain the consent of the affected municipalities before starting a specific procedure.
The proposed draft of the spatial plan almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens of the municipalities little more than mere statistics in the permit proceedings.
The draft omits the systemic setting of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching for and selecting a site for a repository, its approval and operation.
According to today's legal norms, representatives of municipalities do not have many opportunities to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for a repository.
Only in certain permit proceedings can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or minister whose interest it is to issue the permit.
A possible lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on exploration or construction work.
The co-determination of local authorities, which the Platform is calling for, is a principle that is commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in authorising storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is also another failure of state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was signed by SÚRAO and is based on contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total sum for these works, according to the contract register, is nearly 4 million Czech crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of Cejle, a spokesperson for the Platform Against Deep Geological Repository for Highly Radioactive Waste, said: "After the ministers of industry, who only postponed the settlement of the position of self-governing bodies vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors, we are expecting a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Association of Towns and Communes, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a major project in a similar way to the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Platform Against Deep Geological Disposal brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to advocate for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep geological disposal.
The platform also advocates that the decision on the choice of location for possible storage should be subject to the prior consent of the affected communities.
John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he didn't feel the need to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually scared by doctors.
They told him he would die if he didn't lose weight.
And it worked.
Goodman has shed 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kilograms, The Sun reports.
He showed off his new look at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
Roseanne's Fat Sidekick Is a Completely Different Person!
John joked that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body was breaking furniture.
I put everything in my mouth," the actor told AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm at an age where I can't afford to sit still, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, for example, a formal text or a university text, I would probably try to describe or explain the boss.
And there are more boss types.
For example, a game like Dark Souls has several bosses, right? So, "boss" is something like the ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that are not required to be defeated in order to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are there, but the player doesn't fight them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called bosses?
And then there are mini bosses.
It's hard to translate the word "boss" in a one-word phrase, Czech and other languages don't really have a word for it (interesting is Catalan, which translates "boss" as the final enemy).
It's simply a major part of the story or game in general, a computer-controlled opponent that's tougher than all the ones that came before it, and tasked with completing some level or objective.
The whole world is looking for Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for Petra Srncová since 3 December.
The Czech police also got involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko has been missing since 7 December.
Interpol also helps the British police.
Her colleagues last saw Petra Srncová on 28 November.
The British police have been looking for her since 3 December.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
The whole world is looking for Petra.
The Czech police cooperate closely with the British police, confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
We share information on the case, she added.
The search for Petra has also appeared on the police website.
He said she is 168 centimetres tall, slim and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same colour.
It should come from Uherskohradišťsko.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her
The local MP Harriet Harman has also joined the search for Petra.
She took part in putting up posters with Petra's face.
We have huge concerns," she said at a Saturday news conference.
British police have arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
However, it is not clear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czechia is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight dip in attack campaigns, last month saw a surge in attacks as the end of the year approaches.
The Agent Tesla campaign peaked on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is designed to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month's dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its name, this time it was labelled as "11.2021...exe", said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the end of August and the beginning of September, and with the approach of the holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the spyware Formbook was also active.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security specialists captured more global campaigns in November.
Compared to Formbook's October data, it weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks were continuous throughout the month, with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
The formbook most commonly contained an attachment with the extension .exe, named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the term receipt is still used.
The attachment in Czech may be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decline and a slowdown in the activity of the Fareit programme, which was responsible for 1.6 per cent of attacks, and had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for several months.

The parade in Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the embankment and according to my experience, I estimate that there were around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
To the parade of about four thousand demonstrators spontaneously join an unprecedented number of passers-by.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led to them finding common ground.
Anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and co. alone would not have been able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The activities of the Chcípl pes association remind me of the Million Moments for Democracy movement in reverse.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say which movement would emerge from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the flow of money, but also on whether Pfizer's three-dose vaccine becomes a four- or five-dose vaccine.
It will definitely not be a left-wing or centrist movement. Bet on it.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine because it is clear that we will have to be re-vaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant action of scientists, of which humanity is rightly proud.
Out with the old, in with the new: Bulgaria gets a new PM promising change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption party There Is Such a People, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
He has already managed to put together a broad coalition government, which will take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the pressure of anti-corruption protests.
Victorious parties pledging to fight corruption and abuse of power failed to agree, triggering two early elections.

The secretly filmed footage has become a global hit.
Fears for the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been missing for several days, grew in Britain over the weekend.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, the former employer of the hospital worker and the MP representing the London constituency where she lived are also calling.
The disappearance of Petra is completely out of character for her and we are growing increasingly concerned for her welfare," said Lucy O'Connor, of Lambeth police, where Srncova worked.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work around 7.45pm on Sunday 28 November and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant nurse" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
We have grave concerns for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
Anyone with any information that could help find her is urged to contact police.
The amateur painter of children's bedrooms from Šumperk, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also the regional Pirate councillor) was reported anonymously for violating copyrights with her paintings.
The court, however, recognised that Krteček paintings in Šumperk bedrooms do not violate the law.
For a month, there was a hole in the road in Ústí nad Labem in the form of a channel without a cover.
It was life or death.
The town hall referred the complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which owns the road, and since it did not respond, the hole remained.
In the end, the authorities clarified the responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, ŘSD "began to deal with the situation intensively".
