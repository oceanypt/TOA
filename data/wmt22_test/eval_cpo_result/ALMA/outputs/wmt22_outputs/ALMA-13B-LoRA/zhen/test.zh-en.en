Zhejiang University Academic Conference: Students Sing the Lead Role, Research Results Make People's Minds Open - Xinhuanet
Blowing air to wash hands, judging diseases by breathing, and accurately searching for the source of smog. Yesterday evening, a series of academic achievements were awarded at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers environmental, mechanical, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities education and other fields. Students have created many high-end inventions with practical value from a curious idea, and some of the projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: your home doctor
Zhang Di-ming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biological sensor on a smartphone, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
“All you need to do is take a deep breath, and this device can preliminarily detect your health status from the composition of the breath you exhale. ”
Zhang Di-ming said that this sensor is connected to a smartphone, and the health report will appear on the phone after exhaling the gas.
Smart bracelets that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biological sensor uses the new material graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the state of health.
Smart surgical lamps: doctors' high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th Swiss International Invention Exhibition in Geneva this year.
Zhulin Jing and Xin Junfei's team of the Graduate School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened a new path in the defects of traditional surgical lamps, and invented the intelligent LED surgical lamp.
“Many early detection and removal of diseases are related to the light used by doctors in the operating room. "
For example, in the early detection of cancer, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time, the cancer cells will continue to spread.
The smart surgical lamp has four lamps, which can adjust the spectrum to enhance the contrast of different tissues under light.
During the surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and zero-shadow rate of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been used in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, but Li Qichang and his classmates invented an "air washing device".
As soon as we step onto the device's sink, our weight can compress the air out.
It's like an air pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the water tap and mixes with the water.
This way, we can wash our hands clean! "
Colour reaction and bacteria residue tests prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of common washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness and save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among the world's top universities and won the only gold award.
Please arrange to reimburse me as soon as possible, thank you.

A very meaningful certificate - first aid certificate
This is one of the most important skill certificates besides my driving license!
For the record, emergency measures are actually emergency rescue measures, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that it takes some time for an ambulance to arrive after an accident, and this is the critical time.
That's when you need emergency care.
If I really have a heart attack, a stroke, respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
So how important it is for people around you to know first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of standing still and doing nothing, which makes us feel so helpless.
In China, we have 300,000 accidental deaths every year, and the most dangerous is called cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the national average is 15%.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 70 to 80 percent can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1 percent."
This is what the founder of the First Reaction said.
If someone has a heart attack and stops breathing and has no heartbeat, CPR is not going to help.
Artificial respiration and chest compression are the only way to save a person.
I found that we still have very few people who have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react quickly when we encounter emergencies.
It might even save someone's life!
You can sign up for the First Aid Certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students get a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before I am 25 years old. Adding the first aid certificate to the list of goals was a few months ago, but I really did it!
Then I will go to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that you need a first aid certificate to take this certificate. In fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#

Because it was valid when I entered the code before
First of all, I personally think that Four Seas is a bad film in all aspects.
But you can't say that this film is not a highlight, at least the music is good.
There are many kinds of bad movies. Those that make you fall asleep in the theater are one kind, and those that make you angry after watching them are another. Four Seas is like a monkey in Emei Mountain. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really a genius.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creature from a Cormac McCarthy novel, incomprehensible and full of holes like the windbreaker on Little Big Man.
Even after you've seen it, you'll wonder if there's some directorial subtext, but when you think about it, it's just a big pile of shit.
I'll start with some of the more difficult-to-understand plot points.
The male protagonist should live in a small island in the south, and depend on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish that she wanted to see snow, and the plot was arranged so that a big uncle in the neighborhood drove a small bread car to take her to Northeast China to see snow.
Old people in their 80s and 90s sitting in a bread truck from the south to the northeast to see snow?
He and his dad are very relaxed about it.
Then the old man disappeared.
How did the female lead's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the gangsters on the island easily block a mountain road?
Then a truck loaded with steel rods stopped in the middle of the road, and the driver was nowhere to be found.
The props are too obvious.
Why would a credit-challenged, suspected lawbreaker become a deputy sheriff?
Why don't people report high-interest loans? In the movie, the police even asked whether there were any difficulties.
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use the room card to open the door in the hotel, and then arrange to find the hotel boss and sleep outside the room door?
This nonsensical plot pervades the entire film, so much so that when I think back on it, it makes me cringe.
Besides the plot, what's worse is the theme of the film, or rather, this film has no theme at all, it's just a patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to shoot a comedy film. 20 minutes later, you will guess that it may be an inspirational film. Halfway through the film, you will think that it may be a drama film that wants to reflect the difficulties of small town youth. After watching the film, you will not know what you have watched at all, and you will have deep doubts about yourself. Why do you have to go to the cinema to watch the film during the Spring Festival?
For most people, they are also very familiar with the routines of all kinds of movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, you need to inspire + comedy, and then tell the audience how a novice with talent will step by step towards success.
If you want to make a romantic film, then you should talk about the love-hate relationship between the motorcycle-riding town youth and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot contradict the normal world.
for example, Yin Zheng's new motorcycle has just been burned, and then the character can still sing), you can't go to open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand.
As for the female lead, although she is not mentally retarded, she behaves like a 5-year-old child in some aspects. I don't know whether this is because of her acting skills or the director's requirements.
There is another thing that I can't understand, why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes in his own movies?
Such a film arrangement in the Spring Festival slot, is it to give the audience trouble?

Chongqing Vocational Schools Pilot Modern Apprenticeship System - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Bureau that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent cultivation model in 60 vocational schools, and the students accepted for pilot cultivation will simultaneously hold the status of apprentices. After enrollment, they will be pre-hired by the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission required that the enrollment and recruitment procedures of vocational schools should be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and employees of enterprises should be clarified. According to the principle of mutual selection, apprentices, vocational schools, and enterprises should sign a three-party agreement. For apprentices who have not reached the age of 18 by the age of 16, a four-party agreement should be signed by apprentices, guardians, vocational schools, and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and rights and interests protection of apprentices in on-the-job training.
encourage pilot schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship form and jointly carry out pre-employment training and job transfer training with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot schools should reform the mode of talent cultivation.
The school and the enterprise jointly designed the talent training plan, jointly formulated the professional teaching standards, course standards, position standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program has a training period of one pilot period, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan. The on-the-job training is generally 6 months.
In the enterprise practice, the enterprise team management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that the students are proficient in the skills required for each rotational training post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has determined 60 municipal middle vocational modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches. The number of each pilot project is about 50, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
In accordance with the principle of first trial and then implementation, from point to surface, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and unified cultivation of students, and truly improve the positioning skills of students, increase the employment rate and employment quality of students.

South African doctor: Omicron is highly contagious but mostly mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant are lighter than those caused by the Delta variant, although the transmission speed is faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the South African province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the organization's director, said he sees dozens of patients a day, but none have needed hospitalization.
Pilee said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation. "
He said this includes older people and those with health problems, who are more likely to become seriously ill from the coronavirus.
He said that compared with the previous Delta wave, the COVID-19 patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
A lot of people are going to be hospitalized in the next few days."
In the two weeks since the Omicron variant was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences.
While collecting enough data will take several weeks, doctors' observations and early evidence have provided some clues.
According to the summary of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the past few weeks are severe cases, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospitalization time has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of COVID-19 patients died recently, while the mortality rate was 20% in the early epidemic in South Africa.
William Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At the moment, all the signs are that this is a milder disease."
He added: "It's still early days and we need more data.
In general, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we've only been in this wave of the pandemic for two weeks."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although the Delta variant is still the dominant strain of the coronavirus worldwide, the Omicron variant is now present in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases discovered in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90%.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Commentary on Education: How to save kidnapped children?
If we compare this with the well-known slogan of the famous public welfare advertisement that “there is no killing without buying and selling”, then, in a good environment without the demand for “buying and selling”, group prevention and control, and all-people anti-kidnapping, will make the kidnapping behavior unprofitable, risky, and expensive, and this kind of crime will not occur again and again.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security developed an emergency platform for child abduction information.
This is an Internet information platform established for the purpose of establishing an authoritative channel for the dissemination of information on missing children, and finding missing children in time.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion", I suddenly feel very warm.
The new technological means are not only named “art” and full of feelings, but also informationized, practical and effective.
Anti-kidnapping law enforcement is primarily aimed at recovering kidnapped children, protecting their personal safety and freedom.
Then comes the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be listed in many "big words" from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
But before the trafficking case is solved, the safety of the victims should be the priority.
Matters are urgent or not, under the urgent purpose of "rescue", controversial and disputed topics such as "whether selling children should be sentenced to death" can be put aside temporarily, but the rescue of kidnapped children cannot be delayed.
According to the experience of handling such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to leaving the scene of the crime as soon as possible after getting what they want.
If the search for missing children is delayed by one minute, the children may be one step further away from their parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will also increase.
In this case, taking out effective measures such as the "family reunion" platform to help solve cases and find children is a practical action.
After all, "rescuing abducted children" is a major task that requires the entire legal system to operate.
Striking a blow against crime, protecting the rights of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of justice, and from the meticulous enforcement, all require the care of “protecting the young and the weak”.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from family to society, can still be improved.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at the railway station, the parents are sleeping soundly, and they wake up to find that the child is missing.
You cannot expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a reasonable awareness of protection.
Taking turns to look after the child, or putting the child in a safe place, are the most basic measures to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police crackdown on kidnapping crimes, the buyer of kidnapped children should also be paid attention to and punished.
Individual crimes are often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, the statutory punishment for trafficking in children is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty may be imposed, and the property may be confiscated.
The starting point of punishment is high and the maximum punishment is heavy. In the trend of "light punishment", the crime of trafficking in children is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
However, there are still many trafficking cases every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward ideas about raising children, and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for these people should be synchronized.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking in persons, we cannot rely solely on strict law enforcement by the government.
If the "market" for kidnapping is widespread, the kidnappers are motivated by greed, and constantly innovate kidnapping methods, they will inevitably be trapped in a low-efficiency quagmire.
Therefore, breaking away from backward ideas, popularizing legal knowledge, also helps to eliminate the crime of buying and selling children.
Yang Haodong delivered a report on the 6th plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and the spirit of the provincial party congress in Ma Lan Shan
draw strength from the Party’s 100-year struggle
According to the unified arrangement of the provincial Party Committee, on the morning of December 10, Yang Haodong, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and director of the Provincial Propaganda Department, made an interactive report at Ma Lan Shan Video Creative Park.

Yang Haodong from the three aspects of ideals and missions, self-revolution and youth, party leaders and party theory, combined with his own feelings and personal experience, explained the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the conference in a detailed and comprehensive way.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the plenary session with the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speeches and important instructions on Hunan, the spirit of the Hunan Provincial Party Congress, and study it, integrate it, and strengthen the awareness of defending the “two establishments”, the awareness of maintaining the “two safeguards”, and the awareness of action, and move forward steadfastly along the direction indicated by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the Q&A session, the representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprises, and young people asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of “two establishments”, how cultural enterprises should grasp the direction, and how young people in the new era should draw strength from the party’s 100-year struggle history. Yang Haodong answered these questions with simple language and vivid examples. He exhorted young party members to draw strength from the party’s 100-year struggle history and unite closely around the CPC Central Committee. They should use their youth to fulfill their responsibilities and obligations.

The International Olive Oil Council classifies olive oil into two categories and five grades: virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil).
Virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is olive oil obtained by mechanical cold pressing of fresh olive fruits after filtering out impurities.
There are three grades according to the acidity:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) is the highest quality and highest grade of olive oil.
The taste is exquisite, with a delicate plant fragrance and an acidity of less than 1%.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, the taste is pure and fragrant.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity is less than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained by refining olive oil with acidity greater than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Virgin Olive Oil (Olive Oil): Virgin olive oil is a blend of refined olive oil and a certain percentage of extra virgin olive oil to adjust the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5% and a transparent pale yellow color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is obtained from olive pomace by extraction and refining.
If you've looked at the classification of olive oils, you'll know that acidity is a very important indicator.
After all, olive fruits are like grapes for making wine. Different varieties of olive fruits from different regions will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow olive trees:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil, temperature, sunshine, air humidity and rainfall for the growth of olive trees.
Outside the Mediterranean coast, it can only be sparsely planted in suitable areas.
Major production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, Argentina, Peru, South Africa and other countries with similar climate.
Olive picking month:
The flowering and fruiting time of the olive tree is from March to June each year, and the fruits begin to develop and ripen from July to October, from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the harvest season for olives (freshness is important for olive oil).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil ever found.
Democracy Summit Ends, Biden Says Flame of Freedom Will Never Die
The online "Democracy Summit" (Summit for Democracy) convened by US President Biden with the participation of government leaders and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world ended on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of people around the world, and dictatorships can never extinguish it.
He also said that the second Global “Democracy Summit” will be held next year.
On the second day of the summit, the representative of the Taiwanese government, Tang Feng, and the Hong Kong democratic human rights activist who is currently in exile in the UK, Law Koon-chung, also spoke.
Biden said, "We know the work ahead is daunting.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge because, as I have said before, democracy is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the efforts of the whole society.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and have the power to resist the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, and those who want to pursue power nakedly in the public interest. "
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the themes are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming the value of democracy.
This day coincides with the "International Human Rights Day".
Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, also said in his opening speech on the same day that the democratic cause faced challenges globally, especially the challenges brought by new digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Jimmy Lai delivered a pre-recorded speech at the summit, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and the Uyghur and Tibetan minorities in China.
He said, "For a long time, the world has been subjected to the rise of China, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the restoration of democracy is our top priority. "
Roger Kwok also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid of angering President Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you haven't realized (the CCP's) threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we lost.
This is also the reason why we need to change. "
Tang Feng, Executive Yuan Deputy Minister Without Portfolio of the Republic of China (Taiwan), delivered a video speech at the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Upholding the Value of Democracy", emphasizing that Taiwan is on the front line of resisting dictatorship and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience of how to combat the COVID-19 epidemic through information transparency and mutual trust.
He said, "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is flourishing, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global struggle against authoritarianism, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, the authoritarian governments in various places used public health and collective interests as an excuse to rationalize the violation of human rights, and the global democracy presented a backward trend.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to lock down the city to control the epidemic, and we do not need to shut down to defeat false information. "
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the US Department of the Treasury announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea, and a few other countries that were determined to have seriously violated human rights, and impose investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was determined to have used surveillance technology to assist in violating human rights.

Hello, the restaurant's saliva chicken is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to stick to it, so I want to practice first at a price that is about the same.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, and if you can't distinguish it, the normal price will be more friendly than the cheap one, and this kind of "entry-level drum" is actually industrial garbage.
Their strength is very low. When the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, and the hard ball can't hold it. It is difficult for experts to control.
Their logic and subtext is - tennis is so hard, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to buy the expensive ones, so they make a cheap one to fool you, you play with it a couple of times, and then you won't play again, so it's cheap and you don't care.
When you are really able to distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have progressed, and then come to my place to buy expensive ones, I will earn twice.
It is recommended to buy a second-hand good racket at a similar price, choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so the good racket cannot be sold at a high price, the new racket of 500 or 600 is very good, the second-hand racket of 200 yuan, do you enjoy the enjoyment of a thousand-yuan racket?
It is friendly to novices, but it is useless after the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.

In fact, there are many requirements for clothing matching for girls who are slightly overweight.
The skirt worn by fat girls cannot be too short or too long. The length should be about the knee, which can cover the fat part of the legs.
If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the legs.
Too long will make you look short and fat.
If you wear the top, skirt and long socks in different colors, you will look taller.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for plump girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are also a good way to cover your fat body. The noble and elegant black mini skirt is also the first choice for plump girls.
Wearing darker colours, especially black, will make you look slimmer.
If your calves are big, don't make your socks and shoes too noticeable.
The more popular, the better. The colors should not be too bright.
So that when people notice your legs and feet, they feel fat.
For girls who are slightly overweight, it is necessary to teach the tricks of wearing and matching clothes.
Fat girls should not wear tight-fitting short skirts. In addition, the top should not be too short or stuffed into the skirt, which will make people feel very uncomfortable. If your legs are fat, you should wear black tights or mesh tights (the kind with a fine mesh pattern). Choose a soft printed flared skirt and pair it with a shirt with a rolled collar, which can cover the shortcomings of fat girls very well.
Of course, there are rules for wearing short skirts for plump girls.
If a fat girl wears a mini skirt, she should choose a top of the same color as the skirt, which will make her fat body look taller.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most IN combination in summer.
If you are a MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, I recommend that you choose a short dress with a glamorous feel.
It can not only cover your big belly, but also show your advantages.
The A-line skirt will make you look slimmer, which is more suitable for fat girls. The top should be tighter, which will make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a mini skirt can also be tried by fat girls.
Chubby girls can also be fashionable.
As long as fat girls can master the rules of dressing, they will also be the focus of everyone's attention.
After changing the way of dressing up, it is also necessary to exercise more in life, and strive to get rid of the label of micro-fat girls as soon as possible 😄

Girl serves as target for sister's fundraiser: "Think of it as a flesh wound" - Xinhuanet
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, with the words "human target, 10 yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl willing to be a "target" to raise funds for her sister" went viral on WeChat.
The photo shows that a girl stands in front of a wooden board that is slightly higher than her head at Wulin Square in Hangzhou. The wooden board is marked with the words "human target, 10 yuan per arrow", indicating that passers-by can pay to use the bow and arrow.
This behavior triggered heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity responsible person of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau Xiacheng Sub-Bureau confirmed to the reporter of Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl was her sister's fundraising, which made such an extreme action, but such behavior is not worth promoting. After being advised, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl street "target" fundraising advised
A photo circulating on the Internet shows a long-haired girl standing in front of a large wooden board in the shape of a "T", with the words "human target, 10 yuan per arrow" written in black ink on the board, and her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay accounts written on another board.
The image caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this is "begging for attention", and there are also many netizens who sympathize with this.
“We found the situation at about 10 a.m. on the morning of the 23rd when we patrolled around the square. At that time, there were many onlookers. ”
The policeman of the Tianshui Police Station in the vicinity of the scene said in an interview with the local media that there were two girls selling things, both of whom were about 20 years old and dressed in a youthful and beautiful way.
Among them, the girl who was used as a "human target" was crying all the time, asking passers-by to play this game; the other girl was standing on the side and shouting, saying that her friend's sister was suffering from leukemia and urgently needed money for surgery, asking people to help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was fundraising for her sister's leukemia treatment. "
Last night, the publicity person in charge of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau Xiaocheng Branch told the reporter of Beijing News that the girl’s name was Ji Jiali and she was collecting donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, due to the fact that the treatment still needs more than 300,000 yuan, it is difficult to find a good way to raise funds, so it made this kind of behavior.
He said that during the whole process, two girls were used as targets, and one was responsible for shooting, but did not participate, and no one shot arrows during the whole process, but there were people watching and taking pictures, which were posted on Weibo.
Later, the police found that the arrows used were not subject to regulation.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate this kind of fundraising to attract attention."
After the police at the police station warned her, she left the police station.
Heat dissipation effect: good; thinness: convenient; appearance material: satisfactory; Asus has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
The performance is stable, and there is no problem with the heat dissipation of the four outlets. It is worth recommending.
This HP Omen Dragon gaming laptop is quite good, the workmanship and materials are satisfactory, and the brand is reliable.
The Asus ROG Strix Dragon price is not expensive.
In my opinion, the Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is really good. The gaming effect: The gaming effect is comfortable. It can play most of the games, and my PUBG has a high frame rate, which is very smooth, and LOL is not a problem. CSgo is also easy to handle, and most of the 3A games can be played.
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is not bad. The fan is very powerful. The work is relatively quiet, and the game effect is very good when the fan is fully opened.
Appearance material: The appearance is very cool, and the game notebook is cool. Display effect: The screen is very clear, and 1080 is enough to play games.
I think the laptop is not bad at all. It is mainly used for design, and the price-performance ratio is very high. It is lighter than I imagined, and it looks better than I imagined. The red on my butt is the color of a very good wine, not so vulgar, and the overall is much higher than my expectations, and it is worth buying. It is also suitable for girls.
Two years ago, I came into contact with the Honda Dark Knight. After two years, the price-performance ratio is relatively high, and the quality is good!
I also recommended this product to my friends around me!
I have already bought three machines in this series.
The appearance is beautiful and the configuration is also good.
I bought it for my nephew. I originally wanted to wait for the 418 bank activity, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance, so I missed the bank’s big activity. I feel a little regret.
However, the price-performance ratio is relatively high, and the logistics is relatively fast. Let's come back to review it after a period of time.
A brand-new, high-value-for-money gaming laptop, which has already been installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: I bought it for my child to do 3D rendering. The software has been installed. My child said that there is no problem in using it. This computer can do 3D design work.
He said the one he bought for his son was good.
The computer is very good, especially the attitude of customer service is very good. If you don't understand, you can ask. I recommend buying.
It's not bad, the graphics of the game are really good
What was hot in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
A few days ago, an article titled "Look! Project managers can compete for gold medals in the Olympics" was very popular. The article mentioned that project managers can be first in many projects, and no one can match them: moving bricks, going on business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers. Putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are not a problem.
The article seems to be a joke, but it also reveals the bitterness of project managers in their daily work, which reflects the lack of enthusiasm for the current project management work.
People involved in project management are also increasingly choosing to take action to get out of the dilemma in their work.
From the number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) applicants rising every year, it can be seen that more and more project management practitioners improve their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants in China was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, and the number of effective PMP® holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMP certificate holders has increased year by year, which means that more and more project managers have realized that: relying on the "old experience" to do things is no longer feasible, and the ever-changing working environment has made us know that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the road ahead.
However, after passing the PMP exam, can project management work go smoothly?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the knowledge points of the ten areas of project management and the five process groups, but they are still confused when they actually carry out project management work.
Many project managers often report the following problems: lack of awareness of project management, relying solely on personal experience, having theoretical knowledge of project management, but not knowing how to put it into practice; lack of a system of project management process regulations to support the work, which cannot be put into practice, project estimates are inaccurate, control sensitivity is poor, and the project is dragged on and on; the division of labor is not clear, and the "old hands" in the team do not know how to deal with it; cross-departmental assistance for communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance ...
Therefore, after focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, it has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key personnel, and has been awarded the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" by Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting. Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting brings the online course of "Training Camp for R&D Project Managers".
Research and Development Project Manager Training Camp is an online course. This is a way of fragmented online learning. It combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many research and development enterprises, and helps you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of project managers, so as to advance your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the development of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and to achieve high-efficiency operation for enterprises.
Talk is cheap. Let's take a look at how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only taught by the expert team of Zhongtian Huaxia (the original R&D management team of Huawei), but also combines the advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as rich template forms to help students convert the learned content into specific work after the course.

Jiexin advocates rational consumption to consumers before “Double 12” - Economic Observer - professional financial news website
This year's "Double Eleven" shopping spree saw the nationwide online payment transaction amount reach 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high.
The diversified discount coupons and live broadcast shopping, which attracted the attention of consumers, once again made consumers feel the benefits. On the one hand, this wave of consumption heat makes people feel that the national consumption power is becoming stronger and stronger. On the other hand, it is also necessary to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on the society and the mainstream consumption group of contemporary society.
On the eve of “Double 12”, Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Jiexin”) issued a call for rational consumption, reminding the general public, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, the performance of Chinese residents in the field of financial consumption is good, but there are large differences in financial behavior and skills, and the basic financial knowledge needs to be further improved.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and “the elderly and teenagers” will still be the focus of financial education. The “China Young People’s Debt Situation Report” released by Nielsen and the “2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report” released by CCTV Finance show that the young generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important channel for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the young generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, it is far from the label of “excessive consumption” attached to it by the outside world. Some young people do indeed have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behavior, and they have caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to the gradual increase of social problems. Financial institutions should have the courage to assume social responsibilities and guide them in a positive direction.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jietong has always been committed to providing high-quality and thoughtful services to help ordinary people build their own happy life, and advocating that consumers establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the call of supervision to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young groups.
In the past few years, Jietong has carried out all-round and diverse financial knowledge popularization activities for the youth group, including university students, and through various forms such as launching innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic universities, it has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people, helped them to establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably planned their consumption needs, and thus helped them to accumulate wealth for life.
With the arrival of Double 12, Jietong reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption concept and a correct money view, to resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, to avoid the traps of consumption borrowing, and to avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
It is necessary to plan in advance when consuming and pay off the debt on time.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as buying a car and buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose regular institutions and channels, and check whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications for operation.
In the future, Jietong will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterated financial products to provide consumers with services that are more in line with their needs and diversified, and continue to help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and become a consumer finance partner that consumers can trust for life.

Vietnamese People's Daily Online - Gulf Cooperation Council Faces Common Challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stopovers include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Qatar since the beginning of the Gulf diplomatic crisis in mid-2017.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive ban, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, while having close relations with Iran.
The diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC, and has had a negative impact on the economy of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have cut off land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in January 2021, when the countries signed an agreement towards "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore ties with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the country.
The Gulf Arab states resolved their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar for the sake of the interests of all countries and the stability of the region, in order to face common challenges.
During the visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of the two countries and the integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest 5 billion US dollars in Oman, and 13 cooperation memoranda of understanding worth 30 billion US dollars were signed by enterprises of the two countries.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf countries comes at a time when Iran and the world's major countries are negotiating the rescue of the Iranian nuclear agreement, which is known as the Comprehensive Action Plan for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement that has been criticized by the Gulf Arab countries because they believe it cannot solve the issue of Iranian missiles.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "rival" and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that not solving the Iranian missile issue and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Against the backdrop of the failure of the nuclear talks between the major countries and Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct talks.
Its aim is to prevent the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first GCC summit since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and at the same time to put forward measures to fully cooperate with member countries to face common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Claimed to be the loudest supercar exhaust in Johor!
This is a car that many men dream of.
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is more than RM200,000, the annual road tax is more than RM10,000, and it has four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, you can imagine how fast it is.
The editor does not know either. The data shows that the acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h only takes 2.9 seconds. That is, when the editor’s myvi reaches 30 km/h, the other car has already reached 100 km/h.
The low-slung body, the cocky scissor doors, the huge air intakes all over the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine under the glass, perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the car model, just Google it. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not give.
I was too much in the limelight. Everywhere I went, people were looking at me, and I felt very uncomfortable (actually, it was kind of fun).
RM1 for 1km (the owner doesn't care at all)
Practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it can be a bit awkward (because you can't get out of the car and get stuck halfway).
The engine is too loud, and you will go deaf when you get out of the car (but it is still very cool).
The body is too big, it will be very narrow when parked in a normal parking space, and it is very afraid of being hit by the door of the car next door when opening the door!
It's a bit lonely because there's no competition on the road (said by myself, not the car owner, haha)
Don't misunderstand, this supercar is not for sale, sorry!

Let university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits that a university has long accumulated in the process of development, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has played an important role in the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For Chinese universities, they emerged in the autumn of national crisis, and their spirit has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. They advocate the value concept of "Mingde Jiyiworld" and the nationalist responsibility of "Xingxue Qiangguo".
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization in higher education is becoming more and more obvious, and the competition in education, technology and talents in the global arena is intensifying. Higher education, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the "General Scheme for Comprehensive Promotion of the Construction of World-Class Universities and World-Class Disciplines" has not only displayed China's confidence and determination to move from a higher education power to a higher education power, but also put forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to strive to join the ranks of world-class universities in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis that there is still a certain gap?
Besides the firm confidence in goals, paths, and abilities, universities should also fully exploit three advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing overseas outstanding academic talents, learning and borrowing the advanced experience of world-class universities, and achieving significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the advantage of culture, by inheriting the wisdom of the five-thousand-year accumulation of Chinese civilization, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, and thereby consolidating power, creating brands, and enhancing images; and third, the advantage of institutions, by exploiting the superiority of socialist countries’ institutions, strengthening goal-driven motivation, consolidating consensus and synergy, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable solid guarantees for universities to accelerate catching up with the world’s advanced level.
In particular, it should be noted that the construction of world-class universities cannot be one-size-fits-all, and each school must play to its strengths while highlighting its individuality and uniqueness.
The characteristics of running a school should have both the common Chinese characteristics and the unique target position, school tradition and resource endowment.
From the perspective of Zhejiang University, we pay attention to highlighting the following three aspects in running the school: one is to highlight the characteristic of talent cultivation for innovation and entrepreneurship, build an integrated environment for cultivating students, and form a full chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; two is to highlight the characteristic of cross-disciplinary gathering, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create a regulatory environment for cross-disciplinary, actively cultivate cross-disciplinary emerging disciplines and symbolic cross-disciplinary achievements; and three is to highlight the characteristics of the school system and social service, carry out in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the Zhejiang University production-learning-research cooperation system.
In this process, the most important thing is to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of “Seeking Truth and Innovation”, the common values of “Diligence, Morality, Discernment, and Practicality”, and the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University of “Harmonizing the Yangtze River and Yellow River, Opening the Mind, Cultivating Virtue, and Serving the People” constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continue to accumulate cultural height, and gather spiritual power. The content is rich and the significance is profound.
Among them, “Han River and Yangtze River” emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, which reflects the spirit of “taking the world’s talents as my own” and expresses itself as absorbing the excellent concepts of world-renowned universities in running the school and educating students; “Ingenuity and Virtue” emphasizes the spirit of seeking the truth and doing good, which means that the university should not only pursue the truth, but also be tempered and polished by the cultivation of morality and character; “Opening the Way for the People” emphasizes the spirit of reform and innovation, which not only includes the pursuit of new knowledge and scientific research innovation, but also expresses the spirit of reform and development; and “Building My Country” emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that the university should always be with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University’s 120 years of running the school.
The wise listen to what is not said, and the wise see what is not there.
China’s higher education institutions should continue to take the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics into account, deeply understand the position of the times and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation, and provide endless power for the realization of national prosperity and the revival of the nation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

At a time when NFTs were booming, a new concept emerged in the cryptocurrency community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, some residents who lost job opportunities due to the epidemic began to obtain stable income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various gameplays, including NFT, and is currently the NFT project with the highest trading volume, with more than $3 billion.
According to TokenTerminal data, the daily revenue of Axie Infinity exceeded $8.2 million, approaching Honor of Kings.
On August 6 this year, the official of Axie Infinity claimed that its daily active users exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of Axie Infinity has transmitted a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character, and they can not only get fun and economic benefits from the game, but also participate in the management of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw the news about the share price of my friend, my greatest feeling was the choice of the enterprise in the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry, the first is to choose the industry with a large growth space, with a market size of more than 100 billion yuan; the second is to choose the industry with good future growth, and consider the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; and finally, choose the industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheers for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
Tactics are about "doing the right things," or doing things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", that is, to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, while tactics are about implementation. In most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) can be considered whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend the horizontal field (strategic thinking); how to improve the customer retention rate (tactical thinking) can be considered how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); how to improve the participation rate of activities (tactical thinking) can be considered how to set the correct activity KPI, achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and precise acquisition; how to improve DAU (tactical thinking) can be considered whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, bitcoin saw several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, defined bitcoin as the legal currency, which was the first time that bitcoin became the legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved ProShares to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the first time in eight years, and it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF to land on the U.S. capital market, expanding the cryptocurrency investment channel.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Thanks to the photographer and makeup artist, I have unique wedding photos.
Thank you to everyone who worked on today's wedding photoshoot. Can't wait to see the finished product.
Shooting a wedding dress is a real workout, especially for the photographer, who is constantly running and jumping.
The makeup artist was very thoughtful and designed a makeup that suited my face shape. The photographer was funny and humorous when he took the photos, and he deserved praise.
Thank you to my photographer and make-up artist for allowing me to see myself like this while I'm still alive.
He praised the woman, saying that her eyes were beautiful, her appearance was elegant and proper, and she was a good wife and mother, and would be thrifty in the future.

The most important thing about taking wedding photos is that the photographer and the make-up artist have the same aesthetics. Fortunately, I met him.
After seeing my wedding photos, I found that I was also "cheated".
Asian American groups file complaints against Yale, other Ivy League schools over admissions discrimination - Xinhuanet
Xu Jianmei, a reporter of Xinhua News Agency in Washington, reported on May 23 that more than 130 Asian American groups submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting against the discrimination against Asian American applicants in the admission process of three Ivy League schools – Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, which spearheaded the lawsuit, held a news conference in Washington on Tuesday.
Zhao Yu Kang, the chairman of the group, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American elite universities has increased many times in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in the three American elite universities has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian American applicants in the so-called "holistic" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong said that in 2014, the research of Sanders and other scholars showed that among the three universities, the acceptance rate of Asian applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have had a de facto racial quota for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua reporters that they hope that after submitting the appeal, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will launch an investigation and take measures to stop these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asians in recruitment after determining the facts.
They also hope that colleges and universities that have been complained about will actively pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies for Asians.
At present, the three universities have not responded to the complaints.
The Asian American Coalition for Education was founded in 2015 and had complained about Harvard's admissions policies, but the U.S. Department of Education declined to act on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese American groups, the complaint was also filed by Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American and Pakistani American education groups.
Equipment needed

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a workshop in Yushiting Town, Yueqing, Zhejiang Province from a real estate agency. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the workshop.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu discussed the details of purchasing the factory with the owner of the property, Lin, and paid a deposit of RMB 200,000 through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed on the "Purchase Deposit Receipt for Factory Sale" as the recipient of the payment. It was stated in the receipt that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller at double the amount, and the parties have agreed to sign a factory sale contract within one week. "
However, the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the scope of the factory sale, the payment method and other major terms of the contract, which led to the delay of the signing of the house purchase contract.
Considering that both parties failed to reach an agreement on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Lu.
After a long search, Mr. Lu finally found a house that he liked. He paid the deposit and prepared the down payment. All that was left was to sign the contract, but the seller refused to sell. Mr. Lu was helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Lin at the People's Court of Yueqing.
The court held that the defendant was not solely responsible for the failure to sign a formal contract, and that it should be reasonably inferred that the parties failed to negotiate, so the case should not be subject to the penalty for the deposit, and the defendant should not bear the liability of double return of the deposit.
After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment.
【Lawyer reminder】 It is necessary to fulfill the necessary due diligence in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary due diligence obligations, such as verifying the information of the owner of the property, whether the property is occupied by others, and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
On Saturday (December 11), the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said in a speech after the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday (December 10) that the United States held the "Leaders' Summit for Democracy", which was "to draw ideological lines, weaponize democracy, use democracy as a tool, and use democracy as a pretext for anti-democracy, to incite division and confrontation, and to transfer domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value concepts on others, carried out "democratic transformation", imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolutions", and caused disastrous consequences.
“Democracy” has already become the “weapon of mass destruction” for the United States to intervene in other countries.
The summit is a fulfillment of Biden's campaign promise.
The two-day summit is being held virtually, with leaders from 111 countries invited, including Taiwan's, but not China or Russia.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for criticizing the United States, saying that the United States did not have the qualifications to host such a summit.
Internationally and domestically, there are also voices of doubt, such as criticizing the invitation of some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and doubting the true intention of the Biden government to organize this summit for geopolitical purposes.
German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democratic summit
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that "the pathology of American-style democracy is fully manifested today, and the problems of money politics, identity politics, party polarization, political polarization, social division, racial conflict, income inequality, etc. are becoming more and more serious. American democracy is built on a capitalist foundation and is a "rich man's game".
In his speech, U.S. President Biden said, "As leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and have the power to resist the buffer and impact of dictatorship, and those who want to pursue power nakedly in the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not a given, "We have to renew it in every generation, and I think this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "face a continuing and troubling challenge at a time when democracy needs defenders."
The United States pledged to launch a one-year action after the summit, including a $424 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that all countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let's all make good on our commitments and report back on our progress next year."
Yeah, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address

How to drink Redbreast Whiskey?
Everyone has different interests, some people like to collect, some people like food, of course, there are also people who like to drink wine. Red Card Whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in the world, and Red Card Whisky has won the gold medal in the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has its own unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you're wasting its smoothness.
So how do you drink Redbreast Whiskey?
Here is a brief introduction.
How to drink Red Whiskey:
Johnnie Walker Red Label is a blend of about 35 different Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and traditional Scotch whisky characteristics, including sweetness and smokiness.
The entrance is rich and fresh, with a hint of herbs and a strong smoky malt taste.
It can be drunk straight over ice or mixed with your favourite drink.
With the entry of Red Card Whisky into China, in order to adapt to the taste of Chinese people, Red Card Whisky + cola or sparkling drinks such as Sprite or 7UP have become a lasting fashion.
These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the acidity, but also bring visual pleasure to people, and add drinks to change the taste of alcohol.
The traditional way to drink it is with a slice of lemon and sugar.
The genuine red vermouth has a bit of sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, and lemon can bring a fresh fragrance to the wine, of course, the sweet and sour degree can be adjusted according to personal preference.
The above three are the best ways to drink red whiskey. You can try it as a reference. I hope my introduction can help you.
Educational Thinking: How University Examinations Can Make "Academic Superstars" and "Academic Losers" Happy - Xinhuanet
Three students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the school leaders, reflecting their confusion about the university examinations, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examinations, change the examination types, and make the examinations truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, the university entrance examination has been a “hot topic” for a long time.
In the university campus, students come from all over the world, their abilities are different, and the level of learning is different. The learning conditions are also different.
Assessing a group with such diverse characteristics is bound to be subjective.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause a different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may be able to pass the exam at the last minute, but if they try other ways, they may achieve twice the effect.
As a result, the "lazy students" can pass the exam and even get a high score, while the "excellent students" never miss a class, and their homework, notes, and exam scores are all good.
In this way, it can be seen that the students of Lanzhou University of Technology reflecting the problems of university examinations are not without reason, and I believe that this situation is not only in Lanzhou University of Technology.
In this sense, we should applaud the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, people who have been to university are well aware of the phenomenon of cramming for exams, trying all kinds of ways to "steal" the exam questions from the teachers, and trying to expand the scope of the exam in order to get "special tutoring" before the exam, which is not uncommon. Even in the exam, there are cases of carrying cheat sheets and asking teachers to raise their hands.
In the author's opinion, as a means of assessing the quality of teaching and learning, the assessment of whether a university's examinations are passed or not depends more on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific formulation of examination questions based on this foundation.
When entering the undergraduate stage of university, the major begins to be divided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether to master the basic knowledge points of a subject comprehensively is the content of the university examination.
While the knowledge of undergraduates is basically the basic theory and basic knowledge of the discipline, from the knowledge point of view, the space for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "20 years ago, I learned the basic knowledge of mathematics in college. Now, I am still learning, and it is still the key. "
But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the examination questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, the examinations are usually formed by the examination group, and then the senior teachers in the subject are responsible for the compilation of the examination papers, and the examination papers are also reviewed by all the teachers in the subject, which can to a certain extent overcome the situation of repeated questions.
However, it is necessary to formulate a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning. The test questions should be based on the overall situation of students' learning, and the difficulty should be normally distributed. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively master the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze the level of students' learning, so as to grasp the difficulty and type of test questions dynamically, so as to highlight the test of basic knowledge, and at the same time pay attention to the test of ability, and at the same time innovate the design of test types.
The examination is the conductor of university education. What kind of examination, the students will have corresponding preparation plans. If this continues, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou University of Technology attaches great importance to the suggestion letter of students, and has deployed the plan for rectification throughout the school.
It requires each teaching unit to organize teachers to conduct research and end-of-course examinations and self-examination, and to formulate examination papers and related regulations. At the same time, it strengthens the supervision and inspection of the examination paper formulation and review process, and refines the evaluation of grades. It also strengthens the comprehensive evaluation of each link of the course teaching.
From the perspective of mechanisms, solving the problems of single types of test questions, repeated questions, etc. is a topic that universities need to face. Of course, appropriate regulations need to be formulated, but the key lies in daily efforts. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only to master the content of teaching, but also to master the learning situation of students. Both ends need to be mastered. Teachers and students will be better connected, and the examination will be more in line with reality, so that "academic geniuses" and "academic failures" can each get what they deserve.
If you can't change the store location for me, can I get delivery instead?

Golden Lady Bridal Photography (Nanjie Store) does not have any branches yet.
Before taking pictures, because our time was not arranged well, we changed the time twice. The consultant Lalan was very patient to help us arrange the time.
I chose a nice weekend to do it.
Lady Gaga's team, whether it be consultants, make-up artists or photographers, are amazing.
This is the first time I have ever done my makeup professionally, wow! I can't believe I will ever look this good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and the other sister (sorry, I can't remember her name) were super patient and the makeup was very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in Jiawang City. Fortunately, the weather was very good that day, and we didn't feel very cold. The makeup artist paid attention to our clothes, accessories, and headgear from time to time. If there was any problem, he would help us immediately.
The photographer was also very funny and we all had a great day.
When choosing the photos, because we saw many cases online, we didn't want to delete too many photos, but when we chose the photos, really, we didn't have the idea of adding photos. We just took the 24 photos in the package (I heard that my sister-in-law, who took wedding dress photos at about the same time, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000-yuan package, and I was stunned at the time. I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today, the photos were repaired, and Lanlan sent them to me. I felt that two of them were not very good, and they immediately helped me to repair them again.
Compared with the photos my sister took before, I think our photos are really satisfactory, simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend that everyone go to Xuanhan Jinfu to take wedding photos!
Set price: 3999 yuan
Thank you for your sincere wishes. I wish you happiness and success.

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificates due to shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper
KOTA KINABALU, Oct 11 (Bernama) -- The Sabah National Registration Department said it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October due to the depletion of stocks of special anti-counterfeit paper, affecting some 3,200 people to date.
However, the head of the agency, Keru Amimunus, assured that all babies who have already applied for birth certificates, their data has been recorded in the system, and the counterfeit paper will be reissued when the counterfeit paper arrives next week.
He made an explanation at a press conference in response to a report by a web media that there was a paper shortage in Sabah for 10 months.
He said that the problem had appeared two months ago, and Sarawak also faced the same problem.
“One of the reasons is that the Chinese factories producing customized anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, which led to a delay in delivery to China. ”
He explained that the security paper used in Sabah is different from that used in other states, so it cannot be borrowed from other states.
Keru Amimunus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6, and was handed over to the printing company on June 8 for partial printing.
“The agency will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and the final printing will be done immediately in Sabah. It is estimated that it can be handed over to the applicants within two working days (December 20). ”
“We will notify the applicants to go to the local bureaus to collect the admission papers. ”
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 application forms so far this year.
Waiting since 7:00
Are we there yet?
I mean food.

Education Information: Beijing Compresses the Proportion of Special Students for Middle School Admission in 2016 - Xinhuanet
On the 21st and 22nd of the month, the enrollment examination for students with special talents in Beijing middle schools was organized and implemented by each district education committee.
This year, all districts in Beijing have compressed the proportion of specialty students, and the competition for specialty students is more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the proportion of specialty students entering junior high schools in the district this year is generally not more than 5% of the total enrollment plan of the district, and the proportion of students attending the school is not more than 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
Students with sports, arts, and technology specialties who have registered online are eligible to participate in the specialty student recruitment examination.
For the convenience of students to participate in the inspection, Dongcheng District continued the inspection arrangement of last year, and set up 1-2 inspection sites in each school district, with a total of 13 inspection sites.
The examination points are divided into examination rooms according to the examination areas, and the time is divided into time slots. On the day of the examination, the students will enter the examination points in different examination areas at different time slots.
On May 23, the education and enrollment examination center of the district published the list of students who passed the examination online. Students can check the examination results online.

The State Council’s Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism for COVID-19 has issued a notice to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in ports and cities.
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work in port cities, requiring that people who leave port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) within the past 48 hours must hold a negative nucleic acid test report, and people who go to port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the day when the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities determine the scope of ports and announce it to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that the port cities with conditions could consider setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control in their jurisdiction.
The relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health and Family Planning Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the locality, and frequent exchanges between the two sides of the border.
Implementing differentiated management policies for different areas, a single line of defense against the spread of the epidemic has become two lines of defense, and it is hoped that the epidemic prevention and control can be advanced to the frontier, the risk of epidemic spread can be compressed, and the greatest effect of epidemic prevention and control can be achieved with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, a number of local clustered epidemics have occurred in China. All of them were imported from overseas through ports.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some local epidemic monitoring and early warning is not timely, high-risk personnel closed-loop management is not implemented, regular nucleic acid testing is just a formality, the disinfection of cold chain goods at each link is not in place, the management of centralized isolation sites is not standardized, and the epidemic emergency response is not scientific and precise.
The notice stipulates that efforts should be made from nine aspects, such as perfecting the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, and so on, to accelerate the shortcomings and weaknesses of port cities in epidemic prevention and control, and to do the epidemic prevention and control work scientifically and accurately, and to tighten the external epidemic prevention and control line.
The notice emphasized that each port city should synchronously study and deploy epidemic prevention and civilian protection work, publicize and smooth the hotline for civilian protection, and regularly check the supply and price of basic living necessities, as well as other potential risks, and solve and actively respond to the prominent problems reflected by the public in a timely manner.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners) where open land, water, and air ports are located, as well as the cities (prefectures, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government) where these ports are located. The specific scope will be determined and announced by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) according to the epidemic prevention and control needs.

YouTube exposes the truth of the US military's 20-year bloodthirsty killings - Xinhuanet
（Source: YouTube）
On December 11, a micro-documentary named "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States launched the war in Afghanistan under the pretext of anti-terrorism, forcibly exported American democracy through the war, and committed various crimes against humanity over the past 20 years.
Abusing drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian facilities, distorting human nature, and establishing a murder squad.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up "black jails" to subject "suspects" to all kinds of torture and personal humiliation.
One atrocity after another has stoked Afghans' hatred.
As the video says, the American "anti-terrorism" war "becomes more and more terrifying".
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but has only brought a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Click the video and let's expose together the truth that the United States uses "anti-terrorism" as an excuse to engage in a bloody massacre, and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article. From the perspective of business and the preservation period, it talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning. Although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the scope of business of the bonded logistics company, the following words may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many milk powder factories and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the bagged milk powder and the canned milk powder have the same raw materials. There is no difference between them.
Then people will ask: Why is the shelf life of bagged products one year, while that of canned products is two years or longer?
Or ask: Why is there such a big price difference between bagged and boxed products?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but people think that the expensive ones are the good ones.
There are also consumers who say that the taste or flavor is different because of this attitude.
Now, I would like to tell you the reason why it is expensive.
Why is there such a big difference in the price of the same raw materials?
Because most manufacturers consider the price when they set the price, if the bag price is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept it, which means that the manufacturer's profits are very low or even no profits. How can the manufacturer survive?
Therefore, they have a very large rise in pricing to ensure their profit space.
As a result, most manufacturers are promoting listening, rather than bagging.
In addition, there are so many manufacturers who spend hundreds of millions or even billions of advertising fees every year. Where does this fee come from?
You can imagine.
With the development of society, the promotion cost of the market, such as the promotion personnel of the shopping mall, the display cost of the shopping mall, the gift cost of the product, the advertising cost, etc. is also increasing.
So the manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and the prices are also constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product that comes out with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost increase of their raw materials is no more than 3 or 4 yuan.
In addition, some brands are willing to go to any lengths to promote their products. They cooperate with doctors in hospitals to promote their products, and earn profits ranging from RMB30 to RMB80.
China's relevant laws are absolutely not allowed to operate in this way. In fact, this approach is to cheat consumers.
It is recommended that people buy bagged milk powder and put it into the can under the premise that there is a can at home. In this way, the cost can be saved and the preservation and sealing of milk powder can be improved. There is no impact on children.
In addition, do not think that the shelf life of canned food is longer than that of bagged food. If the shelf life of canned food is the same as that of bagged food after opening, it is only said that bagged food is not easy to preserve after opening and is easy to absorb moisture and go bad.
The delivery was delayed, and the food had cooled down. After cooling down, it was dry and hard, and could not be eaten at all.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When you go to the book market, you can often feel the popularity of success books.
Today's successful self-help books preach a lot of "best practices" - that is, assuming or implying that you can "do" something, then telling you what you need to do.
In other words, it skipped the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
It is for this reason that these books all have one thing in common - either go all the way or don't go at all; either 100 or 0; either climb the mountain or just stay where you are.
This "best principle" makes everyone admit that "it is correct", but 99% of people will be scared away before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind to become a new person and make a 180-degree change", which is the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are conservative, resistant to change, and unwilling to change, it is obviously self-deception and beating a dead horse for you to shout "change" in their ears.
Most people will be timid in front of the two words "change" and will hesitate to move forward; or they will be impulsive and make a decision to "change" and boldly take the first step, but it is often short-lived, and they will give up after a while.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "From Tomorrow On" Xiangsheng is the classic expression of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem of the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, so that most people "sigh with envy".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a possible way for more ordinary people to walk on a relatively successful path.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories" - if you can't do 100, do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climb the small sand dune in front of your house, because that is also better than standing still.
In short, doing something is always better than doing nothing.
Because the threshold has been significantly lowered, it has become possible for ordinary people to persevere, and the probability of success will also increase.
Following the "second-best principle", the road to success is slightly longer.
In a nutshell, the "best principle" sounds like it's for everyone's success, but it's ultimately for the few; while the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people to benefit as much as possible.

Qinghai Lake naked carp resources increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year compared with last year, reaching 10.85 thousand tons, and have increased by more than 40 times compared with the initial protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp is also known as "Wei fish" and is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s of the 20th century, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was massively killed by humans, and the breeding environment of the naked carp gradually deteriorated. As a result, the number of Qinghai Lake naked carp sharply decreased. In 2002, the Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserve was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the China Red List of Endangered Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented closed-lake breeding of fish, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from catching naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial reproduction and release, as well as the cleaning of the main inflow rivers of the Qinghai Lake, the design of scientific and reasonable "passageways" and other measures, the naked carp resources of the Qinghai Lake are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that as of now, Qinghai Lake naked carp has cumulatively implemented artificial breeding and release of nearly 180 million heads, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources.
Qinghai Sanjiangyuan is an important ecological barrier and water source replenishment area in China and even in Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone to control the western desertification from expanding to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source area and the water area of Qinghai Lake, and to protect aquatic wild animals, and to maintain the biological diversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued notices of banning fishing in the key water areas of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has built a "one river, one river, one lake" comprehensive ban on fishing management system.

Would like to know if it was misplaced or if someone took it, thanks
It's been an hour and it still hasn't arrived
I just saw a long article about fake examples.
For the benefit of the uninitiated male.
Most girls will have their first period sometime between the ages of 13 and 15. Menopause usually occurs around age 50.
After the body is healthy, it will come regularly once a month.
However, it is not regular enough to be able to make an accurate prediction. There is a margin of error of about a week, so it is necessary to prepare in advance. Sometimes, if you are unlucky, you will flip over (suddenly advance several days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have it for three days, while others have it for a week; some people have light bleeding, while others have heavy bleeding; some people have no symptoms, while others are so painful that an ambulance has to take them away; dysmenorrhea changes over time, and just because you didn't have it before doesn't mean you won't have it in the future.
Uncontrollable bleeding for several days, 24 hours a day, from the start to the end of your period, all you can do is use sanitary towels or sanitary pads to soak up the blood to prevent it from getting on your clothes or chair.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandin, so it is effective to take ibuprofen as soon as possible to relieve the pain of the current month when the menstruation has not come yet, and it is useless to take ibuprofen after dysmenorrhea begins.
Due to uterine bleeding and excessive release of prolactin before menstruation, it is easy to get diarrhea.
If the period is about to come, the stomach is upset for no reason, and the period will come within two days.
Sanitary napkins should be changed every two or three hours, otherwise bacteria will breed easily. Apart from sleeping time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which is 42 pieces. If you prepare in advance, there may be 50 pieces. It is not necessary to use one piece every month.
The sanitary napkin does not need to be changed frequently. It can be changed every 5-6 hours, and at most, every 8 hours.
During the menstrual period, the hormones may make you more irritable, and the ovulation period may be unstable because of the changes in the body's hormones, which is very unfortunate. The body will trip you up.
However, the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional problems as an excuse.
It's not just blood, it contains detached endometrium.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then gradually becomes thicker, which can be understood as the uterus is a house. Every month, the house is built (the endometrium becomes thicker) to welcome guests, but the guests do not come, and everything is demolished (menstruation is discharged), and a new house is built for the next month.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For several decades every month for a few days, 24 hours of bleeding, accompanied by abdominal pain and back pain, who would want that?
But you were born because your mother had her period, which is there to prepare a house for you to live in for the first 10 months of your life. Thank your mother for having regular, healthy periods.
In the past, many things of women were suppressed, and the society brainwashed women that they were dirty and shameful, but the times have changed.
If someone thinks that menstruation is disgusting, thinks that the body's preparation for bearing life is disgusting, they shouldn't say it out loud in public. Girls, stand up, don't think that way anymore, you've never experienced it, and you won't experience it in this life, and you don't know much about men, don't be so ungrateful, how can you face your mother with this attitude? How can you want your own children?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary napkins, they are really useful.
Today is the winter solstice, and it is more disappointing to send the wrong one.
You have to book another meal for the kids
I hope that the shop will check the product in the midst of busy work.
Is my foot spa shorting out?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can play a very good role in foot care and health care. Today, the editor of Gome will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the improvement of people's health awareness, the foot bath tub has become more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market. There are foot bath tubs ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a large choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, the sales of bath tubs and other health care home appliances are booming, but bath tubs do not have special industry standards, so there are certain safety hazards.
Wouldn't it be too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water?"
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he soaked his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought that it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he did not expect that after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li tried his electric pencil, and the electric pencil lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the bathtub was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchants, and the attitude of the merchants was not bad, although he returned the foot bath. Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.
Because he found that this popular footbath, which has been around for a long time, does not have a clear and detailed industry regulation in terms of the setting of the highest temperature, the applicable population, the guarantee of the safety of the material, etc.
However, in general, foot baths are not likely to have electrical problems, but it is not excluded that some products are not strictly inspected at the time of production.
Therefore, when buying, choose a detachable foot bath.
Water and electricity are separated, with no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen to measure.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headlines - Hunan Daily Online - Huashang Online
Changsha Evening News, December 10 (Reporters: Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, Correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, Photographer: Li Jian) On the morning of December 10, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and the promotion meeting of Xinyang Red Tea were held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The event showcased the tea industry, innovated tea technology, promoted tea culture, and accelerated the goal of achieving a tea industry worth 100 billion yuan.
Hou Shunli, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Co-operatives, and Ye Hongzhen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: the origin of the red tea is in Xinhua, and the rise of the red tea injects new vitality into the “colorful Xiang tea”.
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have actively supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100-billion-yuan Xiang tea industry, and formed the development pattern of “Three Xiangs and Four Waters and Five-colored Tea”.
The tea industry in the province has stepped up innovation, and green tea, black tea, and red tea, the main tea varieties, have launched a series of initiatives. The main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea and tourism, which has boosted the income of tea farmers.
Feng shui changes, and red tea makes a comeback.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea, picking red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the value of tea gardens has risen in a straight line.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the right to use the “Lake Red Tea” trademark to the fourth batch of enterprises, and Xinyang won the “Lake Red Tea Origin”.
In the Xinhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants saw a high mountain tea called "Bingliushun" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Jun, Secretary General of the Anhui Tea Industry Association, said happily that although the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea leaf market to some extent, there are highlights from the tea expo.
The new Xinhua Red Tea has injected the connotation of tea culture, and the popularity is high and the transaction is hot. The Xinhua tea industry welcomes a new spring.
And if these foods are not hot, can they be eliminated?

Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered by rational thought and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese name "metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器" in the Book of Changes, "Systematic Arrangement Above", "Systematic Arrangement Below", which was translated into Japanese by Inoue Tetsujirō (Meiji period).
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extensions.
Metaphysics is "the study of what names represent real entities, and what names only represent concepts."
Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, is the study of God-free methods.
Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that studies consciousness and its relation to the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought in discussing "the relationship between the soul and the body".
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy concerned with the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all behavioral norms accepted by a group of people or a culture.
Ethics can be divided into meta-ethics (abstractly studying the nature of moral theory or criticism) and normative ethics (judging various different moral views, and giving moral guidelines on what is right or wrong.
It studies what moral rules people should follow, applied ethics (the academic study of applying ethical theory to real-life situations, including biomedical ethics and political ethics), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live, summarizing patterns observed).
It does not start from the anticipated theory, but investigates the actual ethical agents (moral agents) who make and are observed to make real choices, and all the ethical factors that lead to those choices, and discusses the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Varro and Montaigne.
The second part: the ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
The third part: the ethics of politics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British empiricist ethics, represented by Hume and others, 17-18th century, continental rationalist ethics, represented by Spinoza and others, 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire and others, 18-19th century, German Neo-Kantian ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel, 18-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and Westcott, 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley, 19th century, German Neo-Kantian ethics, represented by Lieber, 19th century, New Kantian ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, 19th century, Neo-Hegelian ethics, represented by Nietzsche, 19th century, non-rationalist ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche

You call in the restaurant
I just didn't want to go downstairs to buy things, so I spent so much money to order takeout.
Ding Zilin: To my friends.
On my own behalf, I sincerely thank all my friends for the humanitarian assistance they have given us over the past 30 years since the death of our loved ones. In particular, I would like to thank them for the humanitarian assistance they have given me since I issued a call for humanitarian assistance in early 1994.
Nowadays, most of the victims’ parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and become independent.
It was your generosity that helped us get through the most difficult times.
COVID-19 is currently ravaging the world, and most of the donors are retired.
Therefore, I sincerely appeal to you to stop the humanitarian donation to the Tiananmen Mothers group. This humanitarian rescue activity should have drawn a perfect full stop long ago.
I will always remember your love and believe that your deeds will be recorded in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express myself in this way. Please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere congratulations.
Tao Yi: I would like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by the IFCSS and MCDF.
All of Us or None and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations working on humanitarian relief, and their projects often overlap.
（Apple Daily Photo: The Tiananmen Mothers website is managed by Tao.）pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Aid money often fails to reach the hands of the victims of June 4.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Mr. Ding, a special group was established by the “Tiananmen Mothers” to coordinate and manage the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "Tiananmen Square Orphan Education Fund", which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, after all the Tiananmen Square orphans had graduated from university, MCDF established the "Tiananmen Square Orphans and Widows Special Poverty Relief Fund" and has been implementing it ever since.
The funding for these projects comes mainly from campus and social donations in 1989, individual generous donations, and support from the Democracy Foundation of our sister universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Laogai Research Foundation.
It wasn't until last year, 31 years later, that the victims of June 4 finally received a portion of the donations that had been raised in Hong Kong under the name of June 4.
During this time, China Human Rights also independently executed its humanitarian assistance projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the donation for the Tiananmen Square, which is for the consideration of the donors. We are indeed some retired people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. Therefore, we would like to express our thanks to Mr. Ding's "Dear Friend" letter.
We will respect the families' decision to end this project within two years, and will be ready to resume when needed.
I would also like to express my thanks and respect to those brave and generous people who have continued to donate generously and risk their lives to deliver humanitarian aid.

Effect: Photo effect: I took two sets of clothes. Overall, it is not bad. I like this set of photos.
Service details: Because I felt a little uncomfortable when I was pregnant, the makeup artist and the staff were very considerate. They let me rest for a while and kept pouring hot water for me.
Set price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the rabbit's review. Originally, I said that I would refuse the ancient style because it was not suitable for the ancient style. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you, Dandan, for your recognition. With your satisfaction, we will continue to move forward with full energy.
This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all my friends to come!
Whether it is reception, makeup, clothes, lighting, photography and post-production, there is nothing to complain about.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate, and will match your makeup according to your style, and the cosmetics used are all top brands.
Tian Liang, the teacher, is also very professional in photography.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing, and the best photography studios in Beijing need to be booked half a year in advance. My colleagues have taken photos in Beijing, and they are just so so.
I sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is not very good, and we feel that this is also the short version of most people. The photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Make-up artists, photographers, post-production design, a top-notch team.
Coming out, we and the people around us praised it.
I have already recommended my best friend, and my best friend is also very happy after seeing the film.
I hope that studios like this don't get buried, so that more people can discover them, and make films with their own style, rather than the same old, same old.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to Zhan Ying and Jing Ling for their five-star reviews. Both of them are very creative and innovative newcomers. We are a creative studio. As long as the customer likes us, we will do our best to complete it. I am grateful to know and meet them.
Sweet and considerate assistants, as well as lively and cheerful photographer teachers, every member of the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shooting experience, and it was an unforgettable experience. The effect of the shooting is much better than I imagined. Everyone has worked hard. I am very grateful to everyone. 😘😘
Thank you, Xiaoyu, for your comments. Meeting you is also a kind of fate. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, our trust is thousands of kilometers away. I am very happy to meet you. I will come to Qinhuangdao to play next time.

If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it takes 6 months to learn.
However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with very weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to study by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, we should look at the strength of the teaching force of the institution. If the teaching force is not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning. Of course, the teaching force of some newly opened training institutions is not particularly strong.
Secondly, it is necessary to investigate this training institution before choosing it. It is best to investigate the students who have come out of this institution. After all, only the students of this institution know how this institution is.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and the learning of this thing is closely related to your own situation.
For example, your profession, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you are in will all be related to the industry you want to learn or work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you are a computer major who has already graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend that you study on your own. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are very good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time invested is relatively large. Basically, you need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.
But if it is what I said, it is very convenient to self-study. Now there are many learning resources on the Internet, which are free, or you can go to Bilibili to get training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. Learning is not very tiring, and the teacher explains in detail. If there are problems, there is someone to answer them. In addition, it is helpful in learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions will sign employment agreements, and there will be internal recommendations. After learning, they will be recommended to go to the company. In this way, the interview process of finding a job in the later stage can be simplified.
The above are some of my views, because I don't know your situation, so I can only roughly introduce it. If you have other questions to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said I'd be there before 1, I saw it on the app

I haven't finished, what are you doing?
I accept all kinds of (installation, cleaning, repair) boiler hot water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, exhaust fan, lighting installation, glass polishing, professional plastering, housekeeping service.
Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up. Life is hard, but we have to keep going.
Life will not disappoint those who work hard. If you like it, please follow me. Thank you to those who silently gave me a like.
Life is like this. Others only look at the results, but we have to endure the process. Faced with life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue. We can look back at the road, but we can't go back.
Cleaning is a job, but also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is beautiful because of sincerity.
Although cleaning is the dirtiest job, we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude. When we see the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the tiredness is worth it.
My daily work
—— Your requirements, my service.
Serve from the heart, clean from the heart, keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fengguixiaojian helps you to do "clean" as much as I can, and service the love of home.
Guarantee the cleanliness of your home, build the monument of home service, service to the point, cleanliness to your home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning is my daily work.
The crystal chandelier is beautiful, but if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will be dull, and only after cleaning can it shine. Life is also like this.
We can only succeed if we work hard, and we can only create exquisiteness if we are meticulous.
Give me a chance, and I will make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself because professionalism is worth trusting. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It is not easy to do business in any industry nowadays.
But I always believe that as long as I have a sincere attitude, perseverance and hard work, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining. "
A day's plan is made in the morning, and all good things begin in the morning. I hope you carry happiness, luck, health, and good fortune with you as you start a new day and keep a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When I was a child, happiness was a thing. If you had it, you were happy. When I grew up, happiness was a goal. If you achieved it, you were happy. When I matured, I found that happiness was an attitude. If you understood it, you were happy.
Be the most sincere and kind self, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; life is a road, walk your own road; life has two treasures: a good body and a good mood, live happily until old age!
At every stage of life, you will encounter different problems.
Often, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it.
Since we cannot avoid it, we might as well face it.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; if you face difficulties head-on, problems will eventually be solved.
China-Saudi curators hold first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters Wang Hai Zhou and Hu Guan) - The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial was officially opened to the public on December 11 at the Diriyah JAX Art Zone in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
This biennale was jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China. The artistic director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China is Tian Feiyu.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which symbolizes the reform strategies adopted in the social and economic transformation period, and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Going Public", "Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, covering various forms such as painting, installation art and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists also attracted attention, and some artists used innovative ways to use recycled materials to create artworks, such as Xu Bing in the series of "Ci Xi Shan Wu Di Tu" (2014), which reconstructed a classic landscape painting with discarded materials.
Diriyah Biennale Foundation CEO Buckley said that he hoped that this biennale could establish an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to understand the vibrant cultural industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia and enhance interaction.
Tian Fuyu said, "The goal of the biennial exhibition is dual. On the one hand, it can allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and on the other hand, it can allow Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world. "
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the biennial exhibition. Artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Integrate and standardize the management of rural public welfare jobs - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) in order to continue to do a good job in employment assistance for poverty-stricken people, consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies related to the management of rural revitalization public welfare jobs to help promote the comprehensive implementation of rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare jobs, which are used to employ rural disadvantaged groups such as poverty-stricken laborers, and play an important role in helping poverty-stricken groups achieve employment and income, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of public services in rural areas.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments, including the Department of Human Resources and Social Security of Yunnan, the Department of Rural Revitalization, the Department of Finance, etc. It mainly unified and standardized the objects of recruitment of rural public welfare personnel at the grassroots level, the management of funds, the development of posts, and the management of posts.
In terms of job development, the new regulation stipulates that job development shall be carried out in accordance with the principles of "job development according to needs, job allocation according to personnel, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible for" and "one person one post, voluntary publicity, unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-employment training and on-the-job arrangement.
In addition, the new regulation also specifies the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare positions, and stipulates that the relevant departments should purchase commercial accident insurance for rural public welfare positions. It also requires relevant departments to regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare positions.
Wrong Address
Hello
Can the order be cancelled?
I re-ordered
Has it been cancelled?
Secondly, although the right-wing has had its heyday in history, it is not long, so it is short because a little sunshine will make it shine, and a little hot water will make it sweat; when it is a little satisfied, it will look at Shuhan, and when it is hit, it will be lost.
But in all honesty, the right has played a positive role in the progress of society.
From defining the truth standard after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
Three, as far as I am concerned, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements, and I also respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about social issues in China.
However, I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-revolution is inevitable, and revolution will inevitably lead to social chaos, damage to people's livelihoods, and a mixture of fish and dragons in political groups. Finally, foreigners will take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people. Those who try to take advantage of political opportunism are not rightists, but scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of social and political orphans.
If we say that the right has a positive impact on society, then the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when necessary. However, the left has no reason to exist, because the left wants exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifth, I have recently seen some friends cursing the thieves and criticizing the leftists at the same time, and I feel that it is not necessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and leftists. They are all the same, and there is nothing to reason about.
And don't try to prove we're right, and don't try to get the rogues and the loonies to admit it, why bother?
I told my friends: when the thief curses you for five cents, when the leftist curses you for the right dog, this proves that our middle way is right!
Many people also had ideals when they were young, but they forgot their ideals or pursued their ideals, but became obsessed.
And the ideal is getting further and further away, and even the slayer of dragons has become a dragon.
I feel that left and right generally refer to constraint and freedom, and China should be biased towards the left from its historical and cultural genes.
Domestic right-wing liberals emphasize efficiency and development, while left-wing liberals emphasize fairness and safety.
Nowadays, the society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, the competition between China and the United States is inevitable, and the left-wing is certain. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Even if you don't understand, you can just like it.
Say no more, Hua Hua is just like this
In the past two years, the US has imposed sanctions and blockades on Huawei's chips, not only putting Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also causing huge losses to "American" enterprises.
The United States suppresses China's semiconductor industry and requires its own enterprises and the enterprises of its allied countries to impose sanctions on China's semiconductor industry at the same time, which directly leads to the consequences that the orders and profits of global semiconductor suppliers are affected, the research and development investment of semiconductor production enterprises is reduced, and the production capacity is reduced, which leads to the chaos of global semiconductor supply chains.
At present, the shortage of chips has spread to all major industries in the world. For example, car companies have stopped production, mobile phones have risen in price, and almost all industries that use chips have suffered.
In order to master the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' technology giants have begun to move towards the "de-Americanization" path.
In order to firmly grasp the global semiconductor control, to restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken a series of actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and providing funds to support domestic technology giants. For example, Intel, an old-fashioned technology giant in the United States, invested 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing factories in Arizona, USA, and opened its wafer processing business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and might even take away TSMC's "rice bowl",
This is because Intel, as an old-fashioned technology giant in the United States, has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor industry for decades and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves. It is certain that it can quickly rise in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, the founder of TSMC, Zhang Zhengming, didn't care at all.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongming made a shocking remark: Intel's investment in building a wafer factory is ironic.
Zhang Zhengming's disdain for Intel's entry into the wafer field is due to the fact that Zhang Zhengming still harbors a grudge against TSMC and Intel 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s of the last century, Intel was the jewel in the crown of the US manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the world and dominating the semiconductor industry.
In the 1980s of the last century, the world's advanced semiconductor chips were always controlled by a few strong ones.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. Chip design, manufacturing and packaging were all completed by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model makes some small enterprises unable to bear it, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge production line construction costs and can only give up.
Under the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, it was possible to establish a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zetian's idea became a reality and TSMC was born.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (TSMC) has focused its main business on the "wafer processing" single link, without design, only providing wafer manufacturing services.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (TSMC), which was just founded at that time, was just a small fry in front of Intel, the giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhengming once found Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link in the semiconductor industry, it was obviously a little arrogant and refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhengming also determined that Intel at the time looked down on wafer processing services.
I didn’t expect that the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services would also start wafer foundry.
So, Zhang Zhengming felt that Intel's entry into wafer foundry was ironic.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel, of course, could not be complacent.
Today, TSMC has already rushed towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm chips 7 years ago.
Catching up is not easy.
Enough is enough

Let's take a look at some "weird hot searches" today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: the second day of the second lunar month, the price hike of Good Lefu, and the event of Huo La La, and the public opinion will expand to form a peak, and then the index will decline (smooth curve), and finally disappear. If there is secondary public opinion, there will be a small peak again.
They look exactly the same as the "Internet public opinion evolution model" displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot words were selected at random from the same event, and presented in the shape of a peak, a sawtooth, and a cliff.
The "peak" refers to artificial heating, which quickly rises to the top of the hot search list and attracts the attention of the public; the "sawtooth" refers to periodic heating, which ensures that the topic remains at the top of the hot search list; and the "cliff" refers to the collective withdrawal, which means that the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and has been assigned a new task and moved to a new battlefield.
As shown in Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time difference is only seconds. It must be that a unified group of water army received the task and launched a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen here: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for publicity, which ones stir up trouble, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgments, which ones stir up emotions, and which ones involve decision-making. Black production accounts carry out precise operations in batches and at different time points, taking into account all the elements of information dissemination.
Communication is a science, regardless of the position, emotion and other subjective factors, the black public relations will be nowhere to hide from the objective data.
Wherever you go, you will leave traces, and we will dig out these traces together.

Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 12 (Reporters Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Zhang Xiaoyu,
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron variant infection for the first time on the 10th.
According to Kailesh Jagutpal, the Minister of Health of Mauritius, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; the other infected person is a local resident who was infected after contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and returned to Mauritius, and his nucleic acid test was positive on November 30.
After isolation treatment in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons turned negative. They have returned to their respective residences.
The Cypriot Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country confirmed 3 cases of Omicron variant infection for the first time.
All three are students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. They did not go to the hospital for treatment because their symptoms were mild.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Serbian government has stepped up its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10, 2022, passengers aged 12 and above who fly into the country will have to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
On the 10th, the Serbian Ministry of Health also announced that it would begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health Kumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country found 3 cases of Omicron variant infection for the first time.
The country's health department conducted genomic sequencing of 12 new coronavirus positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found these 3 infections.

Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration
Address: No. 156 Xuancheng South Road, 12th Floor, Happy Home
At the beginning, it was recommended by friends because of trust, so I chose to come to see it. At the beginning, my budget was 70,000 yuan for basic decoration.
Upon entering the store, he began a series of scams.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan. They did not go to the site to measure the house. They said that my 135-square-meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They roughly looked at their materials and did not know what brand their materials were.
Their second trick is to drag you into the store to pay the deposit (and once you pay the deposit, you will never get it back, unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you how much discount.
This is a big hole, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan.
He gave me a quote with a lot of problems. The price of 70,000 yuan did not include the renovation of water and electricity, and did not include any doors and cabinets in the bathroom. These three are the main expenses of the basic decoration.
On top of that, their service fees are higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company. They didn't tell me anything at the beginning and made me sign the contract.
When I went to get my money back, they acted very experienced, with a special little team to deal with you.
It's the customer's problem, not theirs.
There are all kinds of excuses, and there are many details. I don't want to say them one by one. It's all tears. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house was decorated by them, and the quality was not good. They will calculate all kinds of fees for you later.
It's a scam, they're just the old fraudulent dragon head decoration, now changed to Da Mei, as if they went bankrupt and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a cheating decoration company.
In the future, when you choose, you can search on Baidu. Check these consultations because renovation is not a small amount of money.
If you want to ask a question, please log in or register first.
It is strictly prohibited to publish various forms of merchant reviews. For details, please refer to the merchant declaration.
Dianping Kunming decoration design channel provides you with the address, phone number, business hours and other latest merchant information of Da Mei 360 integrated home decoration. If you want to find an interior decoration company, just go to Dianping.
So terrifying, please cancel the order within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Okay, then don't cancel the conversation, if 5 to 10 days have not returned my money, I will definitely pursue.
I asked if 15 minutes or less could be cancelled

Xinhua.net - Geminids meteor shower will reach its peak on the 14th
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Rongjian) Astronomy popularization experts said that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminids meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe it after midnight on that day.
Beijing amateur astronomer An Jiu photographed the Geminids meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminids is 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
Geminids is also the second known meteor shower that is not associated with a comet.
According to Xiaolipeng, a member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomy popularization, the Geminids meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year. "The release time" can be from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is famous for its large flow and stability, and is known as one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, along with the Orionids and the Geminids.
One of the prominent features of the Geminids meteor shower is that the speed of the meteors is relatively slow, the colors are rich, and there are many fire meteors, which are suitable for visual observation and beginners in astronomical photography.
Yang Ying, an amateur astronomer from Tianjin, took this photo of the Geminid meteor shower in Tianjin Qingzhou on December 13, 2020.
According to the astronomical forecast, the Geminids meteor shower this year will reach its peak at about 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR of 150 (the number of meteors seen per hour under ideal observation conditions when the radiant is directly overhead).
Geminid meteor shower recommendation index map.
Last year, the Geminids meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminids meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight, and the spectacle will be a little less brilliant.
On the 14th, it was the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, and the moon was in the waxing gibbous phase. The bright moon will interfere with observation, but fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the Geminids meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the next few hours after the moon sets, but they should pay attention to keeping warm. "
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place in the suburbs or in the countryside with a high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view to the northeast, and then wait patiently for the moon to set, and observe visually.
It should be noted that the flow of the Geminids meteor shower is very large in all directions, and it is not necessary to stare at the radiation point of the Geminids meteor shower during observation.
If you are a friend who likes photography, you need to choose a wide-angle lens with a large aperture if you want to take beautiful "meteor shower movies". Use a high ISO and the largest aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and continuity, the tripod, spare battery and cable release are also indispensable. "
Xia Ruipeng reminded.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional television mentioned by the author should be liquid crystal television, and the difference between laser television and liquid crystal television in market positioning is mainly as follows:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of liquid crystal television, laser television is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser television itself is a product born for large screens.
At present, the mainstream size of liquid crystal televisions is between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of laser televisions is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color televisions.
In recent years, the delivery volume and sales proportion of laser TVs in the global market have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Midea, the sales volume of laser TV market will increase by more than 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason for its good performance in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Saisi Laboratory of the China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmology experts of Peking Union Medical College Hospital conducted a strict comparative experiment under the same conditions, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
The data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have strong eye protection characteristics, and even have a certain improvement effect in certain areas.
At a time when vision health is increasingly valued, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the TV market.
Secondly, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the falling prices of liquid crystal televisions, the current retail prices of laser televisions are mostly above 10,000 yuan. As the size and light source are upgraded, the prices will gradually rise.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It makes sense.
With the continuous development of the light source and technical level, laser television has many advantages that liquid crystal television and projection cannot achieve.
Thanks to the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is relatively shorter than that of the traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance. The space required is not large, and the host is small and takes up little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 nits.
In addition, the heat dissipation is lower, the equipment loss is small, and the service life of the television is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with frontier technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, and biomimetic screen, which can bring users more shocking visual and auditory experiences.
It is not fake demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and cost-benefit ratio, laser TV is not for audiovisual players. If you want to take into account large screen and viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. After weighing the pros and cons, you can make your own judgment. Just don't believe one-sided words.
Simply put, the ultra-wide angle near focus projector - the laser TV, in order to approach the screen, must use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and mirrors, which do not conform to the best optical design.
In order to block some of the ambient light, the use of the Fresnel screen is expensive, and the price of the 80-inch can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch liquid crystal.
In addition, I particularly dislike projector manufacturers taking the reflection of the screen to be good for the eyes as a selling point. I beg you, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light, and the reflection to the ceiling is also direct light, and the eyes can't see it. They have to be picky about liquid crystal TVs, which are also "direct light". When the TV is turned on, isn't the ceiling also illuminated?
Furthermore, if the projection screen is not a diffuse reflector, it cannot form an image.
The hot spot effect of the high gain screen was neglected, and a large amount of light was reflected into the eyes from a certain angle, which was really uncomfortable.
Feng Shou Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery, a store specializing in high-quality products, has no branches yet
After adding the WeChat booking date, the little sister arranged the available time for me, and the reply was quite timely.
I looked at the photography works in the store before going there. There were more outdoor wedding dresses, and they were very beautiful. The photography styles involved were also many.
After arriving that day, I simply exchanged my ideas with the little sister, and she was very patient to help me try two styles of clothes that I was hesitant about. Finally, we confirmed the makeup and hairstyle. The photographer will arrange some props before shooting, guide the actions, and pay attention to every detail.
However, it may be because I did not communicate the specific shooting ideas with him, so the style is not what I want, but it should be good-looking 🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help to select the photos, exchange the post-production style, and feel quite considerate.
It takes about half a month to repair the film and wait for the effect.
The second time I hit the jackpot on the buffet-style photo shoot! Most of the clothes in the store were available for a photo shoot.
In the end, she chose a black chiffon skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process took about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting was my younger brother, born in 1995. I felt a little shy, and I hope that I can give more suggestions to customers on the guidance of shooting actions in the future. He was quite talkative, and the shooting process was quite pleasant.
Feng Shou Visual Art Photography Gallery
Go to the homepage to see Queenie.
When I went to the store, I first filled in my name and phone number and then chose the clothes. The wedding dress can also be chosen. I changed three or four sets of clothes, and he was quite patient. After choosing, he made up for a long time, and the service attitude was also good. Later, he would teach you how to pose for the photos, and the feeling of the photos was that my face was too big. He said that it would take half a month to do the retouching, but it was sent to me in three or four days, and I felt that there was not much difference between the original film.
The overall environment is still good.
There are a lot of optional clothes.
There are about three makeup positions, and the inside is a photography studio.
The service is very enthusiastic and meticulous.
The stylist was very patient.
The photographer will also be very serious about the poses.
If the photographer is not satisfied, he will also actively propose to re-shoot.
【Experience】The double eyelid may be a bit overdone, and the original double eyelid has become a triple eyelid.
The eyebrows are also shaved, which is a little embarrassing for those who do not draw eyebrows every day.
The photos were delivered within 10 days, but I was not satisfied with the retouching effect. I felt that the double eyelids were still very obvious.
Because I was not very clear about the style, I tried two sets. After trying, I still chose the black evening dress. The little sister said that this set was more like the classic style of Hepburn.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist sisters were very patient in helping me. I was very satisfied with the results.
After doing makeup and hairstyle, we started to take photos. The photographer directed me to pose throughout the process, which was very easy and harmonious.
After taking the photos, I carefully selected four of my favorite photos to be retouched. The young man said that the photos would be ready in 15 minutes. The ending was very satisfactory.
I have not received a reply for 3 days... because your system cannot identify my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I used the same credit card every time I paid
I now have to pay shipping every time
Can I be exempted from the monthly fee until you finish your investigation?
Is it safe to buy an umbrella?
Xiao Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Companies (Revised in 2015)", those who want to become insurance brokerage companies must meet three key words: shareholders and founders have no major criminal records in the past three years, the minimum capital is RMB 50 million, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, these three are very strict, which can be summarized as to have strength, to be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (the supervisory authority of all insurance companies and banks in the country), and the shareholders to have good morals. As a small umbrella insurance agency, the policyholders do not need to question whether the small umbrella insurance agency is legitimate or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, which not all insurance companies can reach.
In this respect, it is good, and it is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Small Umbrella Insurance is like an insurance supermarket. Many of the star critical illness insurance products of many companies are sold on this platform. For example, the newly listed Anda Super Mary 5 critical illness insurance, the insurer and the reinsurer are Anda Life Insurance, and Small Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary. There is no need to doubt its reliability.
From the perspective of the payment model, the products of the Internet platform are cheaper because they do not have the operating costs of the retail outlets and the salaries of the business agents, so the Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payment, which can reduce the payment pressure of the insured, and can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's pretty good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of the professionalism of the salesperson: this is particularly important, because the insurance industry has very high requirements for professionalism, and many Internet product customers can buy insurance by themselves, so there will be many misconceptions in terms of health declaration and occupation, and non-insurance professionals will often add their own subjective ideas when buying insurance, thinking that they are healthy or meet the requirements, so there are many risks of rejection of compensation.
I myself used to sell insurance over the phone for "Tencent Micro Insurance" (just like Xiaoyu Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform). I am very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but the people are not. Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there are many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance for 60 million yuan, buying insurance and getting a mobile phone, getting 600,000 yuan of critical illness insurance for free, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are superficial, and they do not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the second month is the normal fee, ranging from dozens to 200, and many customers do not know what they are buying after a few years.
The insurance company thought it could pay 1 yuan, but ended up paying 6 million yuan.
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, if you do not redeem it, no one will remind you.
This is also a trap for the insured. The free 60,000 yuan of critical illness insurance is short-term, and if there is no other commercial insurance, what can 60,000 yuan do in the event of a critical illness? It can't solve the problem, and the insured will have to run naked in the future.
At present, the country is also severely cracking down on misleading internet insurance sales.
In summary, the platform is fine, the product is fine, the problem is the professionalism and ethics of the salesperson.
In fact, the products of many offline insurance brokers are more comprehensive, and customers have more opportunities to choose and more products, and some products have better cost performance than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers to insure offline products, saving them 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per person per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
I am an insurance broker of Mingya Insurance Brokers. I have 3 years of enterprise management training experience and have served more than 1,000 enterprise users. I have cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before the insurance, I will start from the needs of customers and customize insurance products for customers. During the insurance, I will compare three insurance companies for customers and strive to obtain the best underwriting results for customers. After the insurance, I will organize insurance policies for customers, entrust insurance policies, and let customers feel at ease.
Grow with every customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can help you!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete the entire insurance process independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all the steps can be completed independently by the insured.
Although the purchase of insurance on the Internet does not have much “ceremonial feeling” and may not even have a printed version of the contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "assembly line" of telephone sales, but buying insurance in this way also has a fatal problem, that is, the subsequent service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, shouldn't we think carefully about whether the "intermediary" we choose is a "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services in the future?

Thank you for your help
I have always opposed any form of defamation and abuse, and I will not tolerate this kind of personal attack.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of villain.
If we do not look at the parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the moment you started messaging me on Facebook to be my friend, to the moment you started posting derogatory things about me and my family on social media, I've been ignoring you.
You continued tagging me at a rate of six times a day after that, and even continued discussing about me with your so-called friends on Facebook in a shameless way, such as my appearance, figure, good upbringing, whether to have strawberries in bed, and so on. ... I'm done.
Little did I know that I would later receive photos of you from several of my friends' Facebook accounts, along with lewd comments.
Sorry, as a woman, I can no longer stay silent.
Instead of toning it down after my report, you've become even more brazen.
I don't care what your political background is, and I don't care what your status is. In our society, we need to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue with the jokes, the innuendo, the shame, the abuse, the insults, you can continue to say you only care about me, you can continue to say you're just concerned, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you, you can continue to deny that it's not you
No, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to comment on my appearance.
I don't even think there is a girl out there who would want to be so humiliated just to be famous.
A friend asked me how I was doing.
I told you so.
I don't think there's any girl out there who's been bullied like that and can say that they're OK.
Whether in the workplace, in society, in politics or in the business world, only those who have no basic morality will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice will prevail.
I have selected some comments for you to judge
Your own posts shouldn't be able to be impersonated, right?
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.

Vietnam News Agency - Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attends the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
During the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major meetings were held to discuss the topics of digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and post-epidemic economic recovery and development.
Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung said that in 2021, although the COVID-19 pandemic continued to spread, the number of digital technology enterprises in Vietnam and their revenue continued to grow by nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam was cultivated, concentrating on solving the major difficulties faced by Vietnam, and many digital products have gone out of the country. The ranking of Vietnam's digital technology has been improved.

Yangtze River achieves full coverage of waterway green comprehensive service areas - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) On December 10, the waterway green comprehensive service area in Wulong, Chongqing, was completed on schedule and put into operation. This is the second waterway green comprehensive service area in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the waterway green comprehensive service area in Luzhou, Sichuan, was put into operation on December 8.
With this, the waterway green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport, said that previously, the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had built and put into operation 10 waterway green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which had been widely recognized by sailors, and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the green comprehensive service area on the water is another milestone event in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River. The ability to receive ship pollutants and transportation services has been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the waterway green comprehensive service area is an important facility to provide all-round production and living services for ships and ship crews, and to help ship crews solve the "urgent, difficult and perplexing" problems.
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which were completed and put into operation this time, are integrated with life services, production services, and administrative services, with green environmental protection as the theme, and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the highlights. They will realize the “one-time docking and multiple services” for the ships in the port, which will make the ship crew work more efficient and convenient.
U.S. three aircraft carriers gather around China, the strongest weapon rarely visits Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional Report: The latest news on Sino-U.S. relations: The latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China; U.S. media also revealed that one of the strongest weapons in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal rarely visits Guam, sending an important signal to U.S. allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank, on January 9, the satellite discovered the US "Carl Vinson" (USS Carl Vinson) aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier carries F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier transport aircraft.
Besides the "Carl Vinson", there is also the "Abraham Lincoln" (USS Abraham Lincoln) aircraft carrier, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Strike Fighter Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy also has the "Ronald Reagan" (USS Ronald Reagan) aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Champlain" missile cruiser and the "Stockdale" missile destroyer.
U.S. three aircraft carriers gathered around China. The strongest weapon is rare to visit Guam. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that the U.S. three aircraft carriers were gathered around China.
（Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness） The three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China. The most powerful weapon is rare to visit Guam. On January 17, 2022, the US Navy's CMV-22B flight route.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness (Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness), and according to a report by the US Cable News Network (CNN) on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy armory visited Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada" carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads docked at the US Naval Base Guam on Saturday (January 15).
U.S. three aircraft carriers gathered around China. The strongest weapon is rare to visit Guam. It is analyzed that this is a signal sent to the allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
It is the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second since the 1980s.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China. The strongest weapon is rare to visit Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
Photo shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
（South China Sea Forum） The US Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada" to Guam this time enhanced the cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrated the United States' capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are generally referred to as "boomers."
The whereabouts of the 14 "Virginia"-class submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept secret.
Around the secret of the ballistic missile submarine, the "Thunderbolt" became the "most important survival weapon" in the nuclear triad system, which also includes the launch pits of ballistic missiles on the US mainland, as well as the B-2 and B-52 bombers that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about Meta's recent 26% drop, the market value evaporated 251 billion US dollars. Why did Zuckerberg say "facing unprecedented competition"?
In essence, Meta (former Facebook) is an advertising company, and its main income comes from advertising. Today's advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Whether it is Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on, they are all traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many apps are connected to Meta's advertisements through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta is difficult to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users, and it will be very obvious to users whether to allow the app to obtain their own information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow.
If Google strikes again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by companies doing business in China.
Meta has about several hundred employees in Hong Kong and several major agents on the mainland.
If Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel. Most of the money burned has gone to Meta.
It is interesting that now TT of ByteDance is one of the main competitors of Meta, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping Bytedance to advertise in Meta, and the performance of Meta in the Greater China region is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it's definitely not going to be better than before.
The era of Chinese companies burning money overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only interested in income, but more importantly, it is interested in the future expectations.
Clearly, Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg said "metaverse".
The metaverse is indeed one of the directions of the future, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story is not enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years.
So the next two years will be a difficult period for Meta.
Although Facebook is very prosperous now and has an annual income of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars, in fact, Facebook has a very strong sense of crisis. Compared with other Internet enterprises and high-tech enterprises, it has no good safe moat.
Although Zuckerberg's several social software now has a high daily activity, it is also the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp and so on, but in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has no confidence, and it will be overturned in the blink of an eye.
However, the concept of metaverse, which is unattainable, has no hope of success in the short term, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for new tracks, but I think his track selection is wrong, and it is a dead end. The above is my thinking for reference.
