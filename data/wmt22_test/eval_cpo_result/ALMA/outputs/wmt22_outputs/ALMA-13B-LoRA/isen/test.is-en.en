Shouting to the world
The marketing campaign "Looks Like You Need Iceland" seems to have gotten off to a good start, and the cries and calls of nature are starting to attract people from all over the world.
You owe me an apology, I need Iceland," says a woman somewhere in the world in a comment to an ad from the Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign on the video-sharing website YouTube.
Another viewer said he would keep Iceland in his heart forever and a young woman said she would have to get to Iceland as soon as possible as her boyfriend lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States and is expecting to have to wait a few more months.
Another viewer asks whether the route to Iceland is open, as there are no planes.
It is not known whether he is from a different time zone.
Egill Þórðarson of the advertising agency Peel, who worked on the ads along with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the response has been beyond expectations.
I've been involved in a lot of Inspired by Iceland campaigns that have been very successful but this new campaign is already breaking records.
At its core, it's about creating PR value, that is, getting foreign media to write about the campaign, and that has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in over 700 media outlets around the world, which together reach over two billion people.
The value of that coverage is priced at 1.8 billion ISK.
It's not bad."
The main market is usually the United States, and the campaign has gone very well there, even though Americans are not coming to the country any time soon.
According to Egill, well-known markets such as Denmark, the UK and Germany, as well as Russia, which came as a pleasant surprise, have also done well.
Then there were reactions from foreign areas, such as India, which were not intended.
“These ads have travelled further than we expected,” says Egill, and it is worth noting that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
We couldn't have asked for a better start.
The photographs on display here were taken by Arni Saeberg, a photographer for Morgunblaðið, during the filming of an advertisement with the title "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
Filming took place all over Iceland, such as on Skólavörðustíg in Reykjavík, at Reynisfjara, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökull and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions and the cinematographer was Óttar Guðnason.
The Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary, starred in the film.
Dozens of Icelanders were involved in the making of the ads, while filming was taking place in the south of the country, another group was working in the west and westfjords.
According to Egill, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, with a winter campaign planned in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
This is just the first phase of the work for the Icelandic Tourist Board, says Egill and adds that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone very well.
It's great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to."
Sprengisandur: Discussing the labour market, pension funds and much more
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Equality, will be a guest on Sprengisandur on Bylgjan today at 10.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the situation on the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other matters.
He also discusses rural affairs and the relocation of jobs to the countryside, which has gone badly and been controversial for years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, will also appear on the show, and he will discuss his criticism of pension fund investments and propose that the labour movement and employers withdraw from the boards of the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then we will talk to Ivar Ingimarsson, a tourism manager in East Iceland, and Árný Jóhannsdóttir, the CEO of Markaðsstofa Norðurlands, about the situation in tourism in the countryside.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if the summer's success was a harbinger of things to come.
You can listen to the show below, which starts at 10.
This is how it looks today, 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teen shows of all kinds.
However, she became famous for her role as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in the series Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49, married with one child.
She hasn't been seen much lately, but she did recently appear on Australian television to talk about Clueless.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, saying she was a wonderful person.
I have to admit that I based the character on girls I went to school with who weren't nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who that character was," Donovan said of playing Cher in Clueless.
Did not want to leave police station after overnight stay
Around fifty cases came to the attention of the police in the capital area today and the police's daily log states that the cases were varied.
The day at Hverfisgata police station started with police having to deal with a man who had recently been released from a cell after being jailed for drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not follow police instructions to leave.
The man was detained at the police station for further investigation.
A man was arrested in the morning suspected of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to intervene with two men in Breiðholt due to a report of an assault.
A woman who sat down to eat in a shopping centre in Kópavog was unable to pay for her meal and was therefore called to the police.
A car theft was also reported in the city centre this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked for her for a short time and she was then taken by force.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Cheerleaders - The Terrible Fate of the Gleestars
A curse has been blamed for the death of Glee star Naya Rivera, who drowned in California earlier this month, becoming the third main cast member to die young.
Glee is a popular television series about singing, dancing and happiness.
The series dealt with a high school marching band, their loves and their fates.
While it wasn't always easy to be in a girl group, through singing and dancing the characters of the show seemed to be able to overcome any obstacles that came their way.
But off-screen, tragedy has struck the cast and crew of the show, so much so that a curse has been blamed.
Naya Marie Rivera played Santana Lopez, a cheerleader who wasn't afraid to speak her mind.
After the series had run its course, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they subsequently separated.
However, Dorsey refused to press charges and the domestic violence case was dropped.
Rivera was reported missing on July 8 after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and was able to tell authorities that he and his mother had gone swimming and that Rivera had brought him back to the boat but never returned himself.
An extensive search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the area's sheriff announced that Rivera was presumed to have drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.
It is believed that she got caught in strong currents in the water and used her last ounce of energy to save her son.
The cause of death was listed as intoxication by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing Glee to prominence.
Outside of the show, however, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his co-stars on the show intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith went into treatment and seemed to be on the mend.
Just two months after completing his treatment, Moneith was found dead in his hotel room after going out with friends.
The cause of death was determined to be a lethal cocktail of drugs and alcohol.
Foul play was not suspected.
Moneith had been receiving treatment and his tolerance for drugs had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death weighed heavily on his co-stars, but at the behest of his Glee co-star Lea Michele, it was decided to continue production and dedicate an entire episode to Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow Glee club members, until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of possessing child pornography.
A huge amount of child pornography was found during a search of his home, and the case quickly became public.
It was clear that Salling was done.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his crimes.
He was facing four to seven years in prison, as well as having to register as a sex offender and seek treatment for pedophilia.
Before the judge determined the sentence, Salling, who was out on bail, was found near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the show's actors who died young.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the series.
He died suddenly in his sleep in 2013, at the age of 41.
Also working on the show was a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the superstar Julia Roberts and did not paint a pretty picture of her sister, accusing Roberts of being very controlling and disrespectful.
Motes took her own life in 2014 after battling severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her boyfriend in which she blamed her mother and sister for how she ended up.
My mother and so-called siblings get nothing from me but the memory that they caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and abusing her co-stars on set and having an over-the-top diva attitude.
Jesse Luken guest starred in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was a major scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
In 2010, she was the victim of hackers who stole nude photos of her and posted them on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and were in a relationship outside of the show.
Benoist later revealed that Jenner had abused her during their relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything
It helps children develop when they get to play in the garden with their parents growing flowers and watching them grow and thrive.
It is also endless what you can do with flowers, as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just spending time with the kids in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the smell and, of course, the precious time they got to spend with their parents.
Bought a boat after tenth grade
I don't think there are many fishermen working in kindergartens around the country," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who works as a fisherman in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland in the winter.
Beach fishing is a very convenient summer job when you are studying.
If you catch a lot of fish, you can make good money, and I think it's great to be able to avoid student loans.
The income also helps me get through the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who has been engaged in coastal fishing as in previous summers.
Axel was just docking in Tálknafjörður when the reporter caught up with him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
The winter I was in tenth grade I got my captain's license for boats under twelve meters and I bought my boat the summer after I finished high school.
I have fished commercially from my boat every summer since.
I bought the boat used from a friend of mine, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after him.
Hartmann was an adult when I bought the boat and he was no longer at sea, and he was very happy to see that the boat was named after him.
Hartmann died a few years after I bought the boat,“ says Axel and adds that he bought the boat for three million.
I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, $1.5 million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I was done fishing.
By the end of that first summer I owned the boat outright."
But how could a boy have a half a million to pay out in a boat when he had just finished primary school?
I had saved up and put money aside, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I fished with him every summer and got my share.
I also put my confirmation money into my boat fund."
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all his mother's family is from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
I can fish here on the west coast because I have a permanent address with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I learned about these areas out west from rowing with my dad.
I move between fjords depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Although I prefer to be on the west coast, I have also fished around Snæfellsnes and elsewhere.
I have also fished in the south, but mostly for herring," says Axel, who always goes out alone early in the morning and sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, for hours on end, out on the open sea.
The internet connection at sea is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't mind being on my own.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into trouble, but there have been a few occasions when the weather has been bad, but never any real danger," says Axel, who is lucky that he never gets seasick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes each time.
I am never more than 14 hours fishing at a time in the inshore fishery, but I have also fished in other systems, such as the lease quota, and then I have been out at sea for 24 hours straight fishing.
The quota system for coastal fishing is such that he can catch 770 kilos a day, which he finds restrictive.
Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I am only allowed to fish for twelve days a month, during the four months that the coastal fishing season is open, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to calm down instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to choose for themselves.
The quota system could also be changed in my view, and fishing grounds that are well situated in the fishing grounds should be allowed to benefit from this," says Axel, who mainly catches cod from the sea on his coastal fishing trips, but also some ufsi and a few other species.
Axel works at the Núpur preschool in Kópavogur during the winter.
I don't think there are many fishermen working in kindergartens across the country," Axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
I got stuck there because I love this job.
I hope that my psychology studies will help me in the future as a preschool teacher," says Axel, who is also well on his way with his studies in business administration.
Mistake in registration prevented home quarantine
An error in a form that people fill out when they arrive in the country resulted in a person resident in Iceland not being called back for testing.
It is not a requirement to enter the ID number if the person fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is filled out in Icelandic.
This will be looked at this week, a public health expert says.
Three domestic infections were detected at the Department of Virology at Landspítalinn yesterday.
One of those who tested positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the so-called homecoming quarantine rules came into effect.
Those who are resident in Iceland are then screened on arrival in the country and then called in for testing four to five days later.
According to RÚV's noon news, however, the individual in question followed the old system.
The border test was negative and he was not called back for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an epidemiologist at the Directorate of Health, says in an interview with the news agency that this can be traced to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English, they do not have to enter their ID number, as is required in the Icelandic version.
After all, it was primarily intended for foreign tourists.
As a result, the individual did not receive an automatic invitation to get tested.
Kamilla says, however, that many have followed the rules on home quarantine, even though they have filled out the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people in for testing after they arrive in the country.
This will be looked at this week on how to make it easier for people to access this to raise awareness of the process."
The man is in isolation and six have been quarantined.
They all went through testing, but two were showing symptoms.
Contact tracing is now underway for the three cases reported yesterday, but is largely complete for the two cases reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequencing by Íslensk erfðagreining has revealed that they are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the focus has been on Israel, even though it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should become clear tomorrow where the other virus is coming from.
There are now 15 in isolation according to the COVID.is website.
135 are in quarantine.
Four of five cases unrelated
Five domestic infections have been detected in Iceland in recent days.
Four of them are completely unrelated and, for example, the source of the infection at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday has not yet been found.
Contact tracing is ongoing.
Originally, there were more than a dozen people in isolation, but they were reduced to sixteen.
In total, 34 are in quarantine because of these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that the virus has been detected at a sporting event, raising questions about whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communications officer at the Civil Protection and Emergency Management Department of the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police Force, says it is very easy, as long as people follow guidelines and regulations.
We are constantly reminding all those who live here of the need to maintain individual protective measures.
We also need to remind people that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
Then you can hold events," says Jóhann.
He says that infections can be prevented by maintaining individual protection measures.
Rules and standards are also under constant review.
What needs to be done, and what the Civil Protection Department and the Directorate of Health are constantly reminding people of, is to pay attention to these individual precautions.
Both at home and at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use hand sanitizer.
It prevents the spread of infection," says Jóhann.
We need to remind people that we need to continue on the good path that we were on in order to maintain the success that we have had so far.
40% of COVID-19 victims had type 2 diabetes
Devon Brumfield heard her father struggling to breathe over the phone.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he died.
The death was attributed to acute respiratory distress caused by the coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as an underlying condition, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that she's next.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
Nearly 40 percent of those who died had type 2 diabetes, according to new research funded by the U.S. government.
When the proportion of those under the age of 65 is considered, it rises to half.
The CDC study looked at more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from COVID-19 between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease expert at the CDC, says the findings are striking, especially for people with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
Reuters, which commissioned the poll, said the responses from the 12 countries that responded pointed to similar proportions.
Ten states, including California, Arizona and Colorado, are not yet reporting underlying conditions.
Diabetes was already an epidemic in slow motion.
Now, COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful tsunami," Reuters quoted Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago, as saying.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American descent, who have also been hit harder by the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease in check with exercise, a healthy diet, and help from healthcare professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
Then there is the high price of insulin, which has forced some to keep going to work and risk exposure to the virus.
Reuters points out that U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risk diabetics face from the virus.
During the SARS outbreak in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and during the swine flu outbreak in 2009, this group was three times more likely to be hospitalized.
When MERS emerged in 2012, one study found that 60 percent of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because of the lingering effects of the COVID-19 virus, the pandemic has revealed a number of previously unknown side effects.
I fear we will see a tsunami of problems when this is over," said Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Federation.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic could lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney failure.
New research also suggests that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the links between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weakened in many people with diabetes.
High levels of glucose and lipids in diabetics can cause a true "cytokine storm," as it is called when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to the formation of blood clots, which can be fatal.
It's all one big puzzle," Dela Cruz said.
It's all interconnected."
The story has been corrected.
We were offered champagne, so they left the room
A married couple, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason, accepted an unusual proposition from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work he was installing in Paris.
We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason will never forget the first time he met his wife and child's mother, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir.
I fell in love with her.
It was just the aura, but I also thought she was incredibly cute.
And it still does," he says.
Ásrún also remembers this, and her husband often reminds her of the first meeting.
I'm always hearing this story.
Just last weekend," she says, also attracted to her husband at first sight.
There's so much hype around Atli, which I dig.
There's a lot going on and a lot happening and I was drawn to that."
Atli says that the couple have stressed the importance of going their own way in their relationship.
We do not bind our baggage the same way as our fellow travellers.
We avoid routines that we see around us."
Perhaps this is why they greeted Ragnar Kjartansson's presentation with such enthusiasm, even though it was quite unusual.
Kristín Anna, our mutual friend, contacts us and asks if we can join her, Ragga and Ingibjörg, Ragnar's wife, for dessert at Snaps.
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had desert wine and their own dessert.
They listened to Ragnar as he led them through his plans for an art show he hoped to put on at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
He had a multi-screen video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Ásrún says he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating.
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in was meant to show a young middle-class couple falling in love in a minimalist room.
This is sex with a beginning and an end, says Atli.
The couple didn't know Ragnar very well, though they knew of him and he of them, "but they knew us and thought we fit the bill.
They said they didn't want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people, but people who get off on performing for others."
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
When we walked out of Snap, we said, "Aren't we just up for this?"
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his whole team," says Ásrún and Atli agrees.
This is about love and closeness
The scene was filmed in a nice apartment on Mýrargata.
There was a very small film crew; a cameraman, Ragnar and a sound man and the couple.
After the recording started, everyone left the room except Atli and Ásrún.
We hadn't decided how we were going to be.
We got some small instructions but we tried to forget time and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
We didn't play, we just loved each other, so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
Yes, it was a bit romantic, says Atli and Ásrún agrees.
We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was like being on holiday in a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the pair's performance in the piece, which moved them.
When Tommi the cameraman saw this he cried, he thought it was so beautiful, says Atli.
This is as much about love and intimacy as it is about the sex itself, says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice of his son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and realized that he was part of the work.
Then she turns around and starts thinking about it," says Atli.
My mum and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this, but then my dad sent me a message and said: It was fun to run into the little family at Palais de Tokyo, Ásrún recalls.
And did participation in the work deepen the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
At least we're still together, so maybe it deepened something.
This at least deepened my relationship with my in-laws," says Ásrún and laughs.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
It was a little difficult to not be with you, but with someone else," she says, turning to her husband.
But it was nice to see it because it's just one scene in a much bigger piece and when you see it with the other pieces it's very cool.
I was able to distance myself a little bit from it and be proud.
And there was a little bean in my belly," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the scene was filmed.
It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrún and Atli on Rás 1's Love Stories.
Swansea win first leg of play-off semi-final

Andre Ayew made up for the missed penalty by scoring a great goal to secure Swansea a 1-0 win.
Swansea lead the tie 1-0 ahead of the second leg at Brentford next Wednesday.
Ambassadorless for five years since 2009
U.S. Ambassador to Iceland Jeffrey Gunter Ross is in the spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he requested an armed bodyguard because he feared for his life.
However, it has not gone smoothly for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador to Iceland.
Since Carol Van Voorst stepped down as U.S. ambassador in late April 2009, the country has been without an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under unusual circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Order of the Falcon.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the Presidential Office informing her that she would not be awarded the title.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months later, Van Voorst's successor took office in September 2010.
This was partly due to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador but then withdrew.
Finally, Louis Ariega, who had worked in the Foreign Service for a decade, took over.
He then retired in the fall of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then came another period without an ambassador.
Robert Barber was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in January 2015 and came on board shortly thereafter, filling a gap of 13 months without an ambassador.
Barber was a political appointee but not a diplomat, having worked as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign.
He left office on January 20, 2017, when Donald Trump took office, as is customary for politically appointed ambassadors.
Trump's administration has been unusually slow to appoint both ambassadors and senior officials in Washington.
Two years later, the U.S. Congress called Jeffrey Ross Gunter to a hearing to grill him and confirm him as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony to the committee, he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, and his late wife was Dutch.
Gunter is a political appointee, was previously a dermatologist in California, and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The group was founded by casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, an ardent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter arrived in Iceland in May 2019, at a time when no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest gap in Icelandic diplomatic history.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration has taken to nominate people to key positions, as well as the fact that the U.S. Congress has dragged its feet on confirming ambassadors in recent years.
Since 2009, Iceland has been without an ambassador for a total of over five years.
However, this has not prevented the embassy from carrying out construction work, which recently opened a new headquarters at Engjateig.
Construction is estimated to have cost around 6.5 billion won, with thick security walls surrounding the building and bulletproof glass in all the windows.
However, it does not seem to have been enough to reassure the current ambassador, who is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former IBV player subjected to racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, the former IBV player, says he was subjected to racism while in Iceland and regrets coming to the country.
This is according to an interview with Tonny that was published by the Ugandan media outlet Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined top-flight Ugandan side Uganda Police FC.
In an interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Iceland where he played for ÍBV, Valur and Þróttur.
When I came to Iceland, I wasn't playing in the middle like I was used to.
The captain of the team was in that position but also had the jersey number I wanted so I didn't get either of the things I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right wing for ÍBV this season.
Tonny talks about the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem many black players face when playing in Europe.
This happened to me once but because I didn't understand the language I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I heard about the case and then I asked my friend what the case was about.
He told me then that my opponent had made racist remarks about me after I tackled him."
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland to join Haugesund in Norway.
There he says he made the mistakes he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to get into the starting line-up at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
He then asked to go back to Iceland on loan and joined Val.
It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had stayed in Norway for longer, I would have got the opportunity I wanted," Tonny said, hoping that if he played well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He wants to believe that the loan to Iceland has put an end to his dreams of playing for a big club in Europe.
Worm found in woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black worm in the throat of a woman who sought treatment there.
The doctors managed to pull the worm out with tongs.
It turned out to be a parasite.
CNN reports.
The woman had eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of raw meat, a few days earlier.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites like this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi became popular in Western countries, the number of cases where parasites have infected people has increased, according to CNN.
Fear of second wave in Europe
Spain is now in focus in relation to concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, but the government has taken action to curb the spread of the coronavirus epidemic again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment venues have been closed for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action in response to the rise in infections in Spain, with everyone in the UK required to self-isolate for 14 days after returning from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned against travelling to Spain.
Infections are also rising again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance between curbing the spread of the virus and reviving the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to the rest of the world, where the number of new infections is approaching 300,000 per day, with the most infections in America and South Asia.
There are now more than 16 million confirmed cases worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, and more than 644,000 deaths linked to the virus.
Gerður's mosaics finally get their due
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
Above them are men with orange helmets.
There is also a big pit.
And smaller construction equipment.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the pavement is passable, and now many are stopping to admire the million-piece mosaic artwork - as if they've never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least, he didn't seem to notice.
The work has so far been somewhat obscure, with a car park directly in front of it.
People parked there, locked their cars in a hurry and then ran off to do their business in the city center.
A "vibrant and diverse public realm" and an "attractive urban character" are the guiding principles behind the ongoing redevelopment of Tryggvagata.
The aim is to improve the area and allow the mosaic work of Gerður Helgadóttir at the Customs House to be seen better.
There will be a piazza in front of the work, and as the site is well exposed to the sun, it is considered suitable as a resting place for travellers.
The work of art will be illuminated and the materials will be better displayed on this 1,420 square foot space.
There will also be small ‘mist blowers’, a kind of water sculpture, which will provide play and a sense of mystery to the area.
This is how Reykjavíkurborg, which is in charge of the project, describes the renovations.
Water, heating and electricity pipes will be renewed.
Many of them are past their prime, but the sewer and water mains are from 1925 and have served the residents and businesses of downtown for nearly a century.
When the road is reopened after the work is completed, cars will be able to drive on it again.
But it will be a one-way street, creating a calmer and more accessible space for pedestrians.
According to information on the Customs website, the building was completed in 1971 and the architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because the warehouse penetrated through the house, there was a 250 square meter windowless wall facing the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such a flat would have a negative impact on the overall street view, unless special measures were taken to enhance the appearance of the building.
It was therefore agreed that a permanent work of art would be installed there.
At this time, a lot was said about Gerður Helgadóttir, an artist, says the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaics in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether to hold a competition for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work should reflect life at the harbour, as the harbour had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was built.
When the artist was interviewed, she was stunned by such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður got the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home, she presented a few proposals for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the work.
In addition, it was requested that a comprehensive contract be made with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Oidtmann brothers, as Gerður had worked with them for a long time to set up famous works of art throughout Europe.
An agreement was reached and Gerður created the work under the supervision of the brothers' workshop, which then installed the Tollhúsið.
The entire project was handled exceptionally well, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, according to the summary.
It has stood up to the harsh Icelandic weather ever since.
It took Gerði about two years to complete the work, which was created and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Customs House was completed, at the age of 47.
Moving more institutions out to the countryside
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be moved to the countryside in the near future.
This is what the minister said in the Sprengisand programme on Bylgjan in the afternoon.
Recently it was announced that the Fire Safety Division of the Housing and Construction Agency will be moved to Sauðárkrókur in the fall.
Six fire safety experts work for the agency, but none of them plan to follow the agency north and the National Fire Protection Association has criticized the move.
I think we need to take further steps in this matter.
I am preparing further steps in this matter.
Further moves," Ásmundur said.
He says he is convinced that a large majority of the population want to see more public institutions distributed around the country.
I think we need to make further political decisions about moving public sector jobs out to the regions, just as I am doing with the Housing and Construction Authority, he said. He also gave the example of other institutions that have been moved out to the regions and have made a big difference to communities in the countryside, such as the move of the Food and Veterinary Authority to Selfoss, Landmælingar Íslands to Akranes and the unemployment insurance office to Skagaströnd.
All the latest from the second day of the Masters
The 94th Icelandic Championships in Athletics concluded at Þórsvöllur in Akureyri today.
A few records were set on the second day of competition.
Exciting competition was expected in the women's javelin at Þórsvöllur but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set an Icelandic record in the javelin in 2014 which stood until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR broke the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic record back earlier this summer and has been in great form lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic record this summer.
Elísabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and did not play well today.
She only had one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69m which is a long way off her best.
Vigdís threw the farthest of all today, 60.08 meters in her last attempt and set a new meet record.
Her Icelandic record, which she set earlier in July, is 62.69 metres, so she was some way off that.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day when she improved her personal best with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's competition, Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic record holder in the javelin, won a comfortable victory, throwing 73.84 metres in his penultimate throw to set a new meet record.
His Icelandic record in the event is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, an Olympian and Icelandic record holder in discus, won the shot put competition at Þórsvöllur yesterday but today he competed in discus, his main event.
Guðni Valur's Icelandic record is 65.53 meters but he threw 59.13 meters today to secure the win.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest throw of the day, 49.43m, which was good enough for second place.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the Icelandic record holder in the long jump, won the long jump with ease. Hafdís jumped 6.25 meters today, which is almost 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir, from ÍR, was the fastest in the 200m women's race with a time of 24.04 seconds, but her personal best is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was successful in Akureyri as she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100m sprint and in the 4x100m relay and also in the 4x400m relay today.
In the men's 200m, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH won in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Máni Samúelsson from Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100m yesterday as well as the 400m.
Not fined for 27 million króna Bitcoin harvest
The First-tier Tribunal (Tax) has dismissed a claim by a tax inspector for a penalty against a man for failing to declare his cryptocurrency profits.
The committee concluded that the tax inspector had not provided clear reasons for why it was necessary to fine the man.
In its ruling, the commission found that the man had filed materially incorrect tax returns for the years 2016 and 2017.
He would have understated his capital gains from the sale of Bitcoin cryptocurrency worth £27 million, either deliberately or through gross negligence.
The man should be fined for his behaviour.
The man denied it in a letter to the committee.
However, he admitted to selling cryptocurrency for $27 million in 2016.
He would have acquired it by mining in the years 2009 and 2010, when this was both easy and cheap with a regular home computer.
He also pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the tax implications of such a sale were very unclear and unpredictable.
It would hardly have been possible to expect that ordinary citizens would understand such arrangements on their tax returns.
He would not have been able to avoid paying tax on the harvest and would have disclosed his ownership of the property on his tax return as a deposit in a foreign currency account.
He had asked both experts and the tax authority about how this was handled, but without success.
He also noted that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived there for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to understand the complex rules that the tax authorities did not have a clear view on.
The man believed that his taxes for these two income years should be reassessed and penalties applied, but otherwise no punishment.
He then reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes here since 2012.
He had never intended to evade his responsibilities by unlawful means.
The demand for a fine would be out of all proportion and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur causes a stir: "This man knows what football is about"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been the talk of the town a lot lately, but he has also been praised for his performance so far this season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max league.
Breiðablik will be in the spotlight tonight when they take on ÍA in a live broadcast on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is suspended for the game due to four yellow cards in the season, and will therefore not play with his new haircut as in the games so far this summer.
He had "bla, bla, bla" written on his forehead before the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
I don't know exactly who he was responding to with the payment, but in terms of character, he was certainly trying in the game.
He did not hide.
He wants the ball every time and if there was going to be an equaliser in this game, I thought he would make it or create it," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stand.
I'm here for the people."
Sometimes it's hard to figure out where he's at.
He drifts a bit out to the left as the games go on, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólfur is a real entertainer and is happy to have such a colourful character in the division: "There is no doubt that this is a character.
It's a fun type and I love the hair, and always being ready to do interviews.
There's a lot of people that are obsessed with him, which tells me that this guy knows what football is about.
I am an entertainer.
I'm here for the people and to have fun."
People are reading the interviews with Brynjólfur, people are paying to watch and see what comes next.
This guy is just a genius," Máni said.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with a few teams in the second division"
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in the Pepsi Max league, seems to be on his way out of the team.
According to the Danish media outlet Bold, Tobias is ready to go back to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the matter.
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country, but first he has to terminate his contract with KR, as the Danish league starts before the Icelandic league ends.
The club knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias told Bold.
I've been in contact with a few teams in the B-deildin and will probably make the switch before the end of the Icelandic season.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to buy out my contract at KR."
He also says that he will probably have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
Companies in Denmark have probably felt the economic impact of the virus more than in Iceland.
Bicycle whisperer Bjartmar has recovered bikes worth millions - Responds after DV coverage
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He sniffs out and recovers lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles and scooters.
As a result, Bjartmar has earned the nickname "Bicycle Whisperer".
Yesterday there was quite a stir when a man published an account of his interactions with Bjartmar.
DV referred to discussions on a Facebook group for Westurbæingar, where it was stated that Bjartmar had spoken to the man on Austurvöllur and said that the scooter might be stolen.
Was it not clear from the original writings of the scooter driver that Bjartmar had stolen from him?
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original DV article has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says that the initial reports of the incident at Austurvöllur do not reflect what actually happened yesterday.
Bjartmar said he had been told by the victim of the scooter theft that it was indeed his scooter.
The information was given to the alleged owner by another person, but the information turned out to be false, says Bjartmar.
I saw the goat and I recognised the scooter, as I had information that this was a scooter that had been missing for a long time and had been searched for.
I was hesitant at first, but when I saw him getting ready to drive the golf cart, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was adamant and I decided to talk to the man.
Generally, I'm very good at handling these situations, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word from me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the scooter offered to show him the receipt for the scooter and called the police himself.
Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this done."
The scooter's owner then proved ownership of the scooter and drove off.
Later, the rightful owner of the scooter told his story on Facebook, as previously reported.
Bjartmar says he can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times he has fallen out with people since he started this practice.
I've had peaceful dealings with the toughest guys in Reykjavík," said Bjartmar, pointing out that bike thieves are often the smallest brothers and sisters of the community, addicts, mentally ill people and other people who for some reason are on the street.
Addiction is a hard taskmaster and somehow the next fix has to be funded, unfortunately theft of loose change is an easy way to that end, says Bjartmar.
My dealings with these people have been so good that I have a lot of the good people on my side.
There are examples of people going through treatment and getting themselves together and then coming to me and helping me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmar's interactions with cyclists are polite.
Some know of him and what he's doing and offer to show him receipts, bike serial numbers, and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has received little attention.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are now even telling people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is unhappy with DV's earlier reporting and says he is not some kind of self-appointed vigilante on a personal crusade for justice.
Asked whether he is not on thin ice with his actions, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says that this is certainly the case.
Of course the police should be doing this, but the fact of the matter is the police are not doing this.
I have, for example, seen the police drive away from a large pile of stolen bikes.
She is utterly clueless on these issues."
When the police aren't doing anything about it, and it's right in front of your face, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this area, then why not? Bjartmar asks.
He says he has been so successful in recovering stolen bikes that sometimes he runs into his "clients" on the street and they just give him back the bikes they had stolen before.
On the occasions when Bjartmar has called the police for help, they have simply not shown up.
It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the bicycle owners' fault," Bjartmar said, adding that it's a shame that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer from the inaction of the police in this area.
There is no debate about Bjartmar's success.
Stories abound of people thanking Bjartmar for recovering their possessions.
Bjartmar himself says he has long since lost count of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts are certainly in the millions, if not tens of millions.
Electric scooters, bikes and mopeds weigh heavily, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a preschool during the day and works at a residential facility every other weekend.
His bicycle search is therefore unpaid work he does in his spare time.
Pensions and long shadows
2019 was a landmark year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had indeed received pensions from the Danish king since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for civil servants was established, which eventually became a pension fund for all public employees.
The basis for the current occupational pension schemes of general wage earners was then laid with the all-encompassing collective bargaining agreements on the labour market in 1969, which provided for occupational pension schemes with compulsory membership and full-fledged fund accumulation from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were passed based on these agreements and the pension system continued to grow.
The employees' pension system was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century brought about through its struggle for wages.
Unemployment insurance had been won in a similar way in the famous strikes of 1955, and the union also gradually won its demands for sick leave, health insurance, significant holiday rights, shorter working hours, improvements in housing and so on.
All of these rights came at great cost and with great struggle, but in retrospect they proved to be a much greater and more lasting gain than the increase in the amount of money in the pay envelope, which disappeared just as quickly in the heat of inflation that characterized the post-war period until 1990, as many remember.
The lead-up to the establishment of universal pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although it was eventually agreed that the funds would in fact be the property of the fund members, the labor movement had to accept that the boards would be composed of representatives of employers and fund members in equal numbers.
In the following years after the founding of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers in the boards of the funds was often discussed in trade unions, but it never came to fruition, and so we are still left with the abnormal situation that the representatives of the funds are not in the majority in the boards of the funds.
Section 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on compulsory pension funding and the operation of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
Paragraph 1 of Article 1 states that "the pension fund shall have the interests of the members as its guiding principle."
Paragraph 5 also states: "The pension fund shall set ethical guidelines for its investments."
In the shareholder policy of the Lífeyrissjóður verslunarmanna, among other things, the following provisions follow on from the aforementioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in North America and Europe.
The guidelines discuss how an emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance, can contribute to improved investment outcomes for funds.
In this way, the interests of investors and the goals of society in a broader sense can be reconciled.
LV believes it is important for companies, especially those listed on the stock exchange, to have a public policy on: good corporate governance, remuneration, social responsibility and environmental issues.
Iceland's largest pension fund, Gildi, has adopted a "responsible investment policy" which contains similar provisions.
This is all revisited here as an introduction to the latest fashion word in Icelandic, "shadow management".
As the term is new in the language, it is not surprising that it has not been fully defined, but the following definition seems to be the most widely accepted: Shadow-directing is when a union leader tells the media that he intends to instruct union representatives on a pension board to vote a certain way on a particular issue.
If they do not comply, they will be removed from the board at the first opportunity.
However, if the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about the dismissal, it is not "shadow management" either, since such communication between people is of course always present in the financial world, as in other places.
I leave it to the reader to decide which way is "more sinister."
As of the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020, there are two men who have tried to shape this definition.
They are Hörður Ægisson, journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, Central Bank Governor.
The trigger for both was Icelandair CEO Birkir Hólm Guðnason's announcement that he intended to tear up the company's collective bargaining agreements with flight attendants and cabin crew (fire them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Retailers' Union, sent out a message to the union's representatives on the board of the Lífeyrissjóður verslunarmanna pension fund urging them not to support the fund's possible purchase of shares in the company, or else they might be sacked.
A little later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and Ragnar Þór followed suit with his recommendations, of course based on Bogi's decision.
Nonetheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw fit to editorialise on the matter in the Friday edition of Fréttablaðið, using big words about shadow governance, law-breaking and the need for legislative change.
There, a little sparrow certainly had to lift a heavy burden, although the blessed sparrow was in the process of being wiped out.
Given the importance of the matter, let's focus on the substance at the end.
I have described the relevant provisions of the Pension Fund Law above.
This means that fund managers must act in the best interests of fund members and have ethical considerations in their investment decisions, and this is further elaborated in the regulations of both Gildi and Lífeyrissjóður verslunarmanna, as I mentioned.
Pension funds, however, SHOULD NOT ONLY look at short-term profitability in their investments.
Such a policy would be extremely dangerous and there are plenty of examples from the past where large loans from banks and funds have flowed to unscrupulous adventurers and environmental disasters, with disastrous consequences.
Icelandair's CEO was obviously on thin ice when he thought of wiping out an entire group of employees, reducing the goodwill the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw the error of his ways and retracted.
Time will tell whether this is enough to justify the pension funds' investment in the company.

One of the infected did not practice home quarantine
One of the three people who tested positive for Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from an Eastern European country on July 15, just over a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who is not permanently resident in the country and therefore did not receive clear instructions about the so-called post-travel quarantine.
He tested negative at the border.
However, he is part of the Icelandic community and should have gone into quarantine, Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an epidemiologist at the Icelandic Directorate of Health, told Fréttablaðið today.
He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to enter the ID number and if the ID number is not entered, you are not automatically called for the second test.
She says that the man could have used the English form because he is actually resident abroad, but because of his network in the country as an Icelander he should have used the Icelandic form.
However, he did not realize this.
When the ID number is not registered, you have to apply for the second test yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seemed to realise that this was the right thing to do," says Kamilla.
Therefore, it is clear that we need to improve the information given about this while we find some way to make an automatic notification system, even though Icelanders do not enter their social security number.
Or to make it more obvious who is participating in the Icelandic community in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, the individual in question encountered few people upon arrival in the country, despite being defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six have been sent into quarantine since he was diagnosed yesterday and all six were in contact with him.
They will undergo testing but two of them are already showing symptoms of Covid-19.
The man tested negative at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says it is likely that he was recently infected with the virus and that it had not yet been detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the possibility that the man became infected in Iceland, but did not bring the virus with him to the country.
It's not really possible to say that this is definitely an imported case because it's been so long since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed to it like these two who have caused a bit of a stir in connection with the sporting events.
However, she says it is very unlikely because of how few people the man interacted with here.
It is actually very unlikely, says Kamilla, but adds that it is not possible to rule it out until the Icelandic Genetic Corporation has sequenced the virus in the man.
If we get a virus type that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain that he brought it in.
Tear gas and pepper spray used against protesters
There were clashes between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and stun grenades against protesters, who smashed windows and set fires.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police brutality and racial injustice were protested across the United States last night, including in Seattle, in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
One protester was shot dead in Austin, Texas.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered for peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and smashed the windows of the city's courthouse.
Following this, the police described the protests as riots and clashes broke out between groups of protesters and police.
Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police in August last year, was remembered by protesters in Aurora, Colorado.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of Black National Guardsmen gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March.
The group carried firearms and marched in formation to a closed intersection where police separated the group from a group of people who also carried firearms to protest the protest.
Seventy-five people were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters were remembering James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjaer: Not the game that defines our season
Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer does not want to make too much of the importance of today's match against Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea do not lose to Wolves, Solskjaer and his men will finish in 5th place and miss out on Champions League qualification.
However, they still have a chance to qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
We are not done yet.
If we get a result against Leicester I think people will say we haven't had a bad season," said Solskjaer.
But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a long way to go to catch the two teams above us," Solskjaer said.
It is clear that the nerves of the players will be stretched at 3pm today but Solskjaer tried to play down the significance of the game.
If you want to play for Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and that is what the company is based on.
We have created ourselves a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is up to us to take it," Solskjaer said.
This is not the most important game of the season, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The result doesn't define our season, we've already had many moments that define this season."
The arrival of Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I think overall we are in better shape and mentally stronger than last season," said Solskjaer.
65,000 new cases per day
65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were reported in the United States yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 cases have been confirmed in the United States since the start of the outbreak there.
Yesterday, 900 people died from the virus, but in the four days prior to that, more than 1,000 people died from the virus each day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a CNN report, the number of deaths from the virus will reach 175,000 by August 15.
Fear a second wave of the epidemic
Spanish authorities are now struggling to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spain's health authorities reported over 920 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no new cases in the past 24 hours since the beginning of May, and the news comes as Spain begins to lift one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.
The reversal has led to British authorities now requiring passengers arriving from Spain to go into quarantine upon arrival.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where authorities have imposed tougher restrictions to try to contain the outbreak.
In the capital Barcelona, nightclubs will be closed for the next two weeks and bars will have to close at midnight.
A curfew is now in place for 200,000 residents of the Segria region in the western part of Catalonia.
Britain's decision is expected to have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on tourism and has been badly hit by the pandemic.
Tui, the UK's largest tour operator, has cancelled all flights scheduled for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be bracing for a second wave of the pandemic, but there is little appetite for a return to widespread lockdowns that have devastated economies.
For example, Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken a very dim view of this and compared it to a nuclear weapon he does not want to use.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said the country "would not survive economically or socially" if a nationwide lockdown was reintroduced.
Many policymakers are hoping that locally tailored interventions that target individual towns, cities or regions will be enough to keep the virus at bay in the next round if it comes.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestically
Three domestic cases were detected yesterday, in addition to two more at the border.
Five people tested positive for Covid-19 in Iceland yesterday.
According to a statement from the Civil Protection Agency, one of the cases is linked to the case reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
That person has been quarantined and sixteen who were in close contact with him.
The infected person was a participant in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavík, and according to the announcement, "only part of the sports team" is in quarantine.
Others sent into quarantine are connected to the man in other ways.
The source of the infection is unknown and an investigation is underway by the national police force.
The organisers of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the guidelines and regulations of the Chief Medical Officer and Civil Protection and have made the appropriate arrangements.
However, pictures of the tournament yesterday drew attention as they showed very close contact between players celebrating their team's good performance on the field.
Around 11am today, the tournament organisers posted the following message on their Facebook page.
There it says "NOTE: Parents please respect the rule that competitors pick up their own gear from the school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another case was detected yesterday, but it is not related to the case reported yesterday.
It says in the announcement: "The Icelandic Genetic Diagnostics has sequenced the infections and a new type of virus has been identified that has not been detected before."
Contact tracing is also underway in that case and the infected person is in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third case is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15.
It was detected in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two more cases were detected at the border and are awaiting the results of further investigations, as the process at the border requires.
Finally, the statement says: The Civil Protection Department of the National Police Commissioner and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer urge people to exercise caution and take individual precautions against infection.
If there is any doubt as to whether a person has the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus, they are asked to go to the nearest health centre for testing.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite is fully booked over the holiday - directs visitors elsewhere
The campsite in Patreksfjörður is fully booked for the weekend, according to Vesturbyggð.
Guests are advised to consider other accommodation options.
Vesturbyggð mentions Bíldudal, Tálknafjörð, Melanes in Rauðasandur, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breiðavík as other options.
There is a lot going on in Patreksfjörður this weekend, as the Icelandic documentary film festival Skjaldborg will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the city.
Judging by the interest in the campsite, there should be a good turnout this year, if the weather doesn't spoil things, but DV reported earlier today that the forecast is poor.
However, the worst of the weather is expected to be in the south, and good news for Patreksfjörður.
The website bb.is reported first, saying that all other accommodation in the town was already fully booked.
Whole apartment block collapses in city centre
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhaga 18–20.
Meanwhile, owners are seeking building permits for renovations, but their applications have languished in the system for more than three years.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive areas of Reykjavík, a magnificent apartment building stands on three floors.
The ground floor of the building has about 600 square metres of retail space.
Behind the house are the entrances to two stairwells, each containing four fairly spacious apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square meters, though most are over 100.
The house has a long history.
It was built in 1959 and has housed a video rental, Skóstofan, the dairy Mjólkursamsölunnar, Jóa gunsmith, a fish shop, and most recently Háskólaprent.
The house, to put it mildly, has seen better days.
The house is now severely damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the building is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir, among others, according to the company register.
Magnús led a group of owners of Borgun and was the representative of the Borgun holding company.
Stálskip ehf. is one of the owners of the holding company Borgun.
Stálskip ehf. is an investment company owned by Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún also owns a third of D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once owned the fishing company Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has done little to maintain it since then.
Neighbors say the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily over the years, especially in recent years.
On a Facebook page for the neighbourhood, one resident said the house had "not been particularly lively in recent years."
The fact that the owners have been trying to change the house and the lot for several years may play a role.
Other neighbors say the house has not been in good shape for a long time.
It's long overdue to do something nice with this spot and it's sad that it's taken this long."
He also says that he is annoyed at the owners of the house for not getting on with it, finding a common ground with the neighbours of the house and stopping this "legal bickering".
Just do it in consultation with the community around here so we can get it done and get it done."
The "legal wrangling" the resident refers to is the planning process for the site, which has been going on at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the building, a new lift house and a single-storey extension with a basement.
The building permit granted for the project was appealed to the Board of Appeal for Environment and Natural Resources, and the board ruled that the permit was invalid because the project was not in accordance with the zoning plan and the notification to the neighbors was insufficient.
Reykjavíkurborg started the zoning process and completed it with an announcement in Stjórnartíðindum in July last year.
That scheme was also challenged and the committee struck it down in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit, and the owners of the house were back at square one.
By this time, the house had fallen into disrepair and the neighbours were getting tired of it.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation, the answers were varied.
Some understood the owners' intentions, others did not.
Some directed their anger at the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily at anyone in particular.
Others said the parking spaces were a headache, but neighbors have been using the unused parking spaces of Dunhaga 18-20 for their vehicles.
One complainant in the case said he was tired of the bureaucracy:
To have to go through the process three times is unbelievable.
It's as if Reykjavíkurborg doesn't know how to read."
Today the house stands empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the ephemeral city administration and the owner's and many years of work now at the beginning.
When a reporter arrived at Dunhaga 18, he was greeted by open doors and a pile of garbage.
A Playstation console and a recent television lay among other rubbish on the ground - victims of Icelandic summer heat.
The old office of Háskólaprent was open, and there were a lot of cats from the smell of it.
It is clear that someone has taken up residence in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few shelves of geological field notebooks, presumably destined for a book, loomed.
The stairwells of the apartment building were also open and full of life.
The reporter was fortunate enough to run into a resident of the other one.
The Romanians were cooking a potato dish for dinner and invited the reporter in.
The Romanians work for the employment agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and, according to DV, the company has not paid for the premises except for heating and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not justifiable to charge rent.
From the mailboxes in the hallway of the house, it is clear that a number of foreign workers have lived there in recent months.
Staffing agencies have not been immune to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, as the downturn in tourism has led to a downturn in the construction sector, and these two sectors have been the most prolific users of staffing agencies.
Nonetheless, the residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do and hung their work clothes and gloves in the common area to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the dilapidated state of the house, the apartment that the boys shared appeared to be well maintained.
When the reporter said goodbye to the Romanian boys, the irony suddenly hit him: In the best place in Reykjavík, a 1,500-square-meter property is falling apart.
The owners want to improve the house and the neighbors want to improve the condition, but they disagree on the definition of "improvement."
In the middle sits the city's planning department, a victim of endless appeals and complaints in the planning process and a slow-moving Environmental Board of Appeal.
The house is then inhabited by Romanian workers, perhaps the very ones who will improve the situation when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article originally appeared in DV's weekend edition on July 17.
In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will pledge 10 million pounds to tackle obesity, including a ban on junk food advertising, in the wake of his serious illness, in part linked to his weight.
Johnson is expected to launch the campaign, which has been given the name Better Health, on Monday, but doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling to overweight patients and a drive to increase the number of cycle paths will also be launched.
Adverts for fast food outlets will also be banned on TV before 9pm, according to reports.
COVID-19 has shone a spotlight on the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the PM is determined we must use this time to get healthier, more active and eat more healthily, a spokesman said.
Johnson himself has struggled with weight issues, being hospitalized in the spring when he contracted the coronavirus, and his weight is believed to have contributed to his serious illness.
Women better suited to lead change
She said the new constitution was the biggest step the nation could take towards greater devolution, transparency and tackling corruption.
We need to change gear a little bit now and who better to lead that change than the group of society who find it easier to be in those values.
It's women," said Helga.
Women in Iceland are famous for their women's solidarity.
Standing together to lead change.
So now it's up to us to lead these changes."
She said she was a little worried about the focus on Iceland as "the best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
Then we are not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
As the Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
There's a lot.
We have to know where we come from and know our history and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don't all live by the same rules here," said Helga.
Asked, she said that women were in many ways in a good position in Iceland, but added that, like in many other places, Icelanders lived with very masculine values.
Politics, she said, was about self-interest, domination and power, the forces that perpetuated injustice in all societies.
Women have now set up this group and come together and are just getting a little bit frustrated that Parliament keeps ignoring this referendum from 2012," she said.
It's these feminine values that we're thinking about.
From human rights and environmental protection, cooperation and the fact that we are all really sitting at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the cornerstones of the new constitution.
We are a very rich country in natural resources and it is crazy that people are living in poverty here.
It's ridiculous, we can do it differently," said Helga.
It is ridiculous that there is some natural law that women's jobs are always paid less.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to constantly fight for decent wages."

Tried to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after threatening a pedestrian and trying to steal money from him.
Police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbæ, where two people were arrested in connection with the case.
The police then stopped a motorcyclist in Hlíðunum, where the driver was travelling at 146 km/h where the speed limit is 60 km/h.
He had also previously been banned from driving.
Greater Manchester Police were kept busy overnight with more than 80 incidents recorded in the force's daily log between 5pm yesterday and 5am this morning.
There were also a lot of noise complaints about parties.
Eleven noisy parties were reported in the early hours of Saturday morning, which was a lot for the police log.
However, 22 noise complaints were reported to the police last night.
Six were detained overnight.
The police were called to Árbær last night when people were shooting off fireworks.
However, they were able to escape when police arrived.
Nine motorists were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Four people were arrested following a brawl in the city centre last night, one of whom was detained in a police cell.
Two were taken to the emergency room after falling on their faces, one in downtown and one in the West End.
One was taken to the emergency room after injuring himself jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who was towing a caravan in Kjalarnes yesterday.
The trailer's wheels, according to the police log, were in "very bad shape" and were impounded.
You can stay in Monet's house over the holidays
The house, where the Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life, is now available to rent on the website Airbnb.
The next available nights in the house are over the summer holidays.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If anyone intends to rent the house, they must rent it for at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb site, it's next available for a week over the Bank Holiday weekend, so it could be a good option for some holidaymakers.
The two nights over the bank holiday weekend cost only 964 US dollars or about 130,000 Icelandic krónur, according to Fréttablaðið.
Dozens in quarantine, some showing symptoms of coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days, and most of them are unrelated.
Dozens have been quarantined and some have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three people were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday and two at the border.
An expert at the Directorate of Health says that the increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in the community.
It has been sequenced from the previous domestic case and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no reason to believe that it has been circulating in the community for some time.
This is probably something new to the country, but of course we need to be very vigilant now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert at the Public Health Agency.
Most of those infected have been in contact with people who came from abroad.
Further testing is planned in the coming days, but some who came into contact with the infected are already showing symptoms of the coronavirus.
Now there is no influenza in circulation and there is less of other respiratory infections, so we can be a bit more relaxed about doing these tests on people who would have been tested for something else first during the influenza season," said Kamilla.
Contact tracing is mostly complete, but it is not ruled out that more people will have to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected had attended sporting events.
This has raised questions about whether it is appropriate to hold such events.
Emergency management's communications manager says it's very possible as long as people follow guidelines and regulations.
Kamilla says it is almost impossible for the infected to have been infected at the sporting events.
If more people don't go into isolation after having been in contact with these individuals after these sporting events, then we can say that our measures at the events have worked.
But we don't know yet," said Kamilla.
The procedures of the Civil Protection Department are constantly being reviewed.
We need to be ready to step in with further advice or restrictions if necessary," Kamilla said.
After just over a week, restrictions are set to be eased to allow gatherings of up to 1,000 people.
This new position could affect the easing of restrictions.
‘A certain meditation to cooking’ - See Elísabet Vigfúsdóttir's menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is a football star and plays for Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a nutritionist.
She needs a lot of energy for the hustle and bustle of the day and usually takes the time to cook a good and nutritious meal.
A normal day for me starts by going to work around eight in the morning," says Elísa.
After work, I go to the grocery store to prepare dinner before picking up my daughter from preschool around 3 p.m.
Elsa finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter from daycare early.
It's good to have time with her before I go to practice later.
After practice, it's nice to come home and just have to heat up dinner.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to empty our minds."
Elísa does not follow any particular diet.
She is in the final stages of her master's thesis in nutrition and knows well what she needs to eat to have enough energy to work, study, family and training.
What works for me is eating a varied diet that is well balanced with protein, carbohydrates and fat.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not to label food as good or bad, rather nutritious or non-nutritious.
It's okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time."
Elísa is very interested in cooking.
There's something meditative about standing in the kitchen and cooking, and I really enjoy that.
I have to say that my confidence is in the kitchen and I truly believe that I am a good cook."
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, left in almond milk overnight.
Top off this meal with whatever is available.
Often it is banana and crunchy muesli & COFFEE.
I'm a big coffee drinker.
Snacks: Extremely variable, but fruits or vegetables, flatbreads, plain yogurt with banana and muesli, sandwiches, and I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if that's what's available.
Lunch: I often make all sorts of hearty salads out of what's in the fridge, quinoa or bulgur, falafel balls, arugula, roasted vegetables with a good dressing.
If the schedule goes completely out the window (which it often does) then the egg slicer at work has come to my rescue on more than one occasion, and then it's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and a boiled egg for me.
Snack: Eat something carbohydrate-rich before training, bread with toppings, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often on the menu at my house, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle
Seattle city officials in Washington state have declared a state of civil emergency following widespread protests in the city's downtown.
Police used tear gas and stun grenades yesterday in an attempt to clear a large area occupied by protesters that stretched across several city blocks near the Capitol.
Police tweeted that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into vandalism at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly involving some kind of explosive device.
City and police officials say protesters threw rocks, bottles, fireworks and other debris at police, injuring one officer who was taken to a hospital.
However, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
They were called to show solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there have been repeated clashes between protesters and heavily armed federal agents.
There, as in other cities across the United States, people have gathered under the banner of Black Lives Matter, remembering George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding change.
Not revoked until after the vote
It is still not known whether the dismissals of Icelandair's flight attendants, which are due to take effect next month, will be revoked.
Electronic voting on the Icelandair flight attendants' collective agreement will end at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the union's chairman, is certain that Icelandair will not make a decision about the layoffs until the outcome of the vote is known.
This definitely hangs together, says Guðlaug Líney.
No redundancies have been withdrawn, this needs to be sorted out so that we can man the aircraft.
Of course, people are impatient to know whether they will have work after the end of the month."
A vote is being held on a deal that was signed a week ago, in the early hours of July 19.
It is expected to last until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that flight attendants had previously voted down.
On July 17, the board and executive committee of the Icelandic Flight Attendants' Association approved a general strike at Icelandair, which was approved by the members in a vote.
She never came, but it was decided in the wake of Icelandair's decision to end negotiations with the Flight Attendants' Association, to dismiss all of its flight attendants and seek a collective bargaining agreement with another trade union.
Then, the airline's pilots were to temporarily take on the role of security guards on board.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it's hard to say.
People are hurting after Icelandair's attack, when all of the airline's flight attendants were laid off and told they would be negotiating with another union.
Now we'll see if it makes a difference," she says.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair at the end of April, but 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
Their notice period varies, for those with the shortest service it is three months and ends in the month of July-August.
This group includes about 90% of Icelandair flight attendants.
What happens if the deal is not approved?
We are seeking further talks with our counterparts.
This agreement meets the demands of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that flight attendants feel they have been pushed too far."
Voting on collective agreement ends, Icelandair to announce second quarter results tomorrow
Voting by flight attendants on a new contract will end at noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's second-quarter results will also be published tomorrow, but interim results suggest that the company's revenue has fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
Electronic voting on the collective agreement between the Icelandic Flight Attendants Association and Samtök atvinnulífsins for Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends on Monday, July 27, at noon.
Those eligible to vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay union dues to the Flight Attendants Association.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective bargaining agreement in the early hours of Sunday, July 19, after Icelandair broke off negotiations with the union on Friday after flight attendants rejected a previous agreement in a vote at the beginning of July.
Icelandair had previously sacked all of its flight attendants and cabin crew on Friday, but they were reinstated after a new collective bargaining agreement was signed.
Under the new contract, flight attendants will have to work five more hours a month for the same base pay.
The collective bargaining agreement is valid until 2025, and it has integrated provisions for pilots and flight attendants on how long they can work on one shift.
The agreement was presented to FFÍ members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, and many flight attendants who spoke to the news agency then expressed their dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Most seemed to agree that the agreement had to be accepted to keep the FFÍ alive.
Icelandair will announce its second-quarter results tomorrow, and the company's EBIT, its operating profit before financial items and taxes, is negative by 100 to 110 million US dollars or 1.5 billion Icelandic krona, according to preliminary results.
Icelandair sent a provisional calculation to the stock exchange last Wednesday, where it said that the company's revenue amounted to 60 million dollars in the quarter or about 8.3 billion ISK.
Available cash and equivalents were $154 million at the end of the quarter, or approximately ISK 21 billion.
Icelandair is also planning an IPO in August.
Icelandair is aiming to finalise agreements with 15 lenders, the government and Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, before the end of the month ahead of a share offering.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
A new virus just means it was an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been brewing domestically," says Már Kristjánsson, head of the infectious diseases department at Landspítalinn, about the news that "a new type of virus" has been detected in Iceland.
Three domestic cases were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One of those who tested positive had taken part in the Rey Cup football tournament, but the source of the infection is unknown and contact tracing is ongoing.
In addition, a case was detected in an individual who arrived in the country on July 15, and two who were in contact with him have begun to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, a case was detected that is related to the case reported yesterday, and after sequencing at deCODE genetics, a "new type of virus that has not been detected before" was found.
Contact tracing is complete in relation to that case.
Már points out that this is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread all over the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to talk about a new variant of that virus rather than a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could say anything about the start of a second wave of the epidemic, Már says that, as things stand, it is a single case and it may be that nothing more will come of it.
But on the other hand, if there are cases in the country that are not connected abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then it would be possible to draw the conclusion [about a second wave] but it is premature at the moment, Már explains.
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to Icelandic happiness hidden in the hot tubs?
BBC programme makers lead viewers to the conclusion in a funny video which shines a light on the nation's pool and spa culture.
Icelandic bathing culture is unique in the world and it is claimed that there are more baths per capita in Iceland than anywhere else in the world.
The natural hot springs are the basis, but also the tradition of swimming here.
Swimming lessons for children were made compulsory in 1940, but older citizens are no less keen to take advantage of the hot water for their health.
Swimming is described as a fixed part of the general welfare of the nation.
Everyone is equal in the pot, regardless of class or status.
Free from mobile phones, people talk on a personal level about home and away or enjoy the soothing power of water: meditating and recharging the soul and body.
100 days to go until the election
There are 100 days until Americans go to the polls and elect a president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he faces an uphill battle.
Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has a wide lead over Trump nationally, according to polls.
According to a new AP poll, a record number of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the new coronavirus pandemic is also very unpopular, and more Americans than ever believe that the president has handled the economy badly.
Specifically, only two in ten Americans say the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they approve of Trump's handling of the pandemic and 48 percent say he has handled the economy well.
It was 56 percent in March and 67 percent in January.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden has 49.9 percent of the national vote while Trump has 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention away from his handling of the pandemic to Biden, stoking so-called culture wars and promising a law-and-order agenda.
Biden's campaign, however, is making a concerted effort to keep the focus on Trump and believes it has a good chance of winning if the election is really about how Trump has done his job over the past four years.
Trump's unpopularity also appears to be dragging down Republican lawmakers, and Democrats are even hoping to gain a majority in the U.S. Senate, which had previously been considered highly unlikely.
Politico reported last week that if the parties and candidates were to maintain their current levels of support, the Republican Party would suffer its worst defeat in decades.
The suburbs have proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 general election, and it looks like that trend will continue.
Trump has in recent days sought to scare suburban voters into following him, including by saying that if Biden were to become president, he would destroy suburbs across the United States and stoke racial divisions.
Among other things, Trump has scrapped an Obama-era rule designed to increase diversity in suburbs.
He then urged "suburban housewives" in the United States to read an op-ed by a former New York deputy secretary of state, who argued that Biden would destroy the suburbs, which Trump endorsed.
Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American Dream.
I will keep it, and even make it better!" the president said.
Suburban Americans are an ever-growing voting bloc.
According to NPR, they are half of all American voters.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has won a majority of this group's votes has become president.
With the exception of 2012, when Mitt Romney received a majority of the vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that despite Trump winning a narrow majority in the suburbs in 2016, his support there has dropped significantly.
While the polls vary, Biden has been ahead of Trump by about 15 percentage points in recent weeks.
Regis Philbin has died
American television personality Regis Philbin has died, aged 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, host, announcer, and singer for over six decades.
He is perhaps best known for co-hosting the popular talk show Live! with Regis from 1988 to 2011, alongside Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has also hosted shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has spent the most hours on American television and has been recognized as such.
He won six Emmy Awards during his career and was nominated a total of 37 times.
According to a statement from his family, Philbin died of natural causes.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have paid tribute to him on social media in the last 24 hours.
Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision was made to postpone the Olympics, an event that has only been disrupted by world wars until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said the famous Olympic flame would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," referring to the coronavirus pandemic that the world is going through together.
Athletes have an extra year to prepare and officials in Japan are footing the bill for the delay.
Everyone keeps their head, however, as a lot is at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for this year's Olympics, the cheers of the Japanese delegation were genuine.
They cried and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to host the games in 2016 but lost out to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan would bask in the world's attention.
The games were originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August but have been postponed for a year and will now start on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If it is not possible to hold the games then, if the coronavirus is still a major threat, the games will be cancelled.
But no one wants to think that thought to the end.
The Olympics are no ordinary sporting event.
Nothing is spared, the show must always be spectacular and strive to top the last one.
The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the evaluation of the cities' presentations by the selection committee.
The more impressive the presentation, the greater the chance of winning the prize.
Tokyo spent $150 million to try to get the 2016 Olympics, or about 200 billion yen.
For the second time, when bidding for the 2020 games, 75 million dollars, about 10 billion króna, was put into the campaign.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the games this year, the Japanese government had already spent 30 billion ISK on the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build an Olympic village, venues and generally strengthen the country's infrastructure to host such an event, prepare for it and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which would have been underway this week but was postponed for a year because of the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, in a report released by the Japanese Audit Board at the end of last year, it was revealed that the cost was actually double that figure.
It is likely that the cost of postponing the games will not be fully known, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars on top of the original cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could range from $15 billion to $30 billion.
The numbers are so high that all the tax revenue of the Icelandic state would barely cover half an Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympics are an event of that magnitude that they have often been the subject of economists, who try to crunch the numbers and look at the benefits and costs of hosting the games.
In short, a lot of people seem to have come to the conclusion that the economic effects of the Olympics are far from positive for the cities that host them.
There are some short-term effects, such as a large increase in jobs for a short period of time, but in the long term, cities are often left with a debt burden and high operating costs for little-used infrastructure.
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is saddled with significant debt from the 2016 Games and has struggled to maintain the large sports venues built for the Games.
Analysis of figures after the London 2012 Games revealed that only 10 per cent of those who got jobs linked to the Olympics in the city were previously unemployed.
This means that there were not many new jobs created.
In general, cities have not fared particularly well financially from hosting the Olympics because of the crushing cost of the infrastructure built for the games.
However, the benefits are often said to lie in increased tourist traffic visiting the Olympic cities after the games, although there is much uncertainty about the 2021 games.
It is also unclear whether it will be possible to accommodate the usual number of spectators.
The main thing, though, is the honour of being chosen, which is hard to put a price on.
Indeed, despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy the Games bring is not something that can be put a price on.
But while the show is often spectacular and nothing is spared, this is not just about money.
It is the sporting heroes who are in the spotlight.
For some athletes, the postponement is a blessing in disguise.
Australian five-time Olympian and gold medallist in her event at the 2016 Games, Chloe Esposito, is also pregnant and would have missed out on this summer's action but is hopeful of being in peak form for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are quite happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who had planned to retire after this year's games, the postponement means that some of them will now retire before the games take place.
They simply don't trust their bodies to go through another year of intense training.
Few athletes captured the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics quite like gymnast Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold medals and one bronze.
Biles has done a number of interviews in her native United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She's aiming for the 2021 Olympics, but she's not sure if she'll still be at the top of her game by then, as she'll be 24 by then.
While it is generally not considered a high age, it is above average for an elite gymnast.
It's a sensitive subject," Biles said, smiling, in an interview published on the IOC's Instagram account when asked if she hopes to match her haul from the 2016 Rio Games.
I don't even know if I'm going to be on top after another year of training," Biles said.
She has previously spoken about how her body can no longer cope with the demands of gymnastics.
Nonetheless, she is training hard for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop training when the pandemic was at its peak and the gym was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles any more than there were for anyone else while all athletic facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold medals couldn't buy her any more access than anyone else, she had to find other ways to stay in shape like everyone else.
The basic form is certainly better than most people.
We have a busy schedule now.
It was hard to start training again after the gym reopened.
We started slowly but we're back up to full speed and I'll be increasing my training gradually as the year goes on.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will be or if they will be held, but we are training as if they will be, we can't do anything else.
I've put in too much work to walk away from the sport now," Biles said.
As with her, and others, there is a nagging doubt or perhaps more of an awareness that the games might not be held at all in 2021.
But predicting it is impossible.
Nobody knows how the COVID-19 pandemic will be in July 2021 and there is nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics as if they will be held a year from now.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Wedding postponed due to pandemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was set to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
I think there are more important things to think about right now," the actress told People.
We definitely want to get married one day and have our dream wedding and have all our loved ones there.
But we decided to put it on hold and focus on what's important right now, which is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I'm more focused on world affairs than wedding plans these days.
There's a lot going on and we need to focus on what's happening in the world."
