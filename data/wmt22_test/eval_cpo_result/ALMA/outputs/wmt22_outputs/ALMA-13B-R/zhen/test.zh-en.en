Zhejiang University Academic Conference: Students Sing the Lead Role, Research Results Make People's Imaginations Run Wild - Xinhuanet
Using air to wash hands, holding one's breath to diagnose diseases, and accurately searching for the source of smog—these were some of the creative academic achievements recognized at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University last night.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers a wide range of fields, including the environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. From a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with practical applications, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biological sensors: your home health care doctor
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biological sensor for smartphones at the scene, which was only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to take a light breath, and this device can initially detect your health status by analyzing the components of the air you exhale."
Zhang Diming introduced that this sensor is connected to a smartphone, and the health report will appear on the phone after exhaling the gas.
Smartwatches that can detect health conditions available on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biological sensor uses the new material graphene, which targets chemical elements. Its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the state of one's health.
Smart surgical lights: the surgeon's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights have also been introduced in the operating theater.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss International Invention Exhibition in Geneva this year.
Zhu Linjing and Xin Junfeng's team of graduate students from the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up a new path by identifying the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and inventing the intelligent LED surgical headlight.
"Many diseases are detected and removed too late, and this is related to the lighting used in the surgeon's operating room."
For example, during early cancer screening, if the doctor cannot clearly see all the tumor tissues in time, the cancer cells will still spread later, said Xin Junfei.
This smart surgical lamp has four light panels that adjust the spectrum to enhance the contrast between different tissues under lighting.
During the surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowlessness of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal preferences at any time.
This smart surgical light has been tested in hospitals such as the Shaohua Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air is both water-saving and cool
Ordinary people just wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap on them, squeeze some hand sanitizer, but Li Qichang and his classmates invented an "air washing device".
As soon as we step onto the apparatus's sink, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the water tap, and combines with the water.
This way, we can wash our hands clean! "
The colorimetric reaction and bacterial residue test proved that the cleaning effect achieved by this method is the same as that of conventional handwashing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, and it can ensure cleaning quality while saving 90% of water. The entire process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.

A very meaningful certificate—the first aid certificate
This is one of the other important skill certificates besides my driver's license!
Just a reminder: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures to be carried out before an ambulance arrives, in the event of an emergency.
It is well known that it takes some time for the ambulance to arrive after an accident, and this is the most critical period.
This is the time when emergency care is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a brain hemorrhage, or cardiac arrest, then our window of life would only be four minutes, golden four minutes!
So it's so important for people around you to know first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to help them, rather than just standing there helplessly doing nothing, which is a terribly scary feeling.
In China, we have official data showing that 3 million people die each year from accidents, and the most dangerous is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved nationwide.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, about 70% to 80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This is what the founder of the First Reaction, Lu Le, said.
If a person has a heart attack and stops breathing, and their heart stops beating, squeezing the chest is useless.
Only artificial respiration and chest compression can save a person.
I found that we still have very few people who are aware of the need to learn first aid, but by the time something happens, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond quickly when faced with emergencies.
It might even save someone's life!
You can register for first aid training at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students get a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before I turned 25, and adding the first aid certificate to the list of goals was something I did a few months ago, but I really did achieve it!
Next, I need to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate, and I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving emergency rescue certificate. To take this certificate, you need to have a first aid certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually quite useful!

Let me start with the conclusion: I personally think that Four Seas is a complete failure of a film, in every sense of the word.
But you can't say that this movie is not a highlight either, at least the music selection is pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, and one of them is the kind that makes you fall asleep comfortably in the theater, while another is the kind that makes you feel indignant after watching it. Four Seas is like the monkeys on Mount Emei to the audience: it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly a genius.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems like a creation from a Kafka novel, incomprehensible and full of holes, just like the windbreaker on Ma Kao's body.
Even after watching it, you will wonder whether there is a director's hidden metaphor in there, but when you think about it carefully, you realize that it's just a big pile of shit.
I will first explain some of the more difficult plot points for me to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the southern part of the country, depending on his grandmother for survival.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and the plot then arranged for one of the neighbors, an old man, to drive a small bread van to take her to the northeast to see the snow.
Old people in their 80s traveling in a minibus from the south to the northeast to see snow?
He and his dad are very confident about this.
Then the old man disappeared without a trace.
How did the female lead's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the gang of bikers on the island easily block off a stretch of mountain road?
Then a truck carrying steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and there was no one to be found around it, not even the truck driver.
The props are too obvious, aren't they?
Why would a delinquent with a bad credit record and a criminal suspicion become a police auxiliary?
Why don't people report high-interest loans? In the movie, the police even asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door in a hotel, and then arranges to stay in a room without the hotel owner's permission, sleeping outside the door overnight?
This nonsensical plot pervades the entire film, and it is so ridiculous that I feel painful when I recall them.
Apart from the plot, the worst thing about the film is its theme, or rather, that the film has no theme at all and is just a repulsive patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the film, you think he wants to make a comedy, but 20 minutes later, you guess it might be an inspirational film, and halfway through, you think it might be a film that wants to depict the struggles of small-town youth, and by the end, you have no idea what you just watched, followed by a deep sense of self-doubt as to why you went to the theater on New Year's Day.
For most people, they are also quite familiar with the formulas of all kinds of movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then it should be inspirational and comedic, and then tell the audience how a talented novice achieves success step by step.
If you want to make a romantic film, then you should tell the story of the love-hate entanglements between the motorcycle-loving town youth and the waitress girls.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot contain things that contradict the normal world.
(For example, the character played by Yin Zheng, who just had his new motorcycle burned, and then he can still sing) we cannot go to open some brain holes that even Kennedy could not withstand.
As for the female lead, she was clearly not mentally challenged, but she behaved like a five-year-old in some ways, and I really don't know whether this was due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
There is another thing that I can't quite understand. Why is Han Han, as a race car driver, so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Why would such a film be scheduled for the Chinese New Year holiday, to give audiences a headache?

Equipment for the production and processing of concrete modules for inspection wells  Introduction to equipment for the production and processing of brick modules for well walls in Zhengzhou:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection well module brick machinery, inspection well block machinery, and wall body module machinery for inspection wells, with semi-automatic to fully automatic production lines.
Through years of practice and development, it now has a solid reputation for producing high-quality hydraulic, mobile, and fully automated well inspection systems and their accessories.
Check well concrete module production and processing equipment  Assembly site of Zhenzhou well wall brick module equipment:
Check well concrete module production and processing equipment, the characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou brick module equipment for well walls:
Yixin Checking Well Block Machine equipment is widely applicable to new types of construction materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
For example, inspection wells, manholes, drains, gutters, septic tanks, and small structures such as bridges and retaining walls.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the upper, lower, left, and right sides of the modules are all in the form of grooves and ridges, which can be combined to form a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the wall body of the well shaft is far superior to the masonry construction of the planar friction surface.
The modules are hollow structures, and after being combined and built up, the vertical holes are connected, the horizontal holes are interconnected, and after the core is poured, a precast concrete network structure is formed, which serves as secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The modules are equipped with slots for reinforcing bars both horizontally and vertically, which increases the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete check well module blocks are not easily prone to collapse, subsidence, leaks, and other phenomena. The mechanical properties of the check well wall block modules are stable, and the operation is simple. The formed dimensions are standard.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with an intelligent control system that is equipped with data input and output devices, a one-touch touchscreen liquid crystal display, and a monitoring system that monitors the entire mechanical operation process. It realizes ideal human-machine interaction, automatic material analysis, density operation, safety logic control, and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the shaft wall panel adopts a single-cylinder hydraulic transmission system and a double-cylinder hydraulic transmission system.
The independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the impact of vibration on the hydraulic system caused by the main machine, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment feeding box moves forward, the mold box is demolded, the hopper door is closed, and the pallets are automatically conveyed, all of which are completed independently by the hydraulic system, thereby reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment uses imported computers and electrical components, as well as seals and hydraulic components, and its overall performance is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform of the well wall panel is made of a whole steel plate, and the table surface is cut with a laser to fit without welding points, allowing the filler box to freely swing and guide, thus effectively reducing mechanical wear.
By reducing the mold load, filling the material and integrating and synchronizing the vibration amplitude, we ensure that the compaction effect is achieved by means of integral, synchronous, table vibration, mold vibration.
The wall body modules of the well shaft are mechanically vibrated by a mechanical vibrator and controlled by a computer to adjust the amplitude according to the cost-benefit ratio of the raw materials, with no wear and tear braking, thus extending the service life and reducing costs.
The wall modules of the well shaft have both mechanical automatic control and manual control functions.

Chongqing Vocational Schools Pilot Modern Apprenticeship System - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Bureau that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools. Students who are accepted for the pilot training will simultaneously hold the status of apprentices. After enrollment, they will be pre-hired as employees by the pilot enterprises.
The Education Bureau requires that the enrollment and selection procedures for vocational middle schools be standardized, and that the status of apprentices as both students of vocational middle schools and employees of enterprises be clarified. According to the principle of mutual selection, apprentices, vocational middle schools, and enterprises should sign a three-party agreement, and for apprentices under the age of 16 who have not yet reached the age of 18, a four-party agreement should be signed by the apprentice, guardian, vocational middle school, and enterprise to determine the rights and obligations of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and rights protection of the apprentice during on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and jointly conduct pre-employment training and job-switching training with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools must reform their talent cultivation models.
The school and the enterprise jointly designed a talent training plan, jointly formulated professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, mentor standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program has a study period of one pilot cycle, and the internship time for students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan. On-the-job training generally lasts for six months.
In practice, enterprises should implement the enterprise team-based management model. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead two to five apprentices to form a learning group, ensuring that students master the skills required for each rotational training post thoroughly.
According to the plan, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has determined 60 municipal vocational modern apprenticeship pilot schools in three batches, with each school having around 50 students, and a total of around 3,000 students (apprentices) to be trained.
According to the principle of first piloting and then implementation, from a point to a whole, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated cultivation of students by schools and enterprises, which will effectively improve students' occupational skills and increase their employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Omicron is highly contagious but mostly causes mild symptoms
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus are less severe than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly.
According to a report by the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the South African province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but no one has needed hospitalization yet.
Pile said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes older patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall seriously ill from coronavirus infection anyway.
He said that compared to the previous Delta wave, the COVID-19 patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people will have to be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks had severe symptoms, half the proportion of those with severe symptoms in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared to 20% in the early cases in South Africa.
William Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports to say, "At present, almost all the signs indicate that this is a relatively mild disease."
He also said, "It's still early, and we need to get more data in the later stages.
In general, hospitalization and death occur at a later time, and we only entered this wave of the epidemic two weeks ago.  ”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while also testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the dominant coronavirus variant worldwide, Omicron cases are now appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases discovered in Hoden Province during the first week of December increased by 400%. Tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Commentary: What can be done to save kidnapped children?
If we compare the famous public service slogan "No Buying, No Kidnapping" to the current situation where there is no demand for "rescue trafficking," then, in an environment where there is group prevention and all-out anti-trafficking efforts, trafficking will become unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes will not continue to occur.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency platform for reporting missing children.
This is an Internet information platform established to establish an authoritative channel for disseminating information about missing children, and to quickly recover kidnapped children.
Upon hearing that the app is called "Reunion," I felt a warmth in my heart.
The new technological means are not only named "artistic" and full of emotion, but also properly applied to informationization, which is practical and effective.
Anti-trafficking enforcement is primarily aimed at recovering kidnapped children, protecting their safety and freedom.
Next comes the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment can be described in many "big words" from individual punishment to social prevention and legal education.
However, before the trafficking case is solved, the safety of the victims should be the primary concern.
The urgency of the situation varies, and under the urgent "rescue" goal, controversial and disputed topics such as "whether selling children should be punishable by death" can be put aside temporarily for careful discussion, but the rescue of kidnapped children cannot wait.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to quickly leaving the scene of the crime after they have succeeded.
Every minute of delay in the search for a missing child means the child is one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case increases by one degree.
In this case, taking direct and effective measures such as the "Family Reunion" platform to solve cases and recover children is indeed a practical action.
After all, "combating trafficking" is a major task that requires the entire legal system to be put into operation.
To combat crime, protect the rights of children and parents, and ensure the effectiveness of legislation, the judiciary, and enforcement, we must always adhere to the principle of "protecting the young and the weak."
In addition, prevention of child trafficking can be improved from the family to the social level.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at the train station, and the parents fall asleep. When they wake up, they realize that the child is missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a reasonable awareness of protection.
Taking turns to rest and keeping children under safe protection are at least the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
From the perspective of law enforcement cracking down on child trafficking, the other side that purchases trafficked children should also be paid attention to and punished.
Individual criminal acts are often just a link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of China's Criminal Law, the statutory punishment for the crime of trafficking in children is a minimum of five years in prison; in cases of particularly severe circumstances, the punishment may be death, and the offender's property may be confiscated.
The starting point for sentencing is high, and the maximum sentence is severe, in the context of the trend toward "light punishment," the crime of child trafficking is obviously one of the more serious offenses.
However, there are still many cases of trafficking that occur every year to this day.
It can be seen that some people have outdated views on raising children, and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for this group should be carried out simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on strict enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" for kidnapping is widespread, kidnappers are motivated by greed, and constantly innovate their kidnapping methods, a situation of "dueling" with law enforcement will inevitably arise, and anti-kidnapping operations will inevitably become ineffective.
Therefore, breaking down outdated ideas and promoting legal awareness can also help to eradicate the crime of trafficking and buying children.

Draw strength from the Party's century-long struggle to forge ahead

Yang Haodong, from the perspectives of ideals and missions, self-revolution and youth, party leaders and party theory, etc., combined with his own insights and personal experiences, he elaborated on the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the conference in a comprehensive and systematic manner, from three aspects: ideals and missions, self-revolution and youth, and party leaders and party theory.
He pointed out that it is necessary to combine the spirit of the plenary session with the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech and important instructions to the people of Hunan, the spirit of the Hunan Provincial Party Congress, and study them together, integrating them, so as to enhance the consciousness, political awareness, and action awareness of defending the "two establishments" and upholding the "two safeguards," and move forward unswervingly along the direction indicated by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprises, and youth asked questions about the relationship between the three historic resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the "two establishments", how cultural enterprises can grasp the direction, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the party's 100-year struggle history. Yang Haodong answered each question in plain language and with vivid examples, and he exhorted young party members to draw strength from the party's 100-year struggle history to unite closely around the Party Central Committee and march forward with unwavering conviction. They should use their youth to fulfill their responsibilities and obligations.

The International Olive Oil Council classifies olive oil into two major categories, namely, virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), with five grades.
Virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is obtained by mechanical cold pressing and filtering the oil from fresh olive fruits after removing impurities.
They can be divided into three levels according to the acidity:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil of the highest grade and quality is the highest level and purest form of olive oil.
The taste is exquisite, with a delicate and soothing plant fragrance and acidity below 1%.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil of High Quality (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly higher, but does not exceed 2%, and the taste is pure and fragrant.
Ordinary Virgin Extra Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity is less than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil that has been refined from virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or "secondary oil".
Extra virgin olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Common olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of extra virgin olive oil to blend the flavor and color, and its acidity is less than 1.5%, with a transparent pale golden color.
Refined olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): It is a refined olive oil obtained by extraction from olive pomace using solvents, and then purified.
If you have looked at the classification of olive oils, you should have noticed that acidity is a very important indicator.
You should know that olive fruits are just like grapes used to make wine, which come from different regions and different varieties of olive fruits to produce olive oil of different standards.
The best place for olive trees to grow is:
The coastal areas of the Mediterranean have the most suitable soil, temperature, sunlight, humidity, and rainfall conditions for the growth of olive trees.
Outside the Mediterranean coast, it can only be sparsely planted in suitable areas in other regions.
Major production areas and regions (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, all have climates similar to those of the Mediterranean region. There are also countries far south of the equator, such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on, with similar climates.
The harvesting season for olive oil:
From March to June each year, the olive tree flowers and bears fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and ripen, changing from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The fruit harvest season is from November to the following February (freshness of olive oil is quite important, you know).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as alpha-linolenic acid, linseed acid, vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit concluded, Biden said the flame of freedom will never be extinguished
The online "Democracy Summit" convened by US President Biden, which was attended by government and civil society leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of people all over the world, and dictatorial regimes can never extinguish it.
He also stated that the second Global "Democracy Summit" will be held next year.
On the second day of the summit, the representative of the Taiwanese government, Tang Feng, and the Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist currently residing in the UK, Law Gon-cong, also delivered speeches.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the task ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can face challenges, because as I said before, democracy is everywhere, as this conference has shown.
The dictatorial regime can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom; it burns in the hearts of people all over the world and across the globe.
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the collective efforts of the entire society.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the barriers of democracy, promote reform, and achieve transparent accountability, which will make us more resilient against the forces of authoritarianism and its shocks, as well as those who openly pursue power at the expense of the public interest."
The second day of the "Democracy Summit" had the themes of defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming the value of democracy.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day."
UN Secretary-General Guterres also stated in his opening speech on that day that the democratic cause is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges brought by the emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions, and the democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Leung Kwok-hung delivered a speech at the conference via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and other ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said, "For a long time, the world has been subjected to China's rise, but has failed to establish a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must collaborate.
We must use all the resources at our disposal (our resources) to ensure that the restoration of democracy is our top priority.
Rong Guangcong also called on the free world to unite to counter the threat posed by the CCP.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid of angering General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you haven't realized the threat posed by the CCP to our democratic values.
This is why we failed.
This is also the reason we need to change. 」
Tang Feng, Executive Yuan Deputy Minister Without Portfolio of Taiwan, delivered a video speech at a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Upholding Democratic Values," emphasizing that Taiwan is on the frontline in the fight against authoritarianism and dictatorship.
He also shared his experience of how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "At a time when democracy in Taiwan is flourishing, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and have also played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments in various regions have used public health and collective interests as a pretext to rationalize human rights violations, resulting in a global democratic regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without locking down the city, and we can defeat fake news without censorship.  ”
While the schedule for the "Democracy Summit" was being carried out on the second day, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that it had imposed sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, which were deemed to have seriously violated human rights, in accordance with the law. It also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was deemed to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the restaurant's spit-roasted chicken is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to practice at a price that's roughly the same.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendliness, and if you can't distinguish between them, the more expensive ones are usually friendlier than the cheaper ones, which are actually entry-level junk.
They are very weak, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. Hard balls cannot withstand it, and even experts find it difficult to control.
Their logic and subtext is: Tennis is so difficult, you know you won't be able to learn it, and you also know you don't want to spend a lot of money, so they can cheat you by selling you a cheap racket, you play with it a couple of times, and then you won't play anymore, so the racket is cheap and you don't feel bad about it.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you've progressed. Then come back here and buy the expensive stuff, and I'll make twice the money.
I suggest spending a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand racket that is in better condition. Choose a racket from Prince or Dunlop, as these brands are not very well known, so you can get a good racket at a low price. A new racket for 500 or 600 yuan is good enough, and a second-hand one for 200 yuan gives you the enjoyment of a thousand-yuan racket, doesn't it?
It is quite friendly to beginners, but it becomes useless after the beginner stage, and most people, especially women, cannot get past the beginner stage.

In fact, there are many nuances to dressing and styling for girls who are slightly overweight.
Girls with a plump body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be just below the knee, covering the fat part of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the legs.
If it is too long, it will give the impression of being short and fat.
If you divide your outfit into three sections by wearing different colors for the top, skirt, and long socks, it will make you look taller naturally. The top, skirt, and long socks can be in different colors, which will give the impression of a slender figure.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for chubby girls (the author can attest to this), and dark colors are also a good way to hide excess weight. Black skirts, elegant and dignified, are also the first choice for chubby girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially a black mini skirt, will make you look thinner.
If your calves are very fat, your socks and shoes should not be too conspicuous.
The more popular it is, the better. The colors should not be too bright either.
This will prevent people from noticing your legs and feet, giving the impression of being overweight.
For slightly plump girls, it is important to teach them the tricks of stylish dressing.
Chubby girls should never wear tight-fitting short skirts. In addition, tops should not be too short or stuffed into the skirt, as this will make people feel very uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, you should wear black knee-high socks or mesh socks (the kind with a fine grid pattern, please), and choose a soft, flowing printed flared skirt. Pair it with a shirt with a turned-up collar to effectively cover up the shortcomings of chubby girls.
Of course, plump girls also need to be careful when wearing short skirts.
A plump girl should choose a top that matches the color of her short skirt, which will make her plump figure appear taller.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the hottest summer trend!
If you are a chubby upper body but slim legs MM, I recommend choosing a short dress with a glamorous feel.
Not only can it cover a big belly, but it can also show off your best features.
A-line skirts will make you look slimmer, so they are more suitable for plump girls. The top should be tighter-fitting to create a sense of layering, which will make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt is something that plump girls can also try.
Chubby girls can also dress fashionably.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing and styling, plump girls can also be the center of attention and attract everyone's attention.
After making changes to your wardrobe, you also need to exercise more in your daily life to get rid of the "chubby girl" label as soon as possible 😄

Xinhua Multi-Media Plus | Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League Fuels Winter Olympics Fever - Xinhua News Agency
On December 11, Beijing Dreaming ING team player Pang Yongtian (center) shoots during the game.
On that day, the 2021-2022 season Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League continued to compete in Beijing's major ice rinks.
This season is divided into the regular season and the playoffs. The participating athletes range in age from U6 to U18, and the categories are divided into competitive and selection groups, with a total of nearly 3,600 players from 256 teams across the city participating.
After more than ten years of development, the Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League has become a platform for young ice hockey enthusiasts in Beijing to exchange skills and make friends, and also provides excellent players for the Beijing youth and junior ice hockey teams.
The league's performance has played a role in promoting youth ice hockey in Beijing and igniting enthusiasm for ice hockey in the Winter Olympics, laying a foundation for the development of ice hockey in Beijing after the Winter Olympics.
Girl serves as a target for sister's fundraising: "At least it's just a flesh wound" - Xinhua.net
In Hangzhou Wulin Square, a girl stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "human target, 10 yuan per shot" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl willing to be a 'target' to raise funds for her sister" went viral on social media.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board that is slightly higher than her head at Hangzhou Wulin Square. The board is marked with the words "human target, 10 yuan per shot," indicating that passersby can pay to use a bow and arrow to shoot at it.
This behavior sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau Xiacheng Sub-Bureau Publicity Responsible Person confirmed to the reporter of Beijing News that the police have confirmed that the girl's actions were the result of fundraising for her sister, but such behavior is not to be encouraged. After being advised, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl street fundraiser "target" admonished
A photo circulating online shows a long-haired girl standing in the shape of a "U" in front of a large wooden board. The words "human target, 10 yuan per shot" are written in black ink on the board, and her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay account numbers are written on another board in front of her.
The photo caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this is "begging for attention," and there are also many netizens who sympathize with this.
"We discovered the situation around 10 a.m. on the 23rd when we patrolled the area near the square. There were already quite a few onlookers by then."
The police officers from the Tianshui Police Station in the vicinity of the incident site, who were interviewed by local media, said that there were two girls selling goods there, both of whom were around 20 years old and dressed in a youthful and stylish manner.
Among them, the girl who was the "human target" cried continuously, asking passersby to play the game for a while; the other girl stood by and shouted, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for surgery, and asking people to help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xihu District Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the reporter of Beijing Evening News that the girl's name is Jijiali, and she was collecting donations for her sister, Jijian.
However, because the treatment still requires over 300,000 yuan in expenses, we couldn't think of a good way to raise funds at the time, so we made this decision.
He said that throughout the process, two girls were involved: one was the target, and the other was responsible for delivering the blow, but neither of them was actually involved, and no one fired arrows during the process. The only thing they did was take pictures and post them on Weibo.
After the police investigated, it was determined that the bow and arrows used were not subject to regulation.
The official said, "We do not encourage this kind of fundraising that seeks to attract attention."
After being warned by the police at the police station, she has already left the station.
Heat dissipation: good; thinness: convenient; appearance material: satisfactory; Asus has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
It is stable in performance, and the four air outlets provide adequate heat dissipation. It is worth recommending.
This MSI Shadow Knight Dragon gaming laptop is quite good, with good workmanship and materials, and a reliable brand!
The Asus ROG Dragon is not too expensive in terms of price.
In my opinion, the MSI GE75 Raider Dragon is really good. Gaming performance: The gaming performance is smooth, allowing you to play most games comfortably. My PUBG runs at the highest FPS with a stable frame rate, which is very smooth, and LoL is no problem either. CSgo also runs smoothly. Most 3A games can be played on it.
Cooling performance: The cooling performance is quite good. The fan is quite powerful, and the work environment is quite quiet. The gaming performance is also quite good when the fan is set to full speed.
Appearance and material: The appearance is very cool and stylish, and the game itself is trendy. Display effect: The screen is very clear, and 1080p is enough for playing games
The laptop is not bad at all, I really think it's quite good. It's mainly used for design, and the price-performance ratio is very high. It's lighter than I imagined, and also looks better than I imagined. The red on my butt is the color of a very nice wine, not as garish as I imagined, and overall it's much better than I expected. It's a good buy, and it's also quite suitable for girls.
Two years ago, I started to get in touch with the Hengji Dark Knight. After two years, the price-performance ratio is quite high, and the quality is excellent!
I also recommend that my friends around me buy this product!
I have already purchased three machines from this series!
It looks good and has a good configuration
I bought it for my nephew, thinking that I would wait for the 418 Bank activity, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance, so I missed the big Bank activity, which is a bit of a pity.
However, it is quite cost-effective and the logistics are quite fast. Let's review it after some time.
A brand new, high-performance gaming laptop with a very good price-to-performance ratio that comes with Windows 11 and Office 2019 already installed. The design style is very good.
Display effect: I bought it for my child to use for 3D rendering, the software is already installed, and my child said that it can be used without any problems. This computer is capable of performing 3D design work.
He said it was good, the one he bought for his son.
The computer is quite good, especially the customer service attitude, which is very good. If you don't understand something, just ask, and I recommend buying it.
It's not bad, the game's graphics are really good
What was the hottest thing in 2021?
There is no doubt that it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
A recent article titled "Watch Out! Project Managers Can Win Gold Medals in These Olympic Events" was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and there is no one who can match them: moving bricks, going on business trips, and staying up late are all part of a project manager's daily routine, as are putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing.
A seemingly humorous article also reveals the daily hardships of project managers, reflecting a lack of enthusiasm for current project management work.
Project management personnel who are involved in the work are also gradually choosing to take some actions to escape the dilemmas of their work.
From the increasing number of people registering for PMP (certification for project management professionals recognized internationally), it can be seen that more and more project management professionals are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® candidates in China had reached nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified individuals was approximately 420,000, and the number of effective PMP® holders was approximately 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
Over the past decade, the number of PMP certified professionals has increased year by year, indicating that more and more project managers are realizing that relying on past "tried and true" methods is no longer viable. The ever-changing work environment has taught us that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the path forward.
However, does having a PMP certification guarantee that project management work runs smoothly?
Many project management novices say that by studying courses related to PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the knowledge points related to the ten areas of project management and the five process groups, but when it comes to actually performing project management work, they are still at a loss.
Many project managers often report the following problems: lack of awareness of project management, relying solely on personal experience, having a theoretical understanding of project management but not knowing how to put it into practice; lack of a systematic project management process framework, making it difficult to implement in practice, inaccurate project estimates, poor control and sensitivity, and projects dragging on and on; unclear division of labor among team members, and not knowing how to deal with "old hands" in the team; cross-departmental coordination is not smooth, making it difficult to advance the project ...

Jingxin urges consumers to engage in rational consumption ahead of "Double 12" - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
This year's "Double Eleven" shopping festival saw a record high of 1.77 trillion yuan in online payment transactions nationwide, surpassing previous years.
The multifarious discounts and coupons, and the livestream shopping that grabs people's attention, have once again made consumers exclaim that they have benefited greatly. At the same time, this wave of consumer enthusiasm not only makes people marvel at the ever-increasing consumer power of the nation, but also forces them to calm down and reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer groups of today.
Just before the arrival of "Double 12", Jietong Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jietong") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding the general public, especially the young people, to establish a good consumer awareness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in the financial consumption sector, but there are significant differences in their financial behavior and skills, and there is a need to further improve their basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy levels of the elderly and youth are relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of financial education in the future. The "China Young People's Debt Situation Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance show that the young generation has huge consumption potential. Credit consumption has become an important channel for consumption upgrading, and 86.6% of young people are using credit products. Nearly half of them have no debt accumulation, and the young generation as a whole presents a rational consumption trend, although it is quite different from the "excessive consumption" label attached to them by the outside world. However, some young people do indeed engage in excessive consumption and follow-the-crowd consumption, which has led to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even to the gradual increase of social problems. Financial institutions should have the courage to assume social responsibilities and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jietong has always been committed to providing high-quality, thoughtful services to help the people build their own happy lives, and has advocated for consumers to establish a positive and correct consumption view, and actively responded to regulatory calls by taking concrete actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people.
Over the past few years, JETCO has continuously carried out comprehensive and diverse financial literacy campaigns targeting the youth population, including university students, and has also launched various initiatives, such as innovation competitions in collaboration with top domestic universities, to subtly guide young people's consumption needs in a rational way, help them establish a rational consumption concept, and reasonably plan their consumption needs, thereby helping them accumulate wealth for their lifetime.
As Double 12 approaches, Jietong reminds all of its consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption mindset and a correct attitude toward money, to resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, to avoid the pitfalls of consumer borrowing, and to avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is necessary to plan ahead and spend within one's means to ensure timely repayment.
If you are late, the late payment record will be recorded in your personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on your future economic life, such as buying a car or a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose legitimate institutions and channels, and pay attention to verifying whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, Jietong will continue to leverage its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly update and iterate its financial products to provide consumers with more tailored and diversified services that better meet their needs. It will also continue to help the general public improve their financial knowledge and help consumers develop the concepts of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, becoming a trustworthy consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

Vietnam News Agency - Gulf Cooperation Council Faces Common Challenges Together
The stopover destinations of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since the beginning of the Gulf diplomatic crisis in mid-2017, when Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive ban on trade with it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations while having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the unity within the GCC, and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, where the member states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move toward "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are making efforts to restore relations with Qatar by first appointing new ambassadors to the two countries in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab countries have resolved their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar, which is based on the need to unite for the sake of the interests of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of both countries and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest 5 billion US dollars in Oman, and 13 cooperation memoranda of understanding worth 30 billion US dollars have been signed between the two countries' enterprises.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with Iran's negotiations with the world's major countries on the rescue of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an Iranian nuclear agreement that the Gulf Arab countries have criticized for being unable to resolve the issue of Iranian missiles.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "rival" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf countries believe that not addressing the Iranian missile issue and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region is a shortcoming.
In the context of the failure of the nuclear talks between the major countries and Iran to meet the wishes of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to prevent the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the end of some member states' disputes with Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, while also proposing measures to encourage its member states to fully cooperate in order to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Claiming to have the loudest supercar exhaust in the new town area!
This time, our team has brought a car that many men dream of!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago, the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, the annual road tax is several thousand ringgit, and it has four-wheel drive. Why is it called the LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
The editor doesn't know either, but according to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h. By the time the editor's myvi reaches 30 km/h, the other car has already reached 100 km/h. Hmm.
The low-slung body, the aggressive scissor doors, the massive air intakes all around the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine with a clear view of the glass below perfectly embody the Lamborghini style.
There is no need to say too much about the car models. Just Google it and you'll find what you need. Here, the editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not provide.
Being too much in the spotlight is uncomfortable. Everyone is watching wherever you go! (It's actually kind of fun.)
1km of fuel costs about RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
You should practice getting on and off the bike a bit, otherwise it can be a bit awkward (because you might not be able to get out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and you will instantly go deaf when you get out of the car (but it's still very cool).
The car is too big to fit in a regular parking space, and it's very narrow when parked, so I'm afraid of being hit when the car next to me opens its door!
It's a bit lonely because there are no competitors on the road (said by the editor himself, unrelated to the car owner, haha)
Please don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos of their beloved cars, please feel free to contact us!
More car information you didn't know is available at The Car Guide / People's Car Guide
It involves a crash worth millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are probably familiar to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of a Porsche 911 is in the millions!
Just before that day, a million-dollar supercar 911 and a ten-million-dollar supercar Chiron were knocked down in just a few minutes abroad!
The result proves that he was right!
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News Agency
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational ideals and value pursuits that have been accumulated and formed over the course of a university's development, and is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been of vital importance for the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, and society, as well as the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For Chinese universities, they arose in the autumn of national peril, and their spirit has been profoundly influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. They advocate the value concept of "moral cultivation for the benefit of the world, and rectification and pacification for the nation" and the nationalistic responsibility of "promoting education and strengthening the country."
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization in higher education is becoming increasingly apparent, and the global competition in education, technology, and talent is intensifying. As a major "supply side" of education, the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the "General Scheme for Comprehensive Promotion of Building World-Class Universities and World-Class Disciplines" has not only displayed the country's confidence and determination in moving from an education superpower to an education powerhouse, but has also raised higher and more innovative requirements for university development.
How can we make a concerted effort to join the ranks of the world's best in a relatively short period of time, while still having a certain gap to make up, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines to achieve "overtaking on the straightaway"?
In addition to having a firm belief in goals, paths, and abilities, universities should also fully leverage three advantages: first, the advantage of being a latecomer, by continuously introducing and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the advantage of culture, by inheriting the wisdom of the five-thousand-year Chinese civilization, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, and thereby consolidating power, creating brands, and enhancing image; and third, the advantage of institutions, by taking advantage of the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven development, mobilizing consensus and synergy, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a solid and sustainable foundation for universities to accelerate their surpassing of world-class standards.
It is particularly important to note that building world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach. Each school must play to its strengths while also showcasing its individuality and uniqueness.
The distinctive features of a school should include both common Chinese characteristics and its own unique goals, traditions of education, and resource endowment.
For Zhejiang University, we emphasize the following three aspects in our education: first, we highlight the distinctive features of talent cultivation for innovation and entrepreneurship, build an integrated educational environment that integrates science and education, industry and academia, and form a full chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, we highlight the distinctive features of disciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create a regulatory environment for disciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate emerging interdisciplinary disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; and third, we emphasize the distinctive features of the educational system and social service, conduct in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the Zhejiang University-wide production-education-research cooperation system.
During this process, it is particularly important to always uphold the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university resonates with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto "Seeking Truth and Innovation" and the shared values of "Studying Hard, Cultivating Morality, Discerning Right from Wrong, and Being Practical" together constitute the latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit, which also includes "embracing the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, nurturing the true essence of humanity, serving the people, and building the nation."
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural depth, and consolidate spiritual power. It has a rich content and profound meaning.
Among them, "Hanjiang River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, which manifests itself in the aspiration of "using the world's talents for the benefit of my country"; "Qiyuan Xuande" emphasizes the spirit of seeking the truth and striving for perfection, which means that the university should not only pursue the truth, but also receive the refinement and tempering of morality and character; "Kaiwu Qianmin" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of new knowledge, scientific innovation, and reform and development; and "Shumei Bangguo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that the university should always be in harmony with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the very soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"The wise can hear what is not said, and the enlightened can see what is not there."
Chinese higher education institutions should further anchor themselves in the overall context of socialism with Chinese characteristics and deeply understand the historical mission they shoulder and the position they occupy in the era, so as to accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanitarian care and independence, allows the university spirit to resonate with the spirit of the times, the national spirit, and the ethnic spirit, thereby providing endless power to achieve national prosperity and ethnic revival, and to realize the common ideals of humanity.

Guangxi University students can take a leave of absence to start a business for up to five years - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Nanning May 19 Special Wire (Reporter Zhang Yan): Recently, reporters learned from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department that in the future, universities in Guangxi will implement flexible academic schedules, extend the leave of absence period for university students, and lengthen the leave of absence period for students engaged in entrepreneurship from 2 to 5 years beyond the original academic schedule. The time spent on leave of absence for the purpose of entrepreneurship will be counted as a period of practical education.
To promote the enhancement of university students' entrepreneurial and innovative capabilities, the education, human resources, and other departments in Guangxi have joined forces to build an entrepreneurship platform. They have also built more university student off-campus practice teaching bases, university science parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases to provide external support for university students' entrepreneurial activities.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in universities should reach 3,000 square meters or more for undergraduate schools, and 2,000 square meters or more for vocational schools.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and prioritizes supporting students with outstanding performance in innovation and entrepreneurship to switch majors.
University teachers must spend at least two months on an industry internship every two years to improve their awareness and ability in innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Autonomous Region Education Department requires that all universities in Guangxi implement the university student innovation and entrepreneurship training program in depth, and strive to ensure that every university student participates in such a program during their time in school.
Universities should actively organize students to participate in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at all levels, and provide financial support.
NEWS GOV-MO: Australia awards honorary doctorates to seven distinguished individuals
Macau University held the "Ceremony for the Conferment of Honorary Degrees and Higher Degrees in 2021" today (November 11), conferring honorary doctoral degrees on Liu Zhengyi, Chen Kaiqian, Nakamura Shujiro, Li Lanjun, Li Xiaolian, Zhu Jiliang, and Jiang Chaohui in recognition of their outstanding achievements and significant contributions to the development of society and education.
During the conferment ceremony, the Chief Executive and Pro-Chancellor of Macao, Mr. Ho Iat-seng, in the company of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the University of Macau, Mr. Lin Kin-cheng, and the President of the University of Macau, Mr. Song Yong-hua, conferred the honorary doctorate degree.
Professor Liu Zhengyi was awarded an honorary doctorate in education, Professor Chen Kaiqian was awarded an honorary doctorate in philosophy, Professor Nakamura Shuji was awarded an honorary doctorate in philosophy, Professor Li Lanjun was awarded an honorary doctorate in philosophy, Professor Li Xiaolian was awarded an honorary doctorate in management, and Professor Zhu Julian was awarded an honorary doctorate in philosophy. Ms. Jiang Chaohui was awarded an honorary doctorate in philosophy.
In his speech, Ouyang Yu first extended warm congratulations and sincere respect to the seven distinguished individuals who were awarded honorary doctoral degrees, for their extraordinary achievements in different fields and their outstanding contributions to the development of the country and the progress of the world. He also extended his most sincere congratulations and blessings to the graduates and their parents, as well as his heartfelt respect to the university's faculty and staff who are dedicated to their work and have academic excellence.
Son Yifeng, a professor at the School of Humanities and Languages at the University of Adelaide, said that Professor Liu Zhengyi is a world-renowned economist known for his outstanding academic achievements and forward-looking educational philosophy.
In addition to his achievements in economic development, economic growth, and the East Asian economic sphere, he is also a visionary leader in education.
In short, he has made outstanding contributions in many fields.
Sun Yize said that Professor Nakamura Shuji is a pioneer in the field of sustainable energy technologies when he read a tribute to him.
He was one of the three Nobel Prize winners in Physics in 2014 for inventing the blue light-emitting diode (LED).
Professor Nakamura's invention not only completely changed the lighting industry, but also led to the widespread use of white light emitting diodes (LEDs) in everyday life and industrial production, making a huge contribution to the well-being of humanity.
Sun Yifei said when reading the tribute to Li Lanjun, "Professor Li Lanjun, as the pioneer of China's artificial liver industry, established a unique and effective Li system of artificial liver, which made significant breakthroughs in the treatment of severe hepatitis and liver failure, and significantly reduced the mortality rate of liver failure."
In the fight against COVID-19, her and her team's "four-resist two-balance" proposal, as well as the three major technologies of artificial liver, microbiome, and stem cells they brought with them, have significantly improved the survival rate of severe cases.
Sun Yifan said when reading the tribute to Li Xiaolian, "Professor Li Xiaolian laid the foundation for innovative research in operations management, shaped the way of thinking about supply chain theory and practice, and fundamentally changed business models around the world."
Li Xiaolian is famous for popularizing the concept of the long whip effect in operations management, and he explored ways to deal with this phenomenon.
Now, in the face of the pandemic and a tense economic situation, the long tail effect is becoming more and more apparent, leading to severe disruptions in the supply chain.
Li Xiaolian's forward-looking research is like a breath of fresh air, helping the industry overcome difficulties and bringing enormous social value.
Sun Yiyuan said when reading the tribute to Juliane that in her research work, she discovered a breakthrough and innovative dyeing technique for preparing samples, which enjoys a high reputation among domestic and foreign scientific peers.
She has been awarded many prestigious honors, including the title of International European-Asian Academy of Sciences Fellow, for her extraordinary scientific achievements, and has earned the respect and admiration she deserves in the world of science for her brilliant accomplishments.
Chen Xin, acting director of the Australia-China-Hong Kong Institute of Medical Pharmacy, said when reading Professor Chen Kaixian's tribute, "Professor Chen Kaixian has been engaged in drug development for more than 40 years. His outstanding scientific achievements and significant contributions to the country, Macau, Macau University, and the national key laboratory have earned him a high international status and reputation.
His positive role in promoting the development of traditional Chinese medicine in Macau and the Greater Bay Area fully reflects his sense of mission to contribute to the national medical and pharmaceutical development strategy.
During the reading of the tribute to Ms. Jiang Chaohui, the President of the University of Technology Sydney, Shun Cheng, said that Ms. Jiang's contributions to the development of major inventions and patents related to storage virtualization, navigation, file systems, and power management have been more than 15 in total, all of which are highly practical, widely used, and enhance the convenience of human life.
As a highly accomplished inventor, Ms. Jiang is often able to simplify complex scientific and theoretical concepts and make them accessible to the general public.
Finally, Chen Kai read the farewell speech as an honorary doctor on behalf of the delegation.
He was pleased to see that Macau and the Greater Bay Area have established a good example for the pharmaceutical industry: from the establishment of the first national key laboratory for Chinese medicine quality research at UM to the vigorous development of traditional Chinese medicine in the Greater Bay Area, UM has played a huge role in integrating the region's excellent talent in the field of traditional Chinese medicine.
In addition, he believes that the management team at UNSW has foresight and wisdom, not only providing students with a fertile ground for academic research, but also supplying the society with many talents with a sense of responsibility.
He is very honored to engage in exchanges and cooperation with ANU, and sincerely congratulates ANU on its recent achievements.

As NFTs quickly went viral, the cryptocurrency community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who had lost job opportunities due to the pandemic starting to earn a stable income from the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, which combines various gameplay elements including NFTs. It is currently the NFT project with the highest trading volume, with over $3 billion in transactions to date.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, approaching Honor of Kings.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity official announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of Axie Infinity has spread a new "play-to-earn" model to more people, thanks to the help of blockchain and smart contracts. Players are no longer limited to a single character; they can not only enjoy the game and earn economic benefits from it, but also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This autonomy is not granted by the game developers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
The biggest impression I got from seeing the news about my friend's stock price was the choice of the industry in which the company operates, i.e. the choice of the investment target industry. First, the company should choose an industry with a large growth potential, with a market size of at least 100 billion yuan; second, the company should choose an industry with good future growth potential, i.e. an industry that will reach its best growth potential in the next 3-5 years; and third, the company should choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and the flatness or ruggedness of the track refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Good luck on the right track!
The first thing to do in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The strategy is to "do the right things," that is, to do things the right way.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," that is, to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, while tactics are about implementation. In most cases, there is room for strategic thinking above tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) can be considered from the perspective of whether to continue to deepen in the current field or expand horizontally into other fields (strategic thinking); how to increase customer retention (tactical thinking) can be considered from the perspective of how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); how to increase activity participation (tactical thinking) can be considered from the perspective of setting the right activity KPIs, achieving the correct activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and precisely acquiring new customers; how to increase DAU (tactical thinking) can be considered from the perspective of whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin saw several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador designated Bitcoin as legal tender, marking the first time Bitcoin has become the legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares' Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the launch of the first legally compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. capital market, expanding the scope of cryptocurrency investment once again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data load in transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

Asian American groups complain of discrimination in the admissions process at Yale and other Ivy League schools - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian American groups submitted complaints to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting against the discrimination of Asian American applicants by three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - during the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington that day.
The group's chairman Zhao Yukuang said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission requirements of American elite universities had grown exponentially, but the proportion of Asians at the three American elite universities remained roughly the same.
Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the so-called "holistic consideration" admissions process, "systematically and persistently over a long period of time."
Zhao Yukuan said that according to research conducted by Sanders and other scholars in 2014, among the three universities, Asian applicants had the lowest acceptance rate relative to the number of applicants from all ethnic groups.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, and that Yale University and Brown University have effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukuan told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will launch an investigation after filing a complaint, and then take measures to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asians during the admissions process once the facts are established.
They also hope that the complained-against universities will proactively address the issue and change their admission policies towards Asians.
At present, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, and at that time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions practices, but the U.S. Department of Education declined to act on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese American groups that participated in the appeal, other groups that participated include Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Yushiting Town, Yueqing, Zhejiang Province, from a real estate agency. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of purchasing the factory building with the owner's relative Lin X, and on the same day, transferred 200,000 yuan to the bank as a deposit.
Lin signed the "Deposit Receipt for Factory Purchase and Sale" as the recipient of the deposit, indicating therein that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller, and the parties have agreed to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within one week."
However, afterward, the parties failed to reach a consensus on major contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale, the payment method, etc., which led to the delay in signing the house purchase contract.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the contract content, a few days later, Lin Xi returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After a long search, Mr. Lu finally found a house he liked, paid the deposit, and prepared the down payment. All that was left was to sign the contract, but the seller suddenly changed his mind and refused to sell, leaving Mr. Lu feeling helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Lin at the Yueyang Municipal People's Court.
After deliberation, the court found that the parties failed to sign a formal contract in the end, and that the blame should not be attributed solely to the defendant. Therefore, the case should not be subject to the penalty of forfeiting the deposit, and the defendant should not be held liable for returning the deposit in double the amount.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer's advice] It is necessary to exercise due caution in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary due diligence obligations, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied, and other related information, and specifying the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese Website) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke on Saturday (December 11) and said that the United States held the "Leaders' Summit for Democracy," which was "drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and instrumentalizing democracy, using the pretext of democracy to engage in anti-democratic activities, inciting division and confrontation, and diverting attention from domestic problems."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value concepts on others, carried out a 'democratic transformation,' arbitrarily imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions,' causing disastrous consequences."
"Democracy" has already become the "weapon of mass destruction" the United States uses to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day conference was held via video, with leaders from 111 countries around the world invited to attend, including Taiwanese leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
Before the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for criticizing the United States' own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
Internationally and domestically in the United States, there have also been voices of criticism, such as criticizing the invitation of some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, and questioning whether the Biden administration's true intention was to promote democracy or to pursue geopolitical goals by organizing this summit.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the video democracy summit.
In a statement on Saturday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "The pathological nature of American democracy is fully revealed today, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, party polarization, political radicalization, social polarization, racial conflict, and income inequality becoming more and more severe," and that "American democracy is based on a capitalist foundation and is a 'game for the rich'."
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, and achieve transparent accountability, which will make us better able to resist the buffering and shockwaves of authoritarianism, as well as those who openly seek power at the expense of the public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not a given, "We must constantly renew it in every generation, in my view, this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that "global democracy and human rights face a persistent and worrying challenge at this time, and democracy needs defenders."
The United States has pledged to launch a one-year action plan after the Democracy Summit, including a proposal worth $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical Democracy Summit to be held at the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all implement our commitments and report on our progress next year for all countries."
Yes, I'm afraid he might have sent it to the wrong address

It's been a long time since I've been to Daychang. The fruit juice is still as delicious as ever, and the ingredients are authentic and plentiful. I ordered the stir-fried dumplings for the first time, and they have the Southern flavor of soft, fluffy dough that I love!
The rice is cooked just right, the portion is very generous, and the signature silk paper chicken wings are as delicious as ever. The soup is also good, and the mustard greens are also...
Good taste, friendly service, and good meat

It always takes a long time to get a bowl of congee at the door, and the congee pots are all cracked...
I haven't been to Day Chang for several years now, and the rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the flow of customers.

What is the way to drink Red Card whiskey?
Everyone has different interests, some like collecting, some like food, and of course, some like drinking wine. Red Card Whisky is one of the most popular Scotch whiskies in the world, and it has won a gold medal at the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has its own unique flavor, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, you are wasting its mellow aroma.
So how do you drink red whiskey?
Here is a brief introduction from the editor.
How to drink Red Whiskey:
The Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is a blend of about 35 Scottish whiskies, with a rich aroma and traditional Scottish whisky characteristics. The rich aroma has a sweet and smoky flavor.
The entry is rich and refreshing, with a hint of spices and a strong smoky malt flavor.
The wine can be served directly with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Redbreast whiskey has entered the Chinese market, and to suit the taste of the Chinese people, Redbreast whiskey + cola or Sprite or 7UP bubbly drinks have become a long-lasting fashion trend.
These sweet drinks not only neutralize the acidity, but also bring visual pleasure, and when added to drinks, they have the effect of diluting the alcohol flavor and changing the taste.
Red whisky with slices of lemon and sugar cubes (sugar can also be used) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
The authentic red wine has a slightly sour taste. Adding sugar can neutralize the acidity, while lemon will add a refreshing aroma to the wine, of course, the sweet-sour ratio can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The three ways listed above are the best ways to drink red whiskey. You can try them out as a reference and hope that my introduction can help you.
Education Thinking: How University Exams Make "Nerds" and "Slackers" Happy - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou University of Transport wrote letters to the school leaders to express their confusion about the university exams and proposed increasing the difficulty of the exams, changing the exam formats, and making the exams truly reflect the students' actual abilities.
Indeed, university exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In the university campus, students come from all corners of the world, and their abilities and knowledge levels vary greatly. As a result, their learning conditions are very different.
Assessing a group with such diverse characteristics is bound to evoke different feelings.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type and have a high degree of repetition, and if the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who don't study hard may be able to pass the exam by cramming just before the exam, but if they try other methods, they may achieve a result that is twice as good.
As a result, there is the "lazy student" who can pass with flying colors without putting in much effort, and there is the "academic superstar" who never misses a class, who always does their homework and takes good notes, and who doesn't score much higher than others in exams.
In this way, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not exaggerating the problems that exist in university exams. I believe that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this perspective, we should give a thumbs-up to the three students who wrote the letters.
In fact, people who have gone to university know that it is not uncommon for students to engage in last-minute cramming, try all sorts of ways to "steal" test questions from their teachers, and try to narrow the scope of the test in order to get "special tutoring" before the exam, and even to bring cheat sheets into the exam or ask their teachers to give them special treatment after the exam.
In my view, the key to assessing the quality of a university's examinations lies in the teacher's comprehensive understanding of both teaching and learning, and the scientific design of the examinations based on this understanding.
Once you enter the undergraduate stage of university, the major begins to specialize, and many of the major courses focus on basic knowledge.
It is undeniable that whether one has a thorough grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is a matter to be tested in university exams.
In contrast, undergraduate knowledge is mostly based on the fundamental theories and basic knowledge of a discipline, and from a knowledge point of view, the scope of change is not very large and is basically fixed.
As the teacher said, "Twenty years ago, we learned the basic knowledge of mathematics at university, and we are still learning it now, and it is still important."
However, the knowledge points remain basically the same, which does not mean that the test format is simple or that the test questions are repetitive.
In many universities, the examinations are usually formed by a group of examiners, and then compiled by senior teachers with expertise in the subject, and the examinations are also graded by all the teachers in charge of the subject, which can to some extent overcome the problem of repeated test questions.
However, it is necessary to design a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning, and the difficulty of the questions should follow a normal distribution based on the overall learning situation of the students. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively understand the teaching and learning situation, and comprehensively analyze the students' learning level, so as to have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and types of questions, so as to highlight the assessment of basic knowledge while also incorporating the assessment of abilities, and at the same time innovatively design the types of questions.
Examinations are the conductor's baton for university education. What kind of examinations there are, that is what students will prepare for. Over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The Lanzhou University of Technology takes the suggestions from students very seriously and has already deployed a plan for improvement across the entire school.
It requires that each teaching unit organizes teachers to conduct research and self-evaluation of course end-of-term examinations, as well as the drafting of examination papers and related regulations, and at the same time strengthens supervision and inspection of the examination paper drafting and review process, refines the assessment criteria, and strengthens the comprehensive evaluation of all aspects of the teaching process.
From a mechanistic perspective, solving problems such as the lack of diversity in test questions and the repetition of questions is an issue that universities need to address. Of course, appropriate regulations need to be put in place, but the key lies in daily practice. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only mastering the content of the course, but also grasping the learning situation of students, so that teaching and learning can be better connected and form a positive feedback loop. This will make the examinations more in line with reality, and will also allow "nerds" and "losers" to each find their place.

Madame Gin Wedding Photography (Nanjie Store) does not have any branches yet.
Before taking the photo, we changed the time twice because it wasn't scheduled properly. Consultant Lanlan was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
Later, we chose a nice weekend to shoot it.
The staff at Mrs. Kim's are amazing, whether they are consultants, makeup artists, or photographers.
That was the first time in my life that I officially did my makeup. Wow! I can't believe it, one day I will also look that good, haha.
Xiao Jie and the other sister (sorry, I can't remember her name) were super patient with the makeup and the makeup looked very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in Jiawan City, and fortunately, the weather was very good that day, and we didn't feel too cold. The makeup artist kept an eye on our clothes, accessories, and hair from time to time while we were filming, and if anything wasn't quite right, she would immediately help us fix it.
The photographer was also very funny, and we all felt very happy after a day of taking photos.
When choosing the photos, because we saw so many cases online, we didn't want to let the customer delete too many photos, but when we were choosing the photos, really, we didn't have any intention of adding more photos, we just took the 24 photos included in the package (I heard that my cousin's sister-in-law, who took her wedding dress photos at about the same time, added more than 10,000 photos to her 7,000+ package, and I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today, the photos were fixed, and Lalan sent them to me. I looked at two of them and thought they weren't quite right, so they immediately fixed them for me again.
I compared the photos my sister took before with ours, and I think our photos are really great, simple and fresh, just the style I was looking for.
I sincerely recommend that everyone go to Xuanhan Jinfu Lady to take wedding photos!
Set price: 3999 yuan

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah were born without birth certificates due to shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu, October 11) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the depletion of stocks of special anti-counterfeiting paper, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since early October, affecting a total of 3,200 people to date.
However, the head of the agency, Karua Aminu, assured that all babies who have already applied for birth certificates will have their information recorded in the system, and duplicate certificates will be issued once the security paper arrives next week.
He explained the issue of newsprint shortage in Sabah that lasted for 10 months in response to a report by an online media at a press conference.
He said that the problem had appeared two months ago, and Sarawak also faced the same issue.
One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in delivery to our country.
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah newspapers is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot be pledged as collateral for inventory in other states.
Keru Aminuis revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6 and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The agency will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and then proceed to the final stage of printing in Sabah immediately afterwards. It is estimated that the goods will be delivered to applicants within two additional working days (December 20).
"We will notify applicants to go to the local branches to pick up the admission forms."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 application forms for enrollment so far this year.
I waited for more than 7 o'clock until now
Isn't that almost here?
I mean food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG
Good, thank you, because the restaurant said it was ready

It is super convenient, just like opening a computer, and it has solved my problem of insufficient hard disk space on my computer.
The brand new solid-state mobile hard drive that just arrived today cannot be read by the mobile solid-state hard drive computer, but it can be read by the computer using a USB drive. The mobile solid-state hard drive computer does not recognize it.
The machine is very easy to operate, and it looks elegant and beautiful.
I used it for an afternoon today, and the cooling is very good. It barely feels hot, and the running speed is very fast. It starts up instantly and kills 99% of users.
The battery is also very powerful, with standby time of 9 hours and use time of 4 hours, which should not be a problem. In short, I feel very happy to be able to buy a device of this quality at this price. Other features will be added later.
It looks very good.
Performance-wise, it will take some time to evaluate it.
The machine is fast, bigger than expected, and the rendering effects are great. I like it. I'll review it after using it for a while.
Not bad, not bad. The serial number of the machine can be checked in Hong Kong, and the quality should be OK.
** It doesn't feel big, it feels heavy. It's actually not that big to hold with one hand, but it's a little bit bigger than the 15.6-inch ones, and it's very stable when running. I don't feel any lag, and I love the sound of the fan cooling it down. It feels really good, and it doesn't spin like a gaming laptop.
It's not bad, much cheaper than the official flagship store, and they even gave me a backpack. I think it's pretty good.
The shop's service was also good. They reminded me to update the BIOS and promptly issued the **.
Worth it!
Heat dissipation: Heat dissipation is very good, with almost no heat  Lightweight: Easy to carry  Appearance material: Traditional Thinkpad design, satisfactory
The reputable seller carefully inspected the entire machine's appearance, all interfaces, and there were no signs of refurbishment or previous use. Indeed, it was a brand new US version machine with the same configuration as shown on the page.
I forgot to bring my backpack, and they immediately provided me with one, although it was not the original manufacturer's backpack. However, their after-sales service is enough to prove that they are a conscientious seller.
If a friend needs to buy a laptop, buy it back.
Appearance material: The appearance is elegant; Display effect: The screen resolution is acceptable, clear, and thin; Lightness degree: It has a certain sense of quality, after all, heavier things feel better.
Cooling effect: I tried it out a bit at first, and will give a more detailed evaluation later.
The keyboard typing is quite good, and they also sent a mouse and a converter. Compared to the domestic version, this configuration is quite affordable. Overall, it's a good value for the money, and the machine's performance can be evaluated after using it for a while.
This screen is really comfortable!
It is very smooth to use, and I will give a review after using it for a while!
Education News: Beijing Compresses the Proportion of Special Students for Middle School Admission in 2016 - Xinhua News Agency
On the 21st and 22nd, the enrollment examination for gifted students applying to middle schools in Beijing was organized and implemented by the education bureaus of each district.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the proportion of specialty students admitted, making the competition among specialty students even more intense.
As an example, in Dongcheng District, the proportion of students with special talents entering middle school from primary school this year is generally less than 5% of the district's total enrollment quota. The planned enrollment number is 380, and the proportion of students who actually enroll is less than 10% of the school's enrollment quota.
All students who have sports, art, and technology specialties and have registered online are eligible to participate in the specialty student recruitment examination.
To facilitate students to participate in the inspection near their homes, Dongcheng District continues the inspection arrangement from last year, setting 1–2 inspection sites in each school district, a total of 13 inspection sites.
Each examination site is divided into examination rooms according to the examination districts. The time slots are divided by hours, and students will enter the examination site at the designated time to take the exam in different examination districts and rooms.
On May 23, the Education and Enrollment Center of the District published online the list of students who passed the examination and inspection, and students can check the examination results online.
Can it be delivered in 10 to 15 minutes?
No food received
The key thing is that I didn't eat dinner tonight
If it can't be delivered, we should say so earlier.

During the meeting, Kvesic positively evaluated the relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and China and stated that he had visited China during the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008 and was deeply impressed by China's excellent organizational work. He firmly believed that China had the capability to host a successful Winter Olympics in special times; Bosnia and Herzegovina was very much looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics, and the Bosnian Olympic Committee was actively organizing the participation; Bosnia hoped to use this as an opportunity to expand its exchanges and cooperation with China in the field of sports.

The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open, presenting a simple, safe, and exciting spectacle to the world.
We look forward to deepening exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the areas of winter sports event preparation, athlete training, etc., and the Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridge role, using the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote the continuous deepening of cultural exchanges between the two countries, and to wish Bosnia and Herzegovina athletes success in the Beijing Games.
Prior to the meeting, the Bosnian Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete of the Year" award ceremony, at which Qi Ping, as a special guest, presented awards to Bosnia's best young athletes.
Promotional videos for the Beijing Winter Olympics were played on a loop at the event.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism for Epidemic Diseases Requires Strengthening Epidemic Control in Port Cities Within 48 Hours of Negative Nucleic Acid Test Results and Setting Up "Buffer Zones" - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work in port cities, requiring that people leaving land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) within the past 48 hours must hold a negative nucleic acid test result, and that people arriving in land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after their arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date when the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities determine the scope of port cities and announce it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that conditional ports cities may consider setting up buffer zones for epidemic control within their jurisdictions.
According to a relevant official from the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health and Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar and there are frequent exchanges between the two border populations.
Implementing a differentiated management policy based on regional divisions, the single line of defense against the spread of the virus has become two lines, and it is hoped that the epidemic control can be advanced to the frontline, thereby reducing the risk of the spread of the epidemic and achieving the greatest epidemic control effect with the least social impact and lowest social cost.
In recent weeks, China has experienced several local clustered outbreaks, all of which were imported from overseas through ports of entry.
The above notice pointed out that these problems expose the fact that some localities' epidemic monitoring and early warning are not timely, the closed-loop management of high-risk personnel is not implemented properly, nucleic acid testing is merely a formality, the disinfection of cold chain goods at all stages is not comprehensive, the management of centralized quarantine facilities is not standardized, and epidemic emergency response is not scientific and precise enough.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanisms in port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to accelerate the shortcomings and weaknesses in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to carry out epidemic prevention and control work with no letup, in a scientific and precise manner, to strengthen the external defense line against imported epidemics.
The notice emphasizes that each port city should synchronize epidemic prevention and civilian livelihood protection work, synchronize research and deployment, publicize and ensure the smooth operation of the civilian livelihood protection hotline, and regularly check for potential risks in the supply of basic living necessities, prices, etc., and promptly address and proactively respond to prominent issues raised by the public.
According to the notice, the designated port cities include open land, water, and air ports located in the counties (cities, districts, banners) where they are located, as well as the cities (prefectures, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government) where they are located. The specific scope will be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) according to epidemic prevention and control needs.

This item is vintage, and first-time buyers of vintage items should search for the "vintage" or "vintage clothing" entries on Baidu.
A rarity.
Vintage items are bound to have minor imperfections, so if you decide to purchase vintage-style products, you should be mentally prepared for this. If you are a perfectionist, please think twice before buying, and if the imperfections are more obvious, I will explain them. This is a characteristic of vintage products, and in my opinion, good things are not affected by such minor imperfections!
The store does not accept returns or exchanges for vintage products.
The term "vintage clothing" refers to clothing that has an old-fashioned, retro feel, which is also known as nostalgia. People like vintage clothing because of its timelessness and quality.
So, if a girl can't handle it, don't say her clothes are old-fashioned, just say she's not suitable!
There is not even a little bit of anti-risk capability in cautious shopping. Online shopping is risky, and shopping in general requires caution.
If an item is not suitable or liked by the buyer for reasons such as their own, the seller can list it for sale on their behalf. Once sold, it cannot be returned or exchanged, so please do not bid if you are unable to do so. Thank you for your cooperation!
On June 11, 2021, some were sold in the circle.
Order by number only, no returns or exchanges for antique items.

YouTube reveals the truth about the US military's 20-year bloodthirsty killing spree - Xinhua News Agency
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a short documentary film titled "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States launched the Afghan War under the pretext of counterterrorism, forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war, and committing various crimes against humanity over the course of 20 years of poverty, bloodthirstiness, and indiscriminate killing.
Abusing drones to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian facilities, they perverted human nature and formed murder squads.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black jails" to subject "suspects" to various tortures and personal humiliations.
One atrocity after another has aroused more and more Afghans' hatred.
As the video says, the US "war on terror" is "getting more and more terrifying."
The war has not brought the Afghan people peace, democracy, and prosperity, but only a country in ruins and countless deaths and destructions.
Click the video to expose the truth that the United States uses the pretext of "anti-terrorism" to engage in bloodthirsty slaughter, and to expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I accidentally came across the following article, which discusses from a business perspective and from the perspective of shelf life why the customer wants the logistics company in the bonded zone to help with canning, even though canning is a form of deep processing that is not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's operations. Perhaps the following text can explain why the customer wants to do this.
I visited many milk powder factories and encountered many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the powdered milk in bags and the powdered milk in cans have exactly the same raw materials, with no differences whatsoever.
So people will naturally ask: Why is the shelf life of bagged products one year, while that of canned products is two years or longer?
Or you might ask: Why is the price difference between bottled and bagged products so large?
In fact, many consumers, or "mommy types," believe that the quality will be much better because the materials are different. They start from this point of view.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but people think that the expensive ones are the best.
Some consumers have also eaten it with this attitude and then said that the taste or flavor was different from what they expected!
Now I'll tell you all the reasons why it's expensive. Where is it expensive?
Why is there such a large price difference between them, given that their raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers consider the price when packaging their products, if the price is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, which means that the manufacturers' profits will be very low, or even nonexistent, so how can the manufacturers survive?
Therefore, they have a very large upward pricing range to ensure their profit margins on the pretense that they are listening.
Therefore, most manufacturers promote ear-packed products rather than bag-packed ones.
There are also so many companies that spend millions or even billions of dollars each year on advertising, so where does that money come from?
You can imagine.
As society develops, the promotion costs of the market, such as the costs of promotional staff in shopping malls, display costs in shopping malls, product giveaway costs, and advertising costs, are constantly increasing.
So, each manufacturer is constantly adding new products, and they are all custom-made, and their prices are constantly rising. In fact, these are new products that have emerged as a result of the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, but in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not increase by more than 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There is also a part of the brands that, in order to promote their products, will resort to any means to hook up with hospital doctors, who will then assist in promoting the products, with profits ranging from RMB30 to RMB80 per sale.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such operating methods. In fact, this practice is actually harmful to consumers.
It is recommended that people buy bagged milk powder and put it in a container at home under the condition that there is a container available. This will save costs and increase the storage and sealing properties of the milk powder, with no negative impact on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of canned goods is longer than that of bagged goods. After opening the bag, the shelf life of canned goods and bagged goods is the same. The only difference is that bagged goods are difficult to store after opening, and are prone to spoilage.
The food was delivered late, and by then it was cold and hard. It was completely impossible to eat it.
And the sauce also spilled out.
Immediately cancel, the things he sent us from #PRS_ORG# are definitely cold now
I've never won one!
#NAME# said you didn't have anyone to go get

However, we should also remind restaurants and riders:
Avoid it happening again next time
I want to know the exact delivery time
That time was constantly delayed
I don't know how long I have to wait
If the order is canceled, can the money be refunded?
How do you pay the service fee to the driver?
More than an hour ago, it was confirmed that there was one rider
I don't want to wait any longer
Don't scare people off the starting line - Xinhua News Agency
When browsing the book market, one can often feel the popularity of success-related books.
Many of today's successful self-help books promote the "best principle"—that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it," then telling you what you need to do.
In other words, it skipped over the most important and fundamental step, which is "how to do it."
It is for this reason that these books all share a common characteristic: either they go all out to do their best, or they might as well not do anything at all; either they are 100, or they are 0; either they climb Mount Tai, or they might as well just stay where they are.
This "best principle" makes everyone agree that it is "absolutely correct," but 99% of people will be scared off at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "making a 180-degree turn and starting over as a new person," which is exactly what many people struggle with.
For those who are rigid, conservative, and resistant to change, you are especially prone to shouting "You need to change!" right in their ears, which is nothing but self-deception and beating a dead horse.
Most people will feel hesitant and reluctant in front of the two words "change," and will be unable to make up their minds; or they will make a hasty decision to "change" based on a momentary impulse, and then bravely take the first step, but this is often short-lived, and they soon give up and fail to persevere.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "From Tomorrow On" skit is the most vivid expression of this "universal human nature" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the bar is set too high, and it often exceeds the limits of what ordinary people can achieve, leaving the vast majority of people feeling frustrated.
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a path that could enable more ordinary people to achieve relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the bar" — it encourages a "accumulating small wins to achieve big wins" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, doing 1 is fine, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand dune in front of your house is fine, because it's still better than standing still.
In short, doing something is always better than doing nothing.
Because the barriers have been significantly lowered, there is now a greater possibility that ordinary people will be able to persevere, and the chances of success will also increase if they do.
Following the path to success based on the "second-best principle" does require a slightly longer journey.
In short, the "best principle" may appear to be about making everyone successful on the surface, but in reality, it can only effectively motivate a minority; while the "second-best principle" can motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.

The naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) According to information from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the latest monitoring results show that the bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year compared to last year, reaching 10.85 thousand tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
The bare carp of Qinghai Lake is also known as the Wen River fish. It is a unique and precious fish species found only in Qinghai Lake, and plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s of the 20th century, the Qinghai Lake naked carp population was drastically reduced due to massive human-caused killings and the deterioration of the naked carp breeding habitat. In 2002, the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake amounted to only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Chinese Red List of Endangered Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the practice of stocking lakes for fish farming, prohibiting any units, groups, and individuals from catching naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main tributaries and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
Meanwhile, the protection efforts are being continuously strengthened through measures such as artificial stocking and release, as well as the cleaning of the main inflow rivers into Qinghai Lake and the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passages," while the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, the deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that as of now, the total number of artificially bred and released naked carp in Qinghai Lake has exceeded 180 million, accounting for more than 23% of the contribution to the recovery of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan region is an important ecological barrier and water source replenishment area for China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone that controls the desertification of the western regions from spreading to the east.
To protect the ecological environment and water resources of the Three Rivers Source area and the Qinghai Lake watershed, and to protect aquatic wildlife, Qinghai has successively issued notices banning fishing in the key watersheds of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since the beginning of this year, establishing a comprehensive ban on fishing system for the "One River, One River, One Lake".
I used the #PRS_ORG# RED credit card to pay for food over $180.

I wonder if it was misplaced or if someone took it, thanks
It's already been 1 hour, and it still hasn't been delivered
I just read an article about fake examples that was too long.
Let me educate the men who are unaware.
Most girls will experience their first menstrual period suddenly at some point between the ages of 13 and 15, and will reach menopause around the age of 50.
Under the condition that the body is healthy, visits will be more regular every month.
However, it is not regular enough to allow for accurate predictions. There is usually a margin of error of about a week or so, so you need to prepare in advance. Sometimes, if you are unlucky, it can suddenly come early by several days.
The length of time, amount of blood loss, and severity of menstrual cramps vary from person to person. For some, it lasts three days; for others, it lasts a week. For some, the bleeding is light; for others, it is heavy. For some, there is no reaction; for others, it is so painful that an ambulance has to take them away. Menstrual cramps change over time, and just because it didn't hurt before doesn't mean it won't hurt in the future.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and bleeding can last for several days from the start to the end. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or sanitary tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from flowing onto clothes or chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused by the release of prostaglandins. During the first few days of menstruation, taking ibuprofen can effectively relieve the monthly pain, but it is of little use after the pain starts.
Before menstruation, bloating of the uterus and excessive release of prolactin can cause stomach cramps.
If you suddenly get diarrhea for no apparent reason, your period will usually come within two days or so.
Sanitary napkins should be changed every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria will easily grow. Apart from sleeping time, the worst-case scenario is to change them six times a day, once a day for seven days a month, which amounts to 42 pieces. If you include the ones you prepare in advance, it could be as many as 50 pieces, and you don't have to use one every month.
(Here, change it a bit. You don't need to change the sanitary pads very often. You can change them every five or six hours, and at most every eight hours.)
During menstruation, hormones may make you more irritable, and ovulation can be unstable due to hormonal changes, which is very unfortunate, as your body is tripping you up.
However, official crime statistics show that women's ability to control their emotions is still quite high, and they are not likely to use emotional issues as an excuse.
It was not just blood, but also the detached endometrium.
After menstruation ends, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then gradually becomes thicker, which can be understood as the uterus being a house that is built every month (the endometrium becomes thicker) to prepare to welcome guests. If the guests do not come, the house is torn down (menstruation is expelled) and a new house is built the next month, over and over again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, I have had to bleed for several days every month for 24 hours at a time, and I also suffer from abdominal and back pain. Who would want that?
However, we are born because our mother has had her period, which is to prepare a house for you to live in for 10 months when you first enter this world. We should thank our mothers for having regular and healthy periods.
In the past, many things that women did were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into thinking that they were dirty and shameful. People thought that was just the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the preparations the female body makes to nurture life are disgusting, they shouldn't say it out loud in front of a large crowd. Girls, stand up and don't think that way anymore. You've never experienced it, and you won't experience it in this lifetime. Men who don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and insensitive. How can you face your mother with such an attitude? How can you want your own children?
Finally, sisters, try the cotton swabs, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and sending the wrong gift is more disappointing
You need to order a separate meal for the kids
I hope that the shop will check the quality of the goods even when they are busy.
Is the foot bath vibrating because of a short circuit?
Choosing the right foot bath tub can have a very good therapeutic effect on foot care. Today, the editor of Gome will answer this question and hope that it will be helpful to friends.
As people's awareness of healthcare increases, foot baths are becoming more and more popular among consumers, and a wide variety of products with different grades have emerged on the market, ranging from those priced at over a hundred yuan to those priced at over a thousand yuan. This gives consumers a great deal of choice.
On the surface of relevant data, sales of healthcare appliances such as foot bath tubs are booming compared to traditional household appliances, but foot bath tubs do not have specific industry standards, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electric water, isn't it?"
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt a tingling sensation in his feet while soaking them.
Mr. Li initially thought that the vibration function of the foot bath tub was the cause, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried his electric pencil, and it lit up! Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the footbath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchants, and the merchants' attitude was still good, although he had to return the foot bath. Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable despite this.
He discovered that the popular footbath, which has been around for a long time, does not have a clear and detailed industry standard for the setting of the highest temperature, its applicability to different groups of people, or the materials used to ensure safety.
However, in general, electricity problems in footbaths are rare, but it cannot be ruled out that a small number of products were not properly inspected before leaving the factory.
Therefore, when buying, choose a detachable foot bath.
The water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety hazards.
You can also just grab a pen and test it at random.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Perspective Headlines - Hunan Daily Online - Huashang Online
Xinhuanet, December 10 (Reporters: Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, Correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, Photographer: Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and the New Tea Promotion Conference were held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The event showcased the tea industry, innovated tea technology, promoted tea culture, and accelerated the pursuit of the goal of a tea industry worth 100 billion yuan.
Hou Shunli, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China National Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation, and Ye Hong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced the source of the Honghu Lake at the opening ceremony: the rise of red tea has injected new vitality into the "colorful Xiang tea" in Xinchang.
In recent years, the provincial Party Committee and provincial government have actively supported the development of the tea industry, and promoted the construction of the CNY100 billion Xiangxi Tea Industry, forming a development pattern of "Three Xiangs and Five Colorful Teas".
The tea industry in the province has stepped up innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main tea varieties taking turns to launch new products, while the main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea and tourism, boosting the incomes of tea farmers.
The winds of fortune shift, and red tea is back in the game.
According to experts in the tea industry in the province, after picking green tea, one can pick red tea and black tea, and tea farmers can have income all year round. Tea garden output is on the rise in a straight line.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders presented certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinyang was awarded the title of "Origin of Hunan Red Tea".
At the Xinyang Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants immediately placed an order for a high-mountain tea called "Ice Spring".
Wang Jun, the secretary general of the Anhui Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea leaf market to some extent, but there are many highlights to be seen at the Tea Expo.
Xinchang red tea is a splash of red, infused with the essence of tea culture, and is popular and in high demand, ushering in a new spring for the Xinchang tea industry.

Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through sensory perception by means of rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese name "metaphysics" comes from the phrase "form above is called dao, and form below is called qi" in the Book of Changes, "Systematic Arrangement Above", which was translated into Japanese by Tetsujirō Inoue (Meiji period) from the word metaphysic.
The metaphysical branch includes ontology, natural theology, and its related issues.
Ontology is "the study of what terms represent real entities in the world, and what terms only represent concepts."
Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concepts of natural causes, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolutionary theory.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, is a research method that does not mention God.
Phenomenology is a branch of philosophy that studies consciousness and its relationship with the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought in discussing "the relationship between the soul and the body."
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the essence, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically considers and studies human moral life; here, morality is defined as all behavioral norms accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstractly studying the nature of moral theory or criticism), and normative ethics (judging various different moral views and providing moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what ethical norms people should follow, applies ethics (the academic study of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including biomedical ethics, political ethics, etc.), and describes ethics (collecting information about how people live, summarizing it from observed patterns).
It is not based on the expected theory, but rather investigates the actual moral choices made by moral agents (moral agents are those who make moral decisions) and observed in real life, as well as all the moral factors that led to those choices, and discusses the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Varro and Montaigne, among others.
The second part: the ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, Represented by Machiavelli and Others, Modern Ethics (17th-18th centuries, British empiricist ethics, represented by Hume and others, Continental rationalist ethics, represented by Spinoza and others, 18th-century French Enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire and others, 18th-19th centuries, German Neo-Kantian ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel, 18th-19th centuries, British utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and Westcott, 19th century, evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley, late 19th century, Neo-Kantian ethics, represented by Liekard, 19th century, New Hegelian ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, late 19th century, non-rationalist ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche).
Logic is a discipline that studies "the principles and standards of effective reasoning and proof."
Logic usually consists of three parts: deduction, induction, and abduction, and can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the essence and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I sincerely thank all my friends for the humanitarian assistance they have provided to us over the past 30-plus years since the death of our loved ones. In particular, I would like to thank them for the assistance they have provided since I issued a humanitarian appeal to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has continued uninterrupted to this day.
Most of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and become independent.
It was your kind deeds that helped us, the families in distress, get through the most difficult times.
At present, the COVID-19 pandemic is raging across the globe, and most of the donors are already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you stop giving us, the bereaved, humanitarian donations for the Tiananmen Mothers group. This humanitarian aid activity should have long since ended with a perfect full stop.
I will always remember your kindness, and I am confident that your deeds will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way. Please forgive me for this!
Please accept my sincere congratulations.
Tao said: Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance provided by the American Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of carrying out humanitarian aid, the All-America Chinese Association and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation are parallel organizations, and project executives often overlap.

Aid money often fails to reach the hands of the Tiananmen victims' families.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Ding Teacher, a special group was established by the Tiananmen Mothers to coordinate and oversee the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "Tiananmen Orphan Education Fund", which was implemented for 11 years until 2009, when all the Tiananmen orphans had graduated from university. MCDF then established the "Tiananmen Orphan Poverty Relief Fund for the Elderly" and has been implementing it ever since.
The funding for these projects mainly comes from campus and social donations made in the year of the Tiananmen crackdown, as well as generous contributions from individuals, and is supported by the Democratic Foundation of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Re-education Research Foundation.
It wasn't until last year that the Tiananmen victims' families finally received a portion of the donations that had been collected in Hong Kong under the name of the Tiananmen incident 31 years earlier.
During this period, China Human Rights also independently implemented its humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the Tiananmen Square donation drive for the consideration of donors. We are indeed all retired elderly people, and our incomes are not as abundant as they were before retirement. We would like to thank Mr. Ding for his "Letter to a Friend" in this regard.
We will respect the families' decision to terminate this project within two years and resume it as needed.
We also express our thanks and respect to those brave and generous compatriots who have consistently risked their safety to deliver humanitarian aid over the years.

We are very grateful that you have chosen our products. Please take 5 minutes to read the following content carefully before using our chips:
After opening the box, please check whether the goods are complete.
If any are missing, please contact customer service as soon as possible.
The cover plate of the microfluidic chip is made of PC material. Do not introduce solvents that react chemically with PC.
Do not use a syringe pump directly to sample the chip, otherwise there is a risk of leakage.

Thank you, Bunny, for your review. Originally, you said that you didn't like the ancient style and that it wasn't suitable for the ancient style. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you, Dandan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction will give us the energy to continue moving forward, and we will keep going!
This photography studio is really great! I strongly recommend that all my friends come here!
From the reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, and photography to the post-production, there is nothing to complain about.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous and will create a makeup look that suits your style, using top-of-the-line brands.
Mr. Tian Liang is even more professional when it comes to photography.
The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little kittens to play with as well.
We work in Beijing, and the best photo studios in Beijing require you to queue up half a year in advance. My colleagues have had their photos taken in Beijing, and I took a look at them and thought they were just so-so.
I specifically sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We have poor control over our facial expressions, and I think this is also the case for most people. Liang Ge, the photographer, will capture these natural and exciting moments.
Makeup artists, photographers, post-production designers, a top-notch team.
When it comes out in large pieces, we and the people around us can't stop praising it.
I have already recommended my best friend, and she was just as delighted when she saw the photos.
I hope that such studios are not buried and that more people discover them, so that they can create their own unique style rather than the same old, same old.
We are very grateful for the five-star reviews from Jianying and Jingling, both of whom are very creative and thoughtful newcomers. We are a creative studio, and we will do our best to fulfill the wishes of our customers. We are grateful to have met and worked with them.
The sweet and thoughtful assistants, as well as the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, made the team a super nice group. It was a wonderful shooting experience and an unforgettable experience. The results of the shooting were much better than I had imagined. Thank you all for your hard work! 😘😘
Thank you, Xiao Yu, for your review. It's also a kind of fate to have met you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have placed in us is a journey of thousands of kilometers. I'm very happy to have met you, and I look forward to visiting Qinhuangdao again next time.

A programming novice who wants to share his personal experiences.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to receive training, but if you don't have such ideas, it's better to learn on your own. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it takes six months to learn.
However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with very weak self-control. Training is an even better choice for those with very weak self-control.
If you have a strong sense of self-discipline, you can also choose to study on your own, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First, we need to look at the institution's teaching force. If the teaching force is not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning. Of course, the teaching force of newly established training institutions is not particularly strong.
Second, before choosing a training institution, it is best to find out about the institution by talking to its students. After all, only the institution's students know how good or bad its courses are.
Hello, I don't really know how to answer your question because you haven't introduced your own situation. Learning this thing is closely related to one's personal situation.
For example, the field of study, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you are in will all be related to the industry you are studying or want to work in.
If you are a student and haven't graduated yet, or if you are a computer major who has already graduated, and if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective option. Nowadays, there are many offline and online training institutions that are quite good, but the cost of learning is high and the time commitment is significant, usually requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months.
However, if it were the case that I said these things, self-study would be very convenient. There are many free learning resources available online nowadays, and there are also many training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know where to find resources, you can contact me through the introduction and get free resources, or you can also get detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be studied comprehensively by combining them with videos.
If you are not in the computer field, but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning money and time, then I recommend that you go to a training institution to learn. Learning won't be too hard, and the teacher will explain things in great detail. If you have any questions, there will be someone to answer them, and the institution can also help with learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend students to companies after they complete their studies. This way, the job interview process afterward is much easier.
The above are my views on the matter. Since I do not know your specific situation, I only gave a brief overview in the beginning. If you have any other questions you would like to ask, please feel free to contact me at any time for further discussion.
I said I would be there before 1 p.m., and I saw it in the app too
What is
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
I provide various services (installation, cleaning, repair) for gas boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, exhaust fans, lighting fixtures, professional tiling, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who silently liked my post. Life is hard, but we have to keep going for the sake of living.
Life will not disappoint those who make an effort. If you like it, follow me, and thank you to those who silently gave me a like.
Life is like this: others only look at the results, while we have to endure the process alone. Faced with life, we have no choice but to be strong and keep going. We can look back on the road, but we cannot go back on it...
Cleaning is work, but it is also a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is beautiful because of sincerity.
Although we do the dirtiest job of cleaning, we always do it with the most serious attitude, leaving every corner of our customers' homes spotless. When we see their satisfied smiles and thumbs-up, all the hard work is worth it!
My daily work
—— Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, and preserve the beauty.
You care about the details, and Fengguixiangjing has done everything it can to make it "clean" for you, with service that loves your home.
Keep your home clean, build a reputation for housekeeping, provide good service, and keep your home clean.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning is part of my daily work.
Crystal chandeliers are beautiful, but if they are not cleaned for a long time, they become dull and lifeless. Only after cleaning can they shine brightly, just like life.
We can only succeed if we put our heart into it, and we can only create exquisiteness by being meticulous. We are serious about our caulking.
Give me a chance, and I will definitely satisfy you. Quality speaks for itself because professionalism is worth trusting, and your approval is my greatest encouragement!
It's not easy to do business in any field right now!
However, I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, perseverance, and effort, I will be better than others, at least I will be better than those who sit around complaining!
A day's plan is made in the morning, and all the good things begin in the morning. I hope you start the day with happiness, good fortune, good health, and contentment, and maintain a good mood all day long. Good morning!
As a child, happiness was a thing, having it made you happy; as an adult, happiness was a goal, achieving it made you happy; as you mature, you realize that happiness is a state of mind, and understanding it makes you happy.
Be the most genuine and kind person you can be, and follow your heart. You will have no regrets in this life; life is a journey, walk your own path; life has two treasures: a healthy body and a good mood. Live happily and healthily until old age!
At every stage of life, we encounter different challenges.
Often, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face challenges head-on.
Since we cannot avoid it, we might as well face it head on.
The more afraid you are, the more likely you are to be defeated by difficulties; if you face them head-on, problems will eventually be resolved.
Chinese curators team up to host Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters Wang Haizhous and Hu Guan): The first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennale, the Dhariyah Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on December 11 at the Dhariyah JAX Art Zone located in the northwestern part of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other places participated in the exhibition.
This biennial exhibition is jointly organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with the latter's director, Tian Feiyu, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which symbolizes the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period, and also reflects the current state of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with the exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Going Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among the exhibits, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists also attracted a lot of attention, with some artists using innovative methods to create artworks using recycled materials, such as Xu Bing in his 2014 work, The Infinite Landscape of the Back Hills Series, where he reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
Dhariyat Biennale Foundation CEO Buckley said he hoped this biennale would establish an international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's vibrant cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interactions between them.
Tian Fuyu said, "The goal of the Biennale is dual-fold: it aims to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and also to allow Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the biennial, with artists, curators, and creative industry leaders discussing topics such as intercultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Integrated and standardized management of rural public service jobs - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in employment and assistance for poverty-stricken people, consolidate and expand the achievements of the poverty alleviation campaign, and promote the rural revitalization, Yunnan Province recently issued policies related to the management of public interest jobs in rural areas to provide support for the comprehensive implementation of rural revitalization.
According to a relevant official from the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare jobs, which are used to provide employment for rural disadvantaged groups, including poverty-stricken laborers, and to help them achieve employment and income growth, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the capacity of rural public services in all areas. These jobs play an important role in this regard.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments, including the Human Resources and Social Security Department of Yunnan, the Rural Revitalization Department, the Finance Department, and they mainly standardize and unify the objectives, fund management, position development, and position management of recruiting personnel for public welfare positions at the grassroots level.
In terms of job development, the new regulations clearly stipulate that jobs should be set up according to the principles of "need-based establishment, job-based recruitment, dynamic management, and total quota control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible," and "one person, one post, voluntary publication, and unified management."
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, public display, appointment, pre-employment training, and assignment to a post.
In addition, the new regulation also specifies the specific duties of the main departments responsible for developing rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and requires that the relevant departments responsible for developing rural public welfare positions should purchase commercial accident insurance for the beneficiaries of such positions; it also requires that relevant departments should regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare positions.

Hello
Can the order be cancelled?
I reordered
Has it been canceled?
2. Although the right-wing has had its glory days in history, they have been short-lived, so it is because of a little bit of sunshine that it shines brightly, and a little bit of hot water that it sweats; it is because of a little bit of prosperity that it looks to Lintao and Sichuan, and because of a little bit of setbacks that it is reduced to nothing.
However, speaking frankly, the right has played a positive role in the progress of society.
From the perspective of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the truth standard, developing the economy, improving technology, and promoting the institutionalization of government and the protection of human rights, the rightists' positive significance should not be denied.
Three, as far as I am concerned, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I do care about what he says and respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about social issues in China.
However, I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that a counter-revolution is unnecessary, and that a revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, deterioration of living conditions, and a chaotic political landscape where all kinds of groups are mixed together. Then, foreign powers will take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility for the nation and the people. Those who attempt to take advantage of political opportunism for their own gain are not rightists, but scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left.
The left is actually a bunch of orphans of the times and politics.
If we say that the right has a positive impact on society, then the Communist Party would still listen to some of the right's views and analyze their ideas when necessary. But the left has no need for this, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has discarded!
Five, I recently saw some friends cursing the traitors while at the same time attacking the leftists, and they were even moving their qi, which I think is unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors or leftists. They are all the same, and there is no logic to their arguments.
We should not try to prove that we are right, and we should not try to make the villains and the left-wingers admit it. Why bother?
I tell my friends: When the thief curses you for five cents, and when the leftist curses you for being a right-wing dog, this proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people had ideals when they were young, but later in life they forgot their ideals or pursued them obsessively.
The ideal gradually recedes, and even the dragon slayer becomes a dragon.
Left and right generally refer to constraint and freedom, and from a historical and cultural perspective, China should be more left-leaning as a whole.
Domestic right-wing parties emphasize efficiency and development, while left-wing parties focus more on regulation and fairness, as well as safety.
Nowadays, society in general is more concerned with fairness, and the competition between China and the United States is definitely left-leaning, which will likely continue for many years to come.
Even though I don't understand, I can just like it and it's done.
What else is there to say? Hua Hua is just so upright.
Over the past two years, the US has imposed unprecedented sanctions and blockades on Huawei's chips, not only plunging Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also causing huge losses for "US-based" companies.
The US has suppressed China's semiconductor industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries' related companies to simultaneously impose sanctions on China's semiconductor industry, which has directly led to the consequences that the orders and profits of global semiconductor suppliers have been affected, resulting in reduced R&D investment and reduced production capacity for semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn has caused a disruption in the global semiconductor supply chain.
Now, the "chip shortage" has affected all major industries around the world, such as automobile manufacturers suspending production, mobile phone prices rising, and almost all industries that use chips being severely affected.
In order to regain "chip" sovereignty, more and more countries' tech giants are beginning to take the "de-Americanization" path.
To firmly control the global semiconductor dominance, and to restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently been making frequent moves. It recently hosted the "Semiconductor Summit" and invited 64 countries' giants to establish a semiconductor alliance. It also provided funding to support the development of domestic technology giants, such as Intel, which invested $20 billion to build two semiconductor fabrication plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its semiconductor foundry services to the outside world in order to regain its dominance in the semiconductor field.
Most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and might even take away its "bread and butter".
Intel is so confident because, as a long-standing technology giant in the United States, it has been deeply rooted in the semiconductor industry for decades and has a large talent pool and technical reserves. It is certain to rise quickly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, Intel's decision did not impress TSMC founder Morris Chang at all.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongming made a bold statement: Intel's investment in building a wafer factory is quite ironic. He did not mince words in expressing his opinion.
Zhang Zhongming's disdain for Intel's entry into the wafer field is due to the fact that Zhang Zhongming still harbors resentment toward TSMC and Intel from more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was a shining star in the American manufacturing industry, occupying a dominant position at the top of the global pyramid, and was the undisputed leader in the field of semiconductors.
By the 1980s, the world's advanced semiconductor chips were still in the hands of a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, whereby all aspects of chip design, manufacturing, and packaging were performed by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model puts a heavy burden on some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are forced to give up the idea of building large-scale production lines due to the huge cost involved.
Under the influence of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to show signs of specialization and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, it was possible to establish a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zetian's idea became a reality and TSMC was born.
TSMC has focused its main business on the "wafer processing" stage, which is a single step, and does not engage in design. It only provides wafer manufacturing contract services.
At that time, TSMC, which had just been founded, was just a small fry compared to Intel, the giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongming once approached Intel for investment, but Intel obviously had a rather high opinion of itself when it heard that TSMC only dealt with the manufacturing segment of the semiconductor industry, and promptly refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongming also concluded that Intel at the time looked down on wafer processing services.
Who would have thought that the giants who once looked down on wafer manufacturing services would now also have to start offering wafer foundry services?
So, Zhang Zhongming felt that Intel's entry into wafer foundry was ironic.
TSMC's market value has now surpassed that of Intel.
Faced with TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally cannot remain complacent.
Today, TSMC has already surged ahead to 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm chips from 7 years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
No more waiting

Let's take a look at some [Strange Trending Topics] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot topics were randomly selected: the Yuanxiao Festival on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, the price increase of Haolefu, and the Didi Chuxing incident. A wave of public opinion spreads and forms a peak, and then [the index drops] (smooth curve), eventually dissipating. If secondary public opinion is generated, a small peak will appear again.
They look exactly the same as the "Internet Opinion Evolution Model" that was once displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly selecting six hot topics from the same event, we present them in the shape of a "peak," a "sawtooth," and a "cliff."
[Peak-like] refers to artificial heating, which quickly rises to the top of the hot search list and attracts the attention of the public; [sawtooth-like] refers to periodic heating, which ensures that the topic stays at the top of the hot search list; [cliff-like] refers to collective withdrawal, which means that the hot search topic has completed its "mission" and is assigned a new task and sent to a new battlefield.
As shown in Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time difference is measured in seconds at most. It must be that a unified group of water army received a task and launched a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black PR can be seen in the fact that dozens of hot topics appear on the list at the same time: which ones are eye-catching, which ones are responsible for disseminating knowledge, which ones stir up controversy, which ones divert attention, which ones affect perception, which ones mislead judgment, which ones appeal to emotions, and which ones influence decision-making? Black PR accounts carry out their operations in batches and at different stages, taking into account all the factors involved in the spread of information.
Public relations is a science, and regardless of one's position, feelings, or other subjective factors, objective data alone can expose black PR.
Wherever we go, we leave traces behind. These traces, we dig out together.

Mauritius and other countries have reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron variant - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 12 - According to reports from Xinhua correspondents stationed overseas, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron variant infection in the country for the first time on the 10th.
According to Kailesh Jagutpal, the Minister of Health, one of the infected individuals was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa, and the other was a local resident who tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and returned to Mauritius.
After isolation treatment at the hospital, the two infected individuals tested negative for the coronavirus. They have now returned to their respective residences.
On the 10th, the Cyprus Ministry of Health announced that the country had confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron variant.
All three are students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. They did not go to the hospital for treatment because their symptoms were mild.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Serbian government has continuously strengthened its control measures.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, all passengers aged 12 or older who enter the country by air will need to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
On the 10th, the Serbian Ministry of Health also announced that it would begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health Kumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country had detected three cases of infection with the Omicron variant for the first time.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing of 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found these 3 infection cases.

I chose to come here because I trusted a friend's recommendation. At first, my budget was 70,000 yuan for a basic renovation.
Upon entering the store, they began a series of scams.
This was my first time visiting the store, and all I did was show them my floor plan. They didn't even go to the site to measure the house, yet they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135-square-meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They only gave me a rough idea of their materials, and I had no idea what brand they were.
Their second trick is that as soon as you enter the store, they will drag you into paying the deposit (and once you pay, you will never get it back unless you have enough experience to engage in a debate with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay a deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that if I paid the deposit today, they would give me a certain amount of discount.
This is a big hole, and I am a living example of being cheated. I paid a deposit of more than ten thousand yuan in a fit of impulsiveness.
His offer had many problems. The price of 70,000 did not include water and electricity renovations, nor did it include any doors or kitchen cabinets. These three items are the biggest expenses in basic renovations.
In addition, their service charges are higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company because they didn't explain anything to me at the beginning and just made me sign the contract.
When I went to ask for my money back, they acted very experienced, with a special team to deal with you.
No matter what, it is the customer's problem if they bite off more than they can chew, and they are in no way to blame.
There are all kinds of excuses, and there are many details that I don't want to go into, but in short, don't choose them, because my friend's house that they renovated was of poor quality, and they charged all kinds of fees afterwards.
It's a scam, they are just the original fraudulent dragon head decorations, now changed to Da Mei, as if they went bankrupt and then changed to something else.
So don't choose such shady decoration companies.
In the future, when people choose, they should search on Baidu for these things and check these things because renovation is not cheap.

Xingkong Haoyue | The Geminids meteor shower will peak on the 14th - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy popularization experts said that as the last major meteor shower of the year, the Geminids meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14, and friends who enjoy meteor showers can observe it after midnight on that day.
Beijing amateur astronomer An Jiu photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers originate from periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminids is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not caused by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society council member and astronomy popularization expert Xiaoling Shou explained that, just like the Lunar New Year blockbusters, the Geminids meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year. The "release period" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability, and is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, along with the Orionids and the Geminids.
One of the notable features of the Geminids meteor shower is that the meteors move relatively slowly, are colorful, and there are many fire meteors, making them suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
On December 13, 2020, Yang Ying, an amateur astronomer from Tianjin, took this photo of the Geminid meteor shower in Jinzhou, Tianjin.
The astronomical forecast shows that the Geminids meteor shower this year will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observing conditions when the radiant point is directly overhead) of 150.
The Gemini meteor shower recommendation index chart.
Last year, the Geminid meteor shower, nicknamed "Falling Stars," left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight, and the spectacle will be somewhat dampened.
On the 14th, it was the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, and the moon phase was a waxing crescent. The bright moonlight would interfere with observation, but fortunately, the moon would set in the second half of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminids meteor shower would also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after midnight when the moon sets, but they should pay attention to keeping warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe the eclipse in the city. Instead, you can choose a place in the suburbs or countryside with a high altitude, low light pollution, and an open view to the northeast, and then patiently wait until after the moon has set to observe it visually.
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow rate in all directions, so you don't need to keep staring at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower while observing.
If you are a friend who likes photography, you should choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens to capture the beautiful "meteor shower panoramas". Use a high ISO and the largest aperture when shooting.
For stability and continuity, a tripod, spare batteries, and a cable release are also indispensable.  ”
Xiu Li Peng reminded.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional television that the poster refers to should be liquid crystal television. The market positioning differences between laser television and liquid crystal television are mainly as follows:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared to the market positioning of liquid crystal televisions that are widely available, laser televisions are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or, in other words, laser televisions are products that were created specifically for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV sizes are between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the sizes of laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing steadily worldwide, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast by CINNO Research, the sales volume of laser TVs will grow by more than 140% in 2020, continuing its high-speed growth.
Its good performance in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent eye-protection features of laser TVs.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV's diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly enter the eye. Compared to the backlight source of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Saisi Laboratory of the China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmology experts at Peking Union Medical College Hospital conducted a strict comparative experiment under identical conditions to watch laser TV and LCD TV, and obtained 144 sets of test data for the population.
Data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have strong eye-protective properties, and in some respects even have a certain improvement effect.
In the current climate where vision health is increasingly valued, laser TVs are not only attracting more and more users with their eye-friendly features, but also opening up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the falling prices of liquid crystal televisions, the prices of laser televisions currently on the market are mostly above 10,000 yuan, and they gradually rise as the size and light source are upgraded.
Why are laser TVs so expensive to buy?
It's definitely true.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TV has many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
Thanks to ultra-short-throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is relatively shorter than that of traditional projection devices, enabling a 100-inch big-screen experience within a short distance. The required space is not large, and the main unit is small and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, high-end laser TVs can reach over 2000 nits.
In addition, the heat output is lower, resulting in less equipment damage and a longer lifespan for the television.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with advanced technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and biomimetic screens, which can provide users with more immersive visual and auditory experiences.
It's not a case of fake demand, but rather a product that has been segmented according to demand. In terms of picture quality and cost-benefit ratio, laser TV is not for audiovisual enthusiasts. If you want to strike a balance between large screen and viewing environment, you can give it a try. Everything has its pros and cons. After weighing the pros and cons, you can make your own judgement. Just don't be swayed by one-sided arguments.
In a nutshell, ultra-wide angle short-throw projectors—laser TVs—have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and mirrors to get close to the screen, which is not in accordance with the best optical design.
To block some ambient light, the use of a Fresnel screen with microstructures is expensive, and a 80-inch screen can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD at the same price.
Another thing I dislike about projector manufacturers is that they use the fact that the light reflected from the screen is good for the eyes as a selling point. Please, the light from the screen that the eyes can see is direct light, and if you reflect it to the ceiling, the eyes won't be able to see it either. It's the same for LCD TVs, the light reflected from the screen is also direct light, and when you open the TV, isn't the ceiling illuminated too?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflective, it cannot form an image.
Ironically, the hot spot (light spot) effect of high gain projection screens has been overlooked. It is only when a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle that it becomes really uncomfortable.
Wen Chuang Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery is a premium quality store with no branches yet
After adding the WeChat booking date, the lady sent me the available time slots for me to choose from, and the replies were quite prompt.
Before going there, I looked at the studio's photography work, which was mostly outdoor wedding photography. The photos were very beautiful and the styles of photography varied greatly.
After arriving that day, I briefly exchanged ideas with my younger sister and she was very patient in helping me try on two sets of clothes that I was indecisive about. We finally settled on the makeup and hairstyle, and the photographer would set up some props before shooting, guide the poses, and pay attention to every detail.
However, because I didn't communicate my specific shooting ideas to him, the result wasn't the style I wanted, but it should still look good 🙊🙊
After the photoshoot, the photographer will help select the photos, discuss the post-production style, and be quite attentive.
It takes about half a month to repair a film, and then you have to wait for the results.
The second time, I got to have a king-size meal in the form of a photo shoot! Most of the clothes in the store could be chosen for a photo shoot.
In the end, I chose a black chiffon skirt to experience different styles.
The entire shooting process took about two hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of the shooting was my younger brother, born in the 95 generation, and I felt a little awkward, but I hope that in the future he can give more suggestions to customers on how to pose for photos. He's quite talkative, and the shooting process was quite enjoyable.

We're on the homepage now, so let's also take a look at Queenie!
When I arrived, I filled in my name and phone number and then chose the clothes. The wedding dress can also be chosen. I tried on three or four sets of clothes, and the stylist was quite patient. After choosing, I had my makeup done for a long time, and the service attitude was also good. Later, they taught me how to pose for the photos and said that the retouching would take half a month, but it was delivered within three or four days, and it seemed that there was no difference between the photos and the original ones.
The environment is generally good.
There are many options for clothing.
There are about three makeup positions inside, and there is a photography studio inside.
[Service] They are very friendly and attentive.
The stylist was very patient.
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching you the poses.
If the photographer is not satisfied, he or she will also proactively suggest a retake.
[Experience] The makeup may be a bit over the top; the original double eyelids were turned into triple eyelids.
The eyebrows are also shaved, which is a bit awkward for those who don't usually draw eyebrows.
The photos were delivered within ten days, but the retouching effect was not very satisfactory. It still looked like I had double eyelids.
Because I wasn't sure what style I wanted, I tried two sets. After trying them on, I kept going back and forth, and finally chose the black evening gown. The lady said that this one was more in the style of the old Hollywood glamour.
After choosing the clothes, it was time to do the hair and makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist sisters were super patient in helping me, and I was very satisfied with the results.
After getting ready, we started taking photos right away. The photographer directed me throughout the process, which was very easy and harmonious.
After the shoot, I carefully selected four of my favorite photos for retouching. The little brother said that the photos would be ready within 15 minutes. The result was very satisfactory!
I have not received a response for 3 days... Because your system cannot identify my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly subscription plan!
The strangest thing is that I always used the same credit card to pay each time
I now have to pay shipping every time
Can I be exempted from the monthly fee until you have finished your investigation? Is that okay?
Are umbrellas with small covers safe to buy insurance for?
Xiaoyoubing is an internet-based insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of the conditions set: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Companies (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, one must meet three key words: the shareholders and founders must have no major criminal records in the past three years, the minimum registered capital must be RMB500 million, and the company must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually quite strict. In a nutshell, they require a company to have strength, to be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (the national authority that oversees all insurance companies and banks in the country), and for its shareholders to have good conduct. As a small umbrella insurance brokerage, Xiaoyuanshen Insurance Brokerage Co., Ltd., policyholders do not need to question whether it is a legitimate insurance company or not. After all, there are these three requirements, which not every insurance company can meet.
In this respect, it is not bad, and it is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyoumeng Insurance is like an insurance supermarket. Many of the star critical illness insurance products from various companies are sold on this platform, such as the newly listed andtai Super Mary 5 Critical Illness Insurance. Both the insurer and the reinsurer are andtai Life Insurance, and Xiaoyoumeng Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to doubt its credibility.
From the perspective of payment methods, the products of Internet platforms are generally more cost-effective than those of offline platforms because they do not incur the costs of operating branches and the salaries of sales agents. The payment methods are also flexible, supporting monthly payments, which relieves the payment burden on policyholders and maximizes the leverage of insurance.
This is still quite good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of the agent's professionalism: this is particularly important, because the insurance industry has very high requirements for professionalism, and many Internet product customers can insure themselves, which can lead to many misconceptions in the areas of health disclosure and occupation. Non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective opinions when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or meet the requirements, which can lead to many risks of claims denial.
I myself worked as an insurance phone salesperson for "Tencent Microinsurance" (just like Xiaoye Umbrella, it is an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I can assure you that I was very responsible.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but the people are not. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there are many sales misleading.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 60 million, buying insurance gets you a phone, and you can get 600,000 yuan of critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are superficial and do not tell the policyholders that the first month is 1 yuan and the second month is normal pricing, ranging from dozens to 200 yuan, and many customers do not know what they are paying for after a few years.
They thought they could get away with paying 1 yuan, but the insurance company ended up paying 6 million yuan (the world's biggest windfall).
Free mobile phones are only given to those with special policy numbers, such as 6666 or 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, if you don't redeem it yourself, no one will remind you.
(This is another trap for the insured party.) Free coverage of 600,000 yuan in critical illness insurance is short-term, and if that's all there is, without any other commercial insurance, if a critical illness does occur, what can 600,000 yuan do? It can't solve the problem, and the insured person's future life will be left bare.
The government is also strictly cracking down on misleading internet insurance sales.
So, overall, the platform is fine, the products are fine, the problem lies in the professionalism and ethics of the salespeople.
The OP suggests that the topic starter should carefully consider the pros and cons of both online and offline insurance brokerage companies. There are more products available from offline insurance brokerage companies, and customers have more choices and more products to choose from. Some of their products also have better value than internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers myself to purchase offline products, saving them 2,000 to 3,000 yuan in premiums each year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me and communicate with me.
I am an insurance broker at Mingya Insurance Brokerage. I have three years of experience in corporate management training, and have served more than a thousand corporate clients. I have collaborated with more than 100 insurance companies, and before insuring, I will start from the customer's needs to tailor-make insurance products for them. During the insurance process, I will compare and select the best insurance company for the customer, and strive to obtain the best underwriting result for the customer. After insuring, I will organize the insurance policy, provide custodial services, and make sure the customer is worry-free.
Grow with each customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can be of some help to the original poster!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, internet insurance is an insurance business where the insured can complete the entire insurance process independently after clicking the insurance link.
During this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either. All the steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although the process of purchasing insurance online lacks the "ceremonial" aspect, and there may not even be a printed version of the contract, this has no effect on the validity and legal force of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the assembly line operations of "phone sales", but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way: the subsequent service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, shouldn't we think carefully about whether the "intermediary" we choose is a "insurance agent" who can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services many years later?

Thank you for your help
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and insults, and I cannot accept such acts of personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this scoundrel.
If we ignore political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized behavior.
From the moment you started sending me Facebook friend requests and posting sarcastic posts, to your attempts to post the so-called location of my house and my father's name on social media, I have adopted a policy of not responding.
After that, you became even more persistent in tagging me at a rate of six meals a day, and continued to discuss some obscure, humiliating comments about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as my appearance, body shape, good upbringing, and whether to have strawberries in bed or not. ... I've had enough.
Little did I know that later I would receive messages from several friends on Facebook about uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing comments to your friend list.
Sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After my news report was uploaded, you showed no restraint and became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, or what your status is, in our society, we need to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue with this sarcastic, cryptic, humiliating, insulting, and abusive language. You can continue to say that you only care about and are concerned about me, you can continue to believe that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that the pictures are yours or continue to post any abusive comments.
No, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and I don't need your comments on my appearance.
I don't even think there is a girl who would be willing to let others humiliate her so much just to become famous.
My friend asked me, are you okay?
I said yes, and you wouldn't believe me.
I don't think any girl would say she was fine after being bullied like that.
No matter in the workplace, society, politics, or business, only those who lack even basic morals would choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice lies in the hearts of men.
I have selected some comments for you to judge for yourself
Your own posts should not be able to be impersonated by anyone, right?
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.

Vietnam News Agency - Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh Attends the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
During the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major conferences were held, discussing topics related to digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, as well as digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of Communications and Media Nguyen Manh Hung said that in 2021, despite the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to spread, the number of digital technology companies in Vietnam and their revenue grew by nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam undertook the cultivation of typical digital products, concentrating on solving the country's major problems, and many digital products have gone beyond its borders. Vietnam's digital technology ranking has also improved.
Minister Vuong Minh Hung called on digital technology companies to shoulder the responsibility of developing a digital transformation platform for these countries, and taking on the task of developing these countries' digital platforms is akin to fulfilling a national mission.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and government agencies, as well as enterprises, organizations, and individuals who are currently researching, developing, applying, and transferring digital technologies, shared their ideas and solutions for mobilizing and pooling all social resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, and jointly promoting the country's digital transformation, such as post-pandemic economic recovery, etc.
Premier Wan Mingxiang stressed in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and an objective need for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation serves the people, so it requires the mobilization of the entire population to participate.
The people and enterprises are the core, subject, target, and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the people and businesses.
Premier Fan Mingzhen stressed that digital transformation must reflect the spirit of the nation, and that it should be driven by internal strength, with strategic, long-term, and decisive factors as the main focus, with external forces playing an important and breakthrough role.
He also believes that digital transformation should drive horizontal and vertical development and sustainable development. It should be involved in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery and development, response to post-pandemic changes, overcoming the exhaustion of natural resources, and promoting green transformation and the development of green energy.
Digital transformation requires the establishment of databases for protecting and promoting the cultural values, historical traditions, national customs, and landscapes of a country, as well as the digital transformation of the banking, taxation, land management and development, and logistics sectors.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make the people happier and the nation more prosperous.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzhen called on all levels of government, all levels of agencies, and enterprises to increase the leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, raise their awareness of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve policies related to digital transformation, strengthen national governance, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises with a spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity, and proactivity.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the award ceremony for the 2021 "Vietnam Made" Excellent Digital Products and the opening ceremony of the "Vietnam Made" Digital Products Exhibition.

The home appliances here are quite comprehensive, there are many brands, and all famous brands are available.
On Double Twelve, I went to the "Hansdton" water purifier store to look at water purifiers. The store was having a promotion, and the prices were quite reasonable.
Homeplus has a total of 11 floors, with levels -2 to 9 being for parking. Parking is free during the day on levels -1 and -2!
The surroundings are not very good. There are only a few hardware stores and restaurants, and the food is average.
This elevator is also very frustrating, just like having a major illness. It goes from minus two to minus one, back and forth, and I keep pressing the button for this floor, going down from the safety corridor to the first floor, which is also very frustrating. It goes directly to a furniture store, but the store is closed and the safety corridor is blocked!
Home Rent still needs to be improved. There are many areas that have not been developed.
Address: No. 555 High-speed Railway North Road, Shayibak District, transportation is convenient and there is a large parking lot, which is free during the day.

There are so many brands that I can only remember this many. It is a good place to buy products, and if you get tired from shopping, you can take a rest on the sofa.
I recently wanted to buy a comfortable sofa, and a friend said there are many sofas to choose from here. I looked at GUOJIA HOME and MICKE MICKE, and they seemed okay, but they are a bit expensive, so I am still hesitating.

The Yangtze River mainstream has achieved full coverage of green waterway integrated service areas - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian): The Chongqing Wulong Waterway Green Comprehensive Service Area was successfully completed and put into operation on December 10, marking the official opening of the second waterway green comprehensive service area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, after the Sichuan Luzhou Waterway Green Comprehensive Service Area was officially put into operation on December 8.
By now, the waterway green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport, said that previously, the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had built and put into operation 10 waterway green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which had been widely recognized by sailors, and played an important role in promoting high-quality development of the Yangtze River shipping industry.
The full coverage of the green comprehensive service area on the water is another milestone event in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River, and it has significantly improved the ability to receive ship pollutants and provide shipping services.
It is introduced that the waterway green comprehensive service area is an important facility that provides comprehensive production and living services for the vast number of ships and crew, and helps solve the "urgent, difficult, and perplexing" problems of the crew.
The two waterway green service areas that have been completed and put into operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are integrated with life services, production services, and administrative services, and are themed on green and environmental protection. They are characterized by ship repair and emergency rescue services for ships, and will enable ships to enjoy "one-stop docking and multiple services" in the port, making it more efficient and convenient for crew members to work and live year-round on the Yangtze River.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering near China; the most powerful weapon in the U.S. Navy's arsenal makes a rare visit to Guam - 2022-01-17 - Multi-Dimensional - Pro-China media Multi-Dimensional reports the latest news on U.S.-China relations: The latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering near China; U.S. media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank, on January 9, a satellite detected the US Navy's "Carl Vinson" (USS Carl Vinson) aircraft carrier in the vicinity of the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform expects the "Carl Vinson" to deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier has deployed the F-35C fighter jet and the CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier-based transport aircraft.
In addition to the "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier, which is currently cruising in the Pacific, there is also the "Abraham Lincoln" (USS Abraham Lincoln) aircraft carrier, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which is part of the 314th Strike Fighter Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the United States Navy currently deploys the "Ronald Reagan" (USS Ronald Reagan) aircraft carrier, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan, in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Champlain" missile cruiser and the "Stockdale" missile destroyer, among others.
The three US aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon is making a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that the three US aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) Three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China. The most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam on January 17, 2022.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal, which is normally rarely seen, visited Guam over the weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, which carries 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US Naval Base Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China, and the most powerful weapon is making a rare visit to Guam. Analysts say this sends a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of a US ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China. The most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The photo shows China's Yongxu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada" to Guam this time enhanced the cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, showcased the United States' capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and its commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are usually referred to as "boomers" (submarines).
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunderbolt" submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding the submarine-launched ballistic missile made the "Rhino" submarine the "most important survival weapon" in the nuclear triad system, which also includes land-based launch pads for ballistic missiles, as well as the B-2 and B-52 bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
Recently, Meta plummeted by 26%, and its market value evaporated by $25.1 billion. Why did Zuckerberg respond by saying "we face unprecedented competition"?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its main source of income is advertising. Today, advertising companies that make money are those that have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, no matter what kind of function they serve, they are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance". Many apps are connected to Meta's advertising platform, which enables them to monetize through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because of Apple's privacy policy adjustment, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether they allow an app to access their information. Most people's normal reaction will definitely be to refuse.
Next, if Google sticks another knife in, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also been weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does indeed exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not entirely accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly from companies that conduct business overseas in China.
Meta has about several hundred employees in its office in Hong Kong, and several major agents on the mainland.
For Chinese companies looking to expand into overseas markets, Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, and most of the money they spend goes to Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TT is now one of Meta's major competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from TT in the past two years.
All the domestic agents are helping ByteDance advertise on Meta's platforms, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region is also very good.
I haven't recently gone out of my way to find out, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The phase of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been smooth.
Facebook is getting older and older, and the new platforms, including TT, are no longer in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just declining income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not just interested in income, but more importantly, in the future expectations.
Clearly, Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the directions for the future, but the implementation period for the metaverse is relatively long, and this story is unlikely to support Meta's valuation for the next two or three years.
So, in the next two years, Meta's situation will be quite difficult.
Don't be fooled by Facebook's current success. It has annual revenues of between $100 billion and $200 billion, but in reality, Facebook is very vulnerable compared to other Internet companies and high-tech firms. It doesn't have much of a safety net.
Although his few social media apps now have relatively high daily active users and are mainstream, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and so on, Facebook has little confidence in the face of TikTok's rapid development. Disruption can happen in the blink of an eye.
As for the concept of the metaverse, which is unattainable, there is no hope of success in the short term, so Facebook is very risky. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg has changed the company's name and has been constantly looking for new tracks, but I think his choice of track is wrong, a dead end. The above are my thoughts for your reference.
