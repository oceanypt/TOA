In my opinion, the literature curriculum was formed by ladies of the Balzac age by women of that age based on their interests.
From 19th-century Russian literature, we preferred Danilovsky and Vulkovsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the perspective of those very ladies of a certain Balzac age.
And the psychology and torments of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not as interesting to teenagers.
Teenagers in general are rarely interested in the psychology of the characters.
Thank you very much, it's very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were stuffed to represent a particular variety?
There are roses of such a color and with such a petal structure that resembles velvet, usually in dark red or burgundy shades.
And the light roses look different, the petals have a distinctly satiny or silky sheen.

The Promtex Micropacket Prestige mattress, 105 x 195 cm.
The "Micropack Prestige" model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different firmness on each side: the medium-firm side is made of latexized coconut fiber and natural latex, while the moderately soft side is made of a natural latex plate.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the formation of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the model's advantages are breathable materials.
Latex perforated for breathability is naturally well ventilated, just like coconut coir.
This preserves a healthy microclimate in the sleeping area.
The mattress also comes with an extended warranty.
The official manufacturer's warranty period is 5 years, but in practice, the mattress can be used for longer.
Dust and dirt protection is provided by a removable Jacquard cover that is included in the set.
Buy an orthopedic pillow to go with the mattress - it is recommended for maintaining optimal spinal alignment during sleep.
The fill determines the purpose of the sides – coconut provides anatomical support for the back, while latex relaxes the muscles.
Turn on your brain and drive such relatives out of town!
Better to have none at all than these...
Either find an independent driver or someone who is willing to invest and work with you on a partnership basis.

Next time you'll think better...
Andrey, you were clearly explained that pensioners work in schools, and they will not work in the command line.
The computer teacher can't help either, he wasn't taught this, the schoolkids play games on Windows.
So there is no support.
I shudder to think of those feasts and guests at my parents' house.
Guests are at the door, and the meat is still being browned on the stove, while Mom, flustered, finishes mopping the floor.
Lord, I was already exhausted when I sat down at the table.
Then I'll wash the dishes, and then I'll clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you lug the groceries, two days you cook, and then you clean up for a day.
And what about the guests?
They're doing well, and they always have a cake with them.
Since then, I have not liked holidays or guests.
Even for my family, I set the table with the bare minimum.
And I prepare treats for them, and I bake very often just for the fun of it.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccination is inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in summer or fall 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination campaign in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite Germany's active vaccination campaign, two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely not enough for full protection.
This is the conviction of Ulrich Weigel, head of the Association of General Practitioners.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, by Die Welt.
"We expect that a fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus will be possible "in combination with a vaccination against the flu."
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omicron."
And the new variant is particularly dangerous.
The likelihood of reinfection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta variants.
This is indicated by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech / Pfizer producers plan to provide an adapted vaccine for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new "Omicron" variant of the coronavirus.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that the effectiveness of the vaccine is significantly lower after two doses: "the neutralizing potential is reduced more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron variant," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the head of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates for shortening the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will affect the spread of both the delta and omicron variants of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience is very convincingly demonstrating this," the expert emphasized.
The Pontoon21 Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g, is a lure.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the Pontoon21® company.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally designed with ice fishing in mind, rather than just casting.
These wobblers have a greater specific weight than their close-sized counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top lip made of durable and resilient plastic, which creates additional vibration nuances when trolling vertically and horizontally.
As a "winter wobble" when fishing vertically, the Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a fairly aggressive action.
Often the most effective is simple monotonous animation, that is, movements of the rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very great, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, which is cluttered with underwater vegetation, rocks, and other obstacles that could cause a snag.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching pike and large perch in winter, and especially in midwinter, when a precise and aggressive presentation of the bait is required.
Reaching the extreme point of its trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns and returns to its original vertical position.
Bet-A-Vib is no less successful when used for winter fishing for pond trout.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose between two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without one (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib can provoke a passive pike, which does not even react to live bait, by playing it vertically.
When casting Bet-A-Vib demonstrates distance and accuracy when fishing.
This lure is easy to understand and not picky, and it works well with lines and braided lines of all diameters.
For casting for fish such as pike, perch, roach, or pikeperch, in addition to a uniform retrieve, a "step" and sometimes "tapping" the bottom are also effective.
If you fish in rocky areas, you can replace the front treble hook with a double hook, which will reduce the chances of snags.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most reliable in operation and, as a result, one of the most effective.
It can be used with equal success on relatively shallow and fairly deep sections.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young layabouts are sitting on the necks of elderly parents.
"Golden youth" are clearly lazy people in the majority, who know nothing and are incapable of anything.
A well-fed life encourages laziness.
Perhaps, Mishustin was referring to this significant portion of the population.
You're joking, right?
I have never seen any shoes in this store that I wanted to buy.
What long-term wear are you referring to?
This footwear is made of artificial leather.
It's good if it lasts one season.
"Zenden" is on the same level as "Kari".
A couple of times I've gone in, looked around, and realized there's nothing to do there.
Libya reported 7,000 Russian mercenaries
More than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner" are located in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khalid al-Mishri.
Currently, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the Wagner private military company in Libya.
They also have airplanes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet aircraft at the Gardabya air bases (which is also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu agency quotes him as saying.
Khalid al-Mishri also noted that Russian mercenaries "are trying to seize" the central part of Libya, extending from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "putting their man in power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain a presence
According to the publication's source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled on Libya."
"Wagner" has been in Libya since 2019, and uses the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufra, according to the agency's publication.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner private military company is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else can mercenaries be found?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is allegedly active in nine African countries - the CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, the Wagner Group's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use mineral and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies, and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the CAR.
This group is not listed in either the security services or the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not listed in the rosters of personnel lists.
This company is under US sanctions.
Recall that earlier, the Permanent Representatives of 27 EU countries approved sanctions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the European Union Council will approve this decision on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya de facto serves as the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions, with Islamists dominating it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single day of voting for the election of parliamentary deputies and the head of state from December 24 at least until February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left until the election, and the chances of it taking place on time are rapidly decreasing," the article notes.
Against this backdrop, the Libyan High Election Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, according to Sky News Arabia TV channel.
Russia's foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see the country's foreign policy as having more successes than failures, while 29% believe that failures predominate.
"Examples of successes: "We protected and restored peace in Syria," "We resolved the "Nord Stream-2" issue," "We scared the whole world with powerful weapons," "We took back Crimea."
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," and "isolation from the world," according to the Public Opinion Foundation study.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paper-based administration - all government services have also become fully digital
The Dubai government announced a complete abandonment of paper-based administration and a switch to digital technologies.
All state services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, on Saturday.
Now, all government agencies in Dubai will only handle internal and external document flow digitally through special information platforms.
The new initiative affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and utilities, the police, municipal bodies, courts, and so on. Many commercial entities also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document management began in Dubai in 2018.
Over this time, according to the authorities, 33.6 million sheets of paper have been saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in monetary terms.
Previously, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
As for dates of birth and how old the child is, that's already nonsense. The same goes for class and group in the nursery.
I don't believe that such lazy people exist.
And if they do exist, they clearly don't care about anything, including their family.
My mother, her two brothers, and my grandparents lived on 3 Vladimirskaya Street, on the first floor without bars.
They first knocked on the door, then on the window, then decided not to be polite and smashed the window and climbed in, but Grandpa had a baseball bat, which they received.
These people definitely knew that someone was home...
Turkey's car production and exports have fallen below the 2020 level
Turkey's car production and exports sharply declined in November amid the lira's depreciation.
As a result, the industry's results for the 11 months were worse than last year's, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November, Turkey produced 115,000 cars at factories, which was 20% less than the year before.
Approximately 75,9 thousand vehicles were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if, by the end of the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish automotive sector demonstrated positive dynamics compared to the previous year, then by the end of the 11th month of 2021, car production was already down by 0.3% compared to the previous year's figure.
The cause of such a decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity across all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received deferrals on credit payments in 2021
The First Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smaikov, spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports the MIA "Kazinform" correspondent.
"According to information from the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, in accordance with the instruction of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 dated April 9, 2021 "On the Approval of the Procedure for Providing Loan Payment Deferrals for Subjects of Small and Medium Business", - wrote Alikhan Smailov in his response to a parliamentary inquiry.
He reminded that the procedure for granting deferrals of loan payments provided for banks and microfinance organizations to provide deferrals of loan payments to subjects of the MSME sector, including individual entrepreneurs, from April 1 to June 30, 2021, for loans issued before April 1, 2021.
The deferral period was from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the SME subject.
In the borrower's statement, a different deferral period may have been indicated.
During the deferral period, the debtor's claims and litigation work was suspended, as was the notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments," the deputy prime minister noted.
In 2021, 603 small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) borrowers applied for deferrals of loan payments to second-tier banks, of which 553 SMEs received deferrals totaling 9.7 billion tenge.
131 small and medium-sized business subject has applied for a deferral at MFOs, and deferrals have been granted to 95 of them in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smaylov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immune systems are capable of easily tolerating the "okmiron" strain
The doctor suggested that people with weak immune systems may be more susceptible to it than those with a strong immune response
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the "okmicron" strain of the coronavirus could prove dangerous.
The cause lies in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an individual infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, in the case of a mutation, he encountered no resistance from the immune system.
As a result, it is more aggressive.
Because there was no response from the immune system, it became very fast.
Apparently, there are more spike proteins, spikes, than is normal there, and their antibodies did not cut them down during mutations, comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weak immune systems may be able to tolerate "okmiron" better than those with a strong protective response from the body.
It turns out that a strong response by the body to anything, to any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is how it is with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-olds die and 60-year-olds cough it off.
The immune response in young people is frenzied, it is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten a finger, he hits like a cannon firing at sparrows, concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects, and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial or viral.
In the first case, treatment is very successful and quick, but in the second case, symptoms can often only be alleviated - all hope lies with the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia is the onset of intoxication of the body - this is characterized by fever, weakness, and feeling unwell.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, a scratchy throat, and coughing.
Pain on the right or left side, as well as abdominal pain, can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, vaccination of the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old may begin by the end of the year.
Virologist, head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at MIPT, Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is particularly susceptible to COVID.
For teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is maximized.
This is the most socially active layer, just like preschoolers, said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at MIPT, to Moscow 24.
Huge thanks to the author for this article.
I was happy to refresh my memories...

At home, when gathering with friends, they would dance to their music.
Immunologists have proposed a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of COVID-19
The authors of the study studied the fat tissue left over from bariatric operations and discovered that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the fat tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory response in the process.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that the viruses of HIV and the flu can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system's response.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of this.
A biologist explained the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to the WHO, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome manifests itself gradually in the form of cognitive impairment, to the point that even in a familiar environment, a person has difficulty orienting themselves over time.
Golyshaykin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol levels, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
On the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and the absence of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, disrupted sleep patterns, and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in abstract thinking.
"There is discussion that hearing loss can be both an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," added the biologist.
To prevent the onset of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic, and engaging in social activities.
Previously, the professor of the department of neurology, neurosurgery, and medical genetics at the Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education RNIMU named after...

Egypt has returned around 30,000 illegally removed artifacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, in the Al-Hayat TV channel by the head inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gaouad.
Since 2011, Egypt has managed to recover 29,300 artifacts for the state.
This year alone, 5,300 artifacts from the ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gaouad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out illegally are registered in the archives.
Now, the department's employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "monitor auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that after returning, cultural values are restored and then put on display in museums.
According to him, one of the recovered artifacts was a prehistoric human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun that was sold at an auction in London.
On July 4, auction house Christie's held an auction at which a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (approximately 68 million rubles).
This caused discontent from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
Tutankhamun's head, depicted in the form of the sun god Amon, has been in a private collection since 1985 and has not been put up for auction since then.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively pursuing the repatriation of illegally removed ancient artifacts from the country in recent years.
According to authorities, 95% of the illegal antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers."
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and that's right, because the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are a separate nation (closely related to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see the census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The thing is that in Europe and the US, Swiss banks do not provide their employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, a bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank exercises the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to deal with work-related issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life, 1925, was a fruitful one in terms of creativity, but it was the most difficult for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego."
He is already outside any literary circles, he has spurned imaginism, he is his own thing, but he is known, in demand, sometimes harshly criticized by critics, even viciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their shoulders.
Over the course of a year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them true masterpieces, the Persian Motifs cycle was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, eight books were published, and the collection "Soviet Russia" was released.
And the greatest success came at the end of June 1925, when the State Publishing House signed a contract with Esenin to publish his works in three volumes.
No contemporary poet of Sergei Aleksandrovich's has been accorded such an honor, he's the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money—the contract stipulated a monthly salary of 1,000 rubles for 20 months (the plant director, for example, received 300 rubles a month, while the engineer received 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofia Tolstoy, and he had to establish a family life, support the sisters Katy and Sasha, and also his mother.
Life seemed to be getting back on track, there was plenty to be happy about, but for him everything was mostly colored in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Either the wind is whistling
Over the empty and deserted field,
Is it like a grove in September?
Alcohol scatters the brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin was in very bad shape, looked very ill, and had clearly deteriorated.
Frequent absences, nervous breakdowns are becoming more common.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis—alcoholism—was ever made for Sergei Aleksandrovich, there are no reliable documents to confirm it.
For example, those relating to May 1923, when Esenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, was recovering his health at a clinic near Paris under the supervision of Professor Pyotr Gannushkin (two years later, Esenin would again end up in his care, this time in Moscow).
However, there are plenty of testimonies of the poet's binges, the scandals arising from them, arrests by the police, and so on, scattered across dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 20s, the poet's terrifying romance with the green serpent developed rapidly.
In late summer 1923, Esenin briefly moved in with his friend, imaginist Ivan Starcev.
It is surprising, but Esenin, despite his very good income, never had his own housing in either Moscow or Petersburg, and always rented apartments, stayed in hotels, or stayed with friends.
Starcev remembers:
He only came to sleep over, and in most cases in an inebriated, delusional state.
One night, returning home at four in the morning, Esenin fell down on the staircase landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
Coming to his senses a little, he started coughing uncontrollably, spattering the entire sheet with blood...
And even Esenin himself, after his trip through Europe and the United States (at that time, there was a prohibition on alcohol in the United States, but Duncan brought along a decent supply of spirits), admitted:
I saw nothing there except cabarets and streets...
By the end, I was already forgetting people...
Well, he did drink, of course...
I drank because loneliness ate away at me."

PROMTEX-ORIENT Duet Latex Econom mattress, 100x195 cm
The PROMTEX-ORIENT Duet Latex Econom is a modern interpretation of the budget model in the premium line.
The mattress's base is a Duet double spring block with independent springs.
A smaller, softer spring is inserted inside the large spring.
This allows for an even distribution of weight on the mattress.
On both sides, the mattress is supplemented with a filler – artificial latex.
It is an analog of natural latex, but it is denser and less expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material enhances the comfort effect of the mattress.
Artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it does not absorb moisture or dust.
The mattress is ideal for a couple with a large weight difference (up to 30 kilograms).
Thanks to the "smart" springs, there is no wave effect here, where the light partner slides to the side of the heavy partner.
The pleasant, soft-to-the-touch Sense cover made of practical Jacquard is lined with a layer of synthetic padding.
Natural fabric does not accumulate static electricity.
This mattress model can be made in a rolled-up version (vacuum-packed roll).
Now my son is almost 16, and he has long since lost the desire to misbehave.
All the energy is focused on choosing what he will do to make a living.
He is much more responsible than I was in his years or my husband, who had periodic legal problems up until the wedding.
The father cares for his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love."
Why did the girl cry during the exam, even though she didn't fail it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't a school?
She'll have a tail.
So what?
He will retake it.
Millions of students know this.
What are we even talking about?
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as "weapons"
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Paweł Jabłoński, expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such "operations" next year.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the relevant statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonskiy, sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he is "actively searching for new paths."
The Polish official also believes that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many parts of the world."
As reported by the website kp.ru, earlier the European Union implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individual persons and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they announced their readiness to continue and expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve."
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"It's not like Sanya's hat": when a velvet jacket turns a man into a laughingstock
In 2021, velvet blazers dominated the social scene.
Probably the first to announce his new fashionable solution was Daniel Craig.
In September, at the premiere of the film No Time to Die, he appeared in a velvet mauve jacket and a traditional Bond-style bow tie.
After his example, Prince William followed suit twice, first putting on a green velvet jacket that did not conform to the royal dress code for the Earthshot Prize award ceremony, and then choosing a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charity Foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was also adopted by Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to collect his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
Incidentally, his sons were dressed in the same ones.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for velvet men's suits in Russia.
According to the service's analysts, information from which was provided to Gazeta.ru, they were purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue, and of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. Meanwhile, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets, and they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
They can be purchased not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are represented almost across the board this season, in brands such as Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most coveted is the Gucci model in which the brand ambassador Jared Leto, who appeared in one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci", walked the runway.
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, one can be sure that the velvet is made from silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technique, the fabric turns out to be dense with a fuzzy outer texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget-friendly options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they also last for a shorter time.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilia Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the most important thing is not its model or cut, but its appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you're going to a party or formal event - explains Vahoshkin. It's also suitable for those occasions when the invitation specifies a dress code of "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion, meeting which allows one to opt for a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first and foremost, needs to acquire the right advanced social circle with a certain level of affluence, - believe the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Mr. Brummell." Men who wear velvet jackets usually belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to the associated social events, where a dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakoshkin suggests pairing a velvet jacket with equally elegant items: classic trousers with pleats, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with bows, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Brammell's Beauties" are sure that it would be inappropriate for a civil servant to appear at a corporate event in a velvet jacket, but "yes," if it's a "leader from among those who run the event, the item is appropriate."
If a lower-ranking employee has the goal of advancing higher in the company's complex hierarchy or of getting financial bonuses, then it's best not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate this with the phrase "not up to Senya's standards," believe the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
The voice evokes very mixed feelings.
This is an unnatural timbre, so forced and strained.
And has absolutely nothing to do with the sweet face of a young girl.
Honestly, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But I wish you all the best in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well lobbied, i.e. paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy sources are also not a problem - gas, oil, and coal were cheaper than they are now.
There is a huge demand for fuel.
A penny drops.
And who is in the flyover?
As usual, an ordinary customer.
Does the sheriff care about the problems of the Indians?
Therefore, it is not appropriate to consider Western politicians as idiots who "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a decent salary.
I didn't see a single attractive person in the photos in the article.
They are just average within the context of the average passenger.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole train, then they probably won't get on with them, most likely.
But only because of mental disorders and ignorance of such "beauties," but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slave status and struggles against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who is unaware of his or her enslavement and languishes in a silent, unconscious, and mute life of slavery is simply a slave.
A slave who salivates when he self-satisfied describes the delights of slave life and extols the virtues of a good and kind master is a slave, a lout."
An immunologist said that a booster shot after 4-5 months will help protect against the "omicron" strain of coronavirus
Re-vaccination four to five months later may protect against the new "omicron" coronavirus variant.
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called a vaccination six months later, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period"
"In previous strains, this period was normal, but now it's best to do the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases, after four," the expert said, calling for parallel vaccination campaigns to be accompanied by booster shots.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has received two vaccinations and a booster, or has recovered and been vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and recovered, then they have 'hybrid immunity,' that is, there are many antibodies and enough neutralizing ones," the expert clarified.
The G7 warned Russia of the "serious consequences" of an invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the US, France, and Japan) published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that "Russia's military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and be costly" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement says.
Next, the ministers call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and comply with its international obligations regarding transparency in military activities," as President Biden of the United States said during a video call with President Putin of Russia on December 7.
"We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with the aim of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the ministers of foreign affairs of the G7 also state.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price to pay in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation in our common and comprehensive response," the statement also says.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "a united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia."
Pfizer vaccine was considered 32 times less effective against the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower than against other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was deemed less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant," Professor Malik Peiris said.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against a severe course of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking the delivery of NATO weapons to Kyiv
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel in blocking the acquisition of deadly weapons by Kyiv within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of counter-sniper systems and rifles for shooting down drones.
Meanwhile, it is noted that later Berlin softened its stance on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Defense Minister, Kyiv intends to pursue the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this refers to the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of allowing arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect arms deliveries from Berlin with Chancellor Scholz in office.
According to him, the previous German leadership explained their refusal to provide weapons by the risk of escalating the conflict in the Donbas, despite "Russia's occupation of part of Ukrainian territory."
Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position under the new chancellor, the diplomat is sure.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kyiv expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, they are counting on Germany "to be a technical partner," the president added.
It was also noted that earlier this year, the co-chair of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated for the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.

I feel sorry for her, she lived a life full of anger.
Mercedes filed a protest against the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix result
The German Mercedes team, whose driver Lewis Hamilton finished second at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix behind Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, has filed a protest against the final race result, according to the Formula 1 press service.
Mercedes believes that the rules of Formula 1, 48.12 and 48.8, were violated during the race.
In the first case, the German team challenges the judges' decision to return the round racers to one lap with the leaders.
According to the second, Verstappen overtook Hamilton before the allowed "restart zone".
We should add that the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, according to which Verstappen beat Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the Formula 1 World Championship, is now provisional, and the outcome of the Mercedes protest is unknown
The G7 warned Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine
The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, as stated in the final statement of the parties.
Participants in the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces near the country's borders.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," says a statement published on the UK government website.
The ministers of the G7 countries and the EU High Representative noted that they are "united in their condemnation of Russian military buildup and aggressive rhetoric directed at Ukraine."
The head of the UK Foreign Office, Elizabeth Truss, warned of "big consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine at a press conference in Liverpool.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to renounce aggression against Ukraine," she said (quote from TASS).
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, the foreign ministers of the G7 agreed that in order to resolve the crisis caused by the buildup of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
The discussion was about negotiations in the "Normandy format."
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke up for dialogue on Ukraine in the "Normandy format."
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "signed a confession of their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes."

Methods for recovering stolen money from online stores revealed
There are several ways to get money back that was stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in a conversation with RBK.
To reduce the risk of large losses if the details of a bank card fall into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account, which are not used for online shopping, in order to reduce the risk of large losses if the details of a bank card fall into the hands of criminals.
Part of the savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend keeping a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen during purchases in stores that do not use the 3D Secure security technology, you can initiate the refund process.
"In accordance with the rules established by payment systems, the responsibility for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use the service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, emphasized that the buyer has the right to file a complaint with the bank to dispute the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores refund the money to the customer themselves if the order has not yet been shipped for delivery.
On November 19, Katerina Mizulina, a member of the Public Chamber and director of the League for Safe Internet, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 appeals were received on various cases of fraud, ranging from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss the "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline Nord Stream 2.
Although Scholz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years to come, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he will call on Scholz to oppose the "Nord Stream-2" pipeline, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany has supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it will help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
However, the Polish judicial system remains one of the causes of disagreements.
The European Court fined Poland, determining that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party Law and Justice violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not publicly committed to stopping the operation of the "Nord Stream-2" pipeline in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia crosses the border of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the G7 on Sunday.
Dmitry, pay attention.
The view outside the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
We removed the wall between the kitchen and the room, so you can see the second window partially.
In general, those who are not familiar with the initial layout are skeptical.
And I know these apartments very well and can see quite clearly how they were reconfigured.
Let them have it all good.
It always surprises me when they write about ways to clean the sink, toilet, window sills, and taps.
You wash them once a year at Easter, I suppose, and it's like you have to scrub them clean.
Just don't get dirty.
The Ministry of Digital Development wants to reward writers with residences
The state will transfer federal property to the future Russian Writers' Support Fund, which will inherit the assets of the Union of Soviet Writers and the Soviet Literary Fund.
On its basis, writer's residencies will be established, the Ministry of Digital Development and Communications told the Parliamentary Gazette, which will become the foundation's founder.
The Ministry of Digital Development is preparing a draft presidential decree on the creation of the Russian Literature Support Fund.
The explanatory note specifies that the fund will be tasked with, among other things, ensuring the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Union of Soviet Writers and the Literary Fund.
A significant number of immovable property assets previously belonging to the USSR Literary Fund have passed into the ownership of the Russian Federation, including assets located in the writer’s village of Peredelkino, the Komanovo settlement in the Leningrad region, and others, the Press Service of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media told Parlamentskaya Gazeta.
The draft decree mandates that the Fund's charter reflect that it is "established for the purpose of promoting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers."
"Under "creating conditions for creative activity" it is understood to mean the creation of writer's residencies based on the transferred property in different regions of Russia, where there would be comfortable conditions for creative work," the Ministry of Digital Development explained to our publication.

Doctors warn of the danger of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergei Tokarev warned about the danger of uncontrolled use of anticoagulants after a COVID-19 infection and before vaccination against the coronavirus.
Physician-therapist, immunologist Irina Yartseva said that self-administered prevention of possible thrombosis after COVID-19 can trigger a stroke.
Yartseva explained that anticoagulant drugs are not prescribed to everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in the hospital, and had complications detected.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood thinners, which prevent excessive blood clot formation) as needed.
She said that now there is a madness going on - everyone is taking anticoagulants for a long time and as a result, they are getting complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (blood clots in the brain).
The chief preventive medicine specialist for the Urals region, the scientific director of the Society of Specialists in Preventive Medicine, Sergei Tokarev, in a conversation with URA.RU, said that Russians are currently often taking anticoagulants haphazardly, including before vaccination against the coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice from the Internet and start treating themselves.
There are citizens who, by their own decision, start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And during the pre-vaccination examination, doctors notice bruising.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of the appearance of any symptom.
Potatoes were called a superfood for protection against hypertension
Studies have shown that regular consumption of this common and accessible vegetable significantly reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.
Potatoes are found in every kitchen and possess amazing properties.
The product is rich in vitamins and microelements that promote the functioning of internal organs.
It helps with heart diseases by improving blood circulation and lowering cholesterol levels, reports the portal Semana.
Today, heart disease is the main cause of premature death in humans.
To improve the situation, it is not only necessary to treat the disease, but also to eat properly.
One of the assistants in such a situation will be ordinary potatoes.
According to scientists, this root vegetable contains a lot of vitamins B1, B3, B6, as well as a very important vitamin C for the body.
In addition, potatoes contain phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, as well as riboflavin, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.
Micronutrients help all the internal systems of the body to function effectively.
In addition to everything else, the root vegetable fights against natural age-related changes in the body, and contains a lot of beneficial fiber for the digestive system.
When consumed regularly, it can become a preventative for atherosclerosis and hypertension.

The plumber who found money in the wall of the church will receive $20,000
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will receive a reward.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in the large evangelical church Lakewood, where pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising that devout Christians will be rewarded with wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Coulie was repairing one of the church's toilets and discovered thousands of packages of money and checks hidden under the insulation.
He handed the find over to the church, and according to him, he did not even receive a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing."
We understand what you have done and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quotes him as saying.
Apparently, the discovery is related to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then, around 200,000 dollars in cash and 400,000 dollars in the form of checks stored in the church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not incur any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of $25,000 was offered for information about the criminals.
Justin Coley was not eligible for this amount because the award's validity period had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit Crime Stoppers of Houston, which once offered a reward of $5,000 and later received an additional $20,000 from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police interrogated Pastor Joel Austin about money found in the wall of the Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - that is her "characterization as a real person."
That's why the attitude towards it is so negative.
And it's not about the fact that "she is financially much richer than all the scribes," as it says here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves as arrogantly and provocatively as this lady.

In some way, I trust you more than just recipes "from the Internet."
A new case of human infection with the avian flu virus has been recorded in China
A new case of a person being infected with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus variant H5N6 has been recorded in China.
This was reported by RTHK radio station, citing a notification from the Hong Kong health authorities, TASS reports.
A 68-year-old resident of Huizhou City in the southern Guangdong Province, who kept domestic poultry at home, contracted the infection.
His condition is assessed by medical personnel as critical.
The first ever human infection with the H5N6 strain of the virus was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern Sichuan province.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports upon entering the country
In Brazil, a judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF), Luiz Roberto Barroso, has ruled that it is mandatory to request a COVID passport from those entering the country's territory.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Persons arriving from countries where the vaccine is not available are also exempted from the list.
"The situation is even more serious if we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival, and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist traffic," Barrozo noted.
Previously, Brazilian authorities required unvaccinated tourists infected with the coronavirus to observe a five-day quarantine.
A complete protection scheme against COVID-19 has been revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, and Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altshtein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed the complete scheme of protection from the coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and using a nasal vaccine.
When administered intranasally, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are produced. This does not occur when the vaccine is injected.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And after vaccination, we have the most antibodies (immunoglobulins G) inside us.
And if you take both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet about double vaccination," the doctor said.
The chief preventive medicine specialist for the Urals Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of nasal vaccination in combination with injection-based vaccination is the possibility of becoming non-carriers of COVID-19.
He added that this will help by making the body's defense presumably as strong as possible.
Earlier, the head of the health department of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseynov, said that a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic will be triggered by the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is the picture that is observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to the dog (who has been dead for a long time now) like this: if you're ready to exchange a warm home, food, affection, love, and games for a heat cycle, then go ahead.
But the pessel was a trained and generally smart horse.
I chose my society and went home.
In the video, a method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not just a figure of speech, believe me.
I stopped many owners to prevent them from chasing their dogs, although they insisted that there were 200,000 running away (pomskies), and I literally grabbed them by the hand and led them in the opposite direction.
In the end, "200,000" chose the owner, not the dog that was running somewhere out there.
Mass protests against vaccination continue unabated in Europe
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets of the Austrian capital Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the authorities' plans to make vaccination against COVID mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spanish citizens, outraged by the government's healthcare policies, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held signs saying "This is a false pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated."
A large protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a COVID certificate is mandatory to access bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightclubs.
The decision to introduce health passports was taken by authorities in several regions of the country amid an increase in the number of coronavirus infections.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action started peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of demonstrators started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S. even in Wikipedia there is no unanimous opinion on this matter.
Kashchevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, a medical doctor," probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue about it; I think they both deserve the title.
I agree with Zakharova on one thing: the Americans have only brought death and plunder to any country they have ever set foot in.

The WHO has already detected "omicron" in over sixty countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the new "omicron" coronavirus variant has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO reported on the spread of the strain, including its speed.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This, despite the fact that it only became actively spread in late November.
WHO also expresses concern about the high rate of spread of the new coronavirus variant.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may outpace the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the omicron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The same conclusion was also reached in the UK.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will replace "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of those infected in the UK alone will be around 1 million. This, despite the fact that officially, at present, several hundred people in the Kingdom are infected with the "omicron" variant, and according to estimates, up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "omicron" strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
Which the British healthcare system will be unable to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine's effectiveness against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower than against other types of the disease.
How "Sputnik V" in Russia reacts to "omicron" is currently unknown - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has only just begun testing the Russian vaccine against the "omicron" strain.

Our St. Petersburg, or more precisely, Leningrad communal apartment with Big Zelenina still maintains contact to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to preserve the warmth of relations between the older generations.
Perhaps this is related to the fact that there were no guests in the apartment, rooms were not rented out, and the siege brotherhood was not canceled either.
Unfortunately, we are seeing each other more and more at funerals.

Seven people died in Brazil as a result of flooding
At least seven people died and 175 were injured as a result of powerful rains that fell on the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and the neighboring state of Minas Gerais.
This is reported by TASS, citing rescue services.
In the middle of the week, a subtropical cyclone has been raging on the border of these states, resulting in precipitation levels in the region reaching 450 mm. In 25 municipalities in the state of Bahia, a state of emergency has been declared, and in some of them flooding has been the most destructive in 35 years.
Several bridges have been destroyed by the elements, two river dams have been damaged, and traffic has been disrupted on three routes.
According to rescuers, about 5,700 people were left homeless, and another 6,700 were forced to leave their homes.
The damage caused by the elements affected more than 85,000 residents of the region.

$135 billion went to apps - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending in apps grew by 25% worldwide, and the number of downloads increased by 8%.
The most popular services in the world turned out to be various video services.
Most users downloaded the video editor CapCut, and spent the most money on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed significant growth from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. User spending in apps grew even more significantly, by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began post-pandemic recovery.
"Will such a 'return to physical' growth of the economy of applications slow down? Not at all," the authors of the report believe.
India was the leader in terms of app downloads, accounting for around 20% of all downloads.
Next are the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS devices, as before, spent more than users of Android devices: 65% of all app expenditures were on iOS.
Among the apps, the video editor CapCut took first place in terms of downloads in 2021.
Two Indian apps follow it: the video service MX TakaTak and the online shopping app Meesho.
Telegram also makes it into the top 10 by number of downloads.
In general, if we judge by the number of downloads, VPN services are popular among users (two are in the top 10: VPN Master and NightOwl VPN), as well as services related to video creation and streaming (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two more such services are in the top 10: Moj and SnackVideo).
"Users spent the most money in live streaming and online streaming apps," the report authors note.
YouTube leads the way here, and in the top 5 in terms of user spending, video services TikTok, Disney+, HBO Max, and the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma also feature.
The top spots for the number of monthly active users are held by Telegram, Instagram, Zoom, TikTok, and the mobile version of Microsoft Office, which closes out the top 5.
In Russia, the AliExpress shopping app turned out to be the leader in terms of downloads over the course of a year.
Next comes the service Zenly, which shows the location of friends, and the same CapCut.
Also in the top 10 apps are: online karaoke app StarMaker, online fashion retailer Shein, the Maps for Minecraft PE app, the DiDi taxi booking service, the Pure Tuber YouTube client, the Dixi retailer app, and the Samokat online store.
People around the world have adapted to the pandemic by transitioning to a mobile lifestyle, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The sectors that achieved the greatest success were those that helped people to connect virtually and in person," commented Lexi Sidow, head of market research at App Annie, on the results of the report.
In 2021, the mobile gaming sector generated $9 billion in revenue. The leaders in terms of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, which have little or no plot and minimal video formatting.
In the top 3 most popular games in the world, Count Masters, Project Makeover, and Bridge Race made the list.
In Russia, the leading games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls, and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends for the coming year, the company's analysts named the growth of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growing popularity among Generation Z of financial apps, such as the investment app Robinhood, and the further increase in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians were warned about a new scam scheme
Criminals have started looking for new tricks for fraud in video messages.
Izvestia writes about this, citing experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, head of products at Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this, neural networks are able to accurately reproduce the behavioral characteristics of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfakes, criminals can call the victim's friends via video call or create a video with the copy of a person for the purpose of blackmailing them.
"Such fakes can easily trigger bullying, as a skilled perpetrator can put people in ridiculous, dangerous, or compromising fake scenarios," the expert said.
Varonis's lead systems engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically, people tend to trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this may create specific risks when it comes to technologies involving video.

Five actions are listed that can help avoid diabetes
Blood sugar level problems are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not give this much importance, and that is a mistake.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play the main role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to plain water positively affects metabolism.
Sweet products raise blood sugar levels to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the path to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The appearance of the disease is not only influenced by an unhealthy diet, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Experts recommend following a low-carb diet.
Such a diet not only helps to lose weight, but also protects against sudden fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the secretion of digestive juices, and the absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about "weekend migraines" in workaholics
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in one's well-being over the weekend
The cause of worsened well-being after workdays is often "weekend migraine," according to Zhuhra Pavlova, a well-known endocrinologist, PhD, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine at MGU, and scientific director of the Systemic Medicine Clinic, who shared this information in her Telegram channel.
According to her, this problem is especially common among workaholics, who on weekends experience headaches, fatigue, and exhaustion.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are quite a few objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changes in conditions.
Our lives change fundamentally over the weekend.
"We sleep for a long time, we spend the whole day lying on the sofa, we probably eat more and drink less, the doctor argued. "As a result of the lack of coffee, there is a slight withdrawal.
Due to overeating and lack of water - feeling heavy and run-down."
Late rising also plays a role.
For example, if you stand up three hours later than usual, there is a reaction called jet lag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factor plays the most significant role in deteriorating one's well-being, Pavlov recommended tracking what changes the most over the weekend.

South African scientists have announced the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
South Africa has reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
South African scientists conducted a study and reported on the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to (the level of) vaccine efficacy of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which... casts doubt on the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, according to the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
Meanwhile, experts clarified that the drug can save a person from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in familiar products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under an unfamiliar word in the product composition, hidden sugar may be indicated, an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition, and glycemic index.
The label may list several dozen names, in effect, all denoting sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other broken sugars such as dextrose (corn sugar), levulose (fruit sugar), melasse (black syrup), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, and to pay attention to labels and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter how the ingredient in a product is called – syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white – it is still sugar.
It is difficult to calculate the exact amount of sugar because it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. naturally contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may end up being significantly higher than what is indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose its importance for Germany in 25 years
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the import of gas is losing its importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely phase out gas, oil, and coal by 2045, making it a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to maintain its commitment to the fact that Ukraine will continue to transport Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is currently important for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Previously, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, during the coalition negotiations and discussions of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also noted that the pipeline currently "does not meet the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers hacked the Twitter account of the Prime Minister of India
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The criminals managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
In Modi's office, they were asked to ignore new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter responded quickly - access to the account was restored.
The Prime Minister of India's page was already hacked in 2020, and they called for donations to a fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on December 12 ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12 at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted against the independence of their territory during the referendum.
Meanwhile, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755) of those who voted expressed support for New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
Turnout was 43.90%, and more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia participated in the elections.
As the France-Presse news agency comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as pro-independence supporters called on voters not to participate in the vote, the agency reports.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago hinders a full-scale and "fair" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way to the third victory of supporters of New Caledonia in France, after referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, while in 2020, 53.3% did.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
On Sunday, December 12, it was reported at the Élysée Palace that French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to address the results of this referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has been a major theme in the French presidential campaign in recent weeks.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last European Union presence in the Pacific Ocean."
"New Caledonia must definitely remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated multiple times.
The same statement was made by Valérie Pécresse, the Republican Party candidate, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October calling for the Kaledonians to remain French.
On his side, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, on his part, expressed a "strong desire that the Caledonian choice be a choice for France."
Hello, Svetlana, oh!
I was a little... a lot rude to you, I'm still embarrassed and ashamed.
Thank you for not turning away from my channel.
On the topic: I am not an artist, I love to draw, but it turns out to be inspired mess.
But as an artist - not an artist at all: what would one change here?
But let's not forget that the food was NATURAL, so obesity was not as widespread as it is now.
Meanwhile, medicine was at zero - leeches, garlic, and infusions.
Now they would have been put on their feet in a flash.
And food has nothing to do with it.
In Turkey, the first drone in the world with laser weaponry was tested
In Turkey, successful tests were conducted of the world's first drone equipped with laser weapons.
The UAV "Eren" was tested at distances of 100 to 500 meters, reports Mir24.
The device is capable of neutralizing explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight height of the new model reaches 3,000 m.
After passing the relevant tests, the UAV should be put into service with the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosive devices without the involvement of sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among only six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

Readers of the WSJ criticized an article about relations between Russia and the US
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized a column by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the article expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and made a number of insulting remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries "to stand united against Russia."
Readers of the WSJ disagreed with the position of the American professor.
"There is a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quotes one of the readers as saying.
"Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land."
The United States and NATO allies will never engage in a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," another noted.
Patches can also be applied to the lips.
The hydrogel used in the production of Dearboo Peach & Hibiscus Brightening Hydrogel Eye Patch is a high-tech polymer that provides enhanced absorption and delivery of highly concentrated natural plant essence to the skin, which adheres tightly to the skin and provides a feeling of freshness.
When delivering nutrients to the skin, the hydrogel minimizes the accompanying loss of moisture and forces the essence to penetrate deep into the skin layers.

A magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred in the Kuril Islands region
A magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred near the Shikotan island in the Kuril archipelago.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was located at a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.
If he had been born into a poor American family and tried to make it in life, it is unknown where his petit-bourgeois thinking would have gone.

Ukraine will start producing new-generation jet-propelled drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, work will begin on creating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type, which are powered by jet engines.
On December 11, Alexey Arestovich, an advisor to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, reported on this.
That is, they are capable of acting against airborne objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the body and the like," Dialog.ua quotes him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drones, Arestovich said that they are jet-propelled, not piston-propelled.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after the Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all respects."
The first batch of drones should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in collaboration with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified information about the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the combined forces in the Donbas.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that construction of a plant for the production of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in the Kyiv region, where personnel will be trained, as well as tests and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar drones will be carried out.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum a "big real step forward."
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions escaped at the Changi Airport in Singapore.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions settled on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from it because a protective net was set up nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival of employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all Singaporean zoos, at the airport.
They immobilized the lions using tranquilizer-tipped darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, and no people were injured.
Experts warn of cancer risk from vitamin B9
Studies indicate that excessive amounts of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there are compelling evidence that people who do not suffer from a folate deficiency are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, such as colon cancer.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, dietician Beth Kitchin advises paying attention to the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer only increases if you significantly deviate from this number in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, and to always watch the dosage and avoid cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutritionist Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since it is also found in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, by April, up to 75,000 people may die due to the omicron variant
Projections by British scientists show that, due to the spread of the Omicron strain of the coronavirus, up to 75,000 people in England could die in the next five months if restrictions are not tightened over the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), as reported by TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast by experts who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies at the British Cabinet Office, by April 2022 the country will have recorded at least 25,000 deaths due to the omicron variant, and a total of around 175,000 hospitalizations will have occurred.
At the peak of the outbreak, hospitals will be treating more than 2,000 infected patients daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to avoid overloading the National Health Service if the omicron variant turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant, and existing vaccines are unable to exclude infection," said Rosanna Bernard, a mathematician from LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the rate of spread of the Omicron strain remains at the current level, by the end of the year there will be around 1 million cases detected in the country.
By mid-December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1898 cases of the omicron strain of the coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 were detected in the last 24 hours.
Meanwhile, on December 9, the head of the UK's Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality, this figure could already be as high as 10,000 cases.

Demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter worldwide
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking records worldwide, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and the fight against climate change.
In the worldwide yacht registry, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - 25% more than last year.
In the era of fighting the consequences of climate change, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and the money for a floating fortress worth over £50 million won't decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, orders for ships were up by 25% compared to the previous one.
Brokers say that such a frenzy on the market has not been seen in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of getting infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Before, all these people went to the office and met their business partners in person. Now, the vast majority of them work remotely and conduct negotiations over Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that clients are willing to pay more in order to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People simply crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior by the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, space travel, life on yachts, or flying in one's own private jets cause resentment in society, because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to take action and are proposing to introduce new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that it will be extremely difficult to do so given the mobility of money.
Meanwhile, it is impressive not only the number of superyachts ordered, but also their specifications.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a stern length of over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building the REV Ocean yacht, which is 183 meters long.
After launching, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool," as well as a submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
Helipads, open-air cinemas, and fighting platforms have become commonplace on existing superyachts, and on some, such as McGregor's yacht, there is a platform for martial arts. Professor of economic anthropology at the University of Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is negligible.
But it has symbolic significance, given that there are only slightly more than 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of excessive consumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emissions footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average resident of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emissions trace was attributed to his yacht Eclipse, which is 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner is not on board, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Owners of superyachts do not evoke sympathy from other people when they, like the richest woman in Australia, Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain on YouTube that there is no place for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships over 50 meters long.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified as a cause of colon cancer development
American scientists have determined how much alcoholic beverages per week increase the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express publication.
Experts have concluded that consuming four or more alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderate drinkers have a higher risk of developing colon cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of such a type of cancer, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process in the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, if not all, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they don't realize how advanced four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how developed the intelligence of animals is.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can respond sequentially to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' findings were published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they know nothing about politics, economics, and art, yet they often manage to fool their owners.
According to experts, representatives of some breeds show better results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data to make definitive conclusions.
Some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses, such as Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of learning ability they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is ready for trade with the US and Russia
The United States and Russia will "negotiate" the issue of Ukraine's accession to NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the publication "Glavred".
According to him, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations in the near future regarding US guarantees regarding Ukraine's non-entry into the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of US leader Joe Biden about the right of countries "to join wherever they want."
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you wouldn't negotiate, but just send the person offering away.
As for Ukraine, there is a deal in the works," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine and is aiming for dialogue with Kiev.
"The preparations are carried out secretly, quickly, and they immediately launch offensive operations rather than waiting for the formation to be detected and forces of resistance to be deployed," he noted.
China stimulates the development of the railway transport sector
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France, and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Transportation and Equipment Exhibition held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province /Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, noted company representative Hou Zhaowei.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operability of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its export of railway transportation vehicles, and many Asian and European countries are witnessing the "Chinese speed."
In May of this year, the first high-speed passenger trains designed in China and manufactured by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd rolled off the production line, destined for export to Europe.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on railways in Austria, Germany, Hungary, and other European countries.
In November, trial operation of the metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will travel along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The metro line along this line will open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey, with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness," said Feng Yaxiong, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China International Trade Promotion Commission /CITPC/.
"This sector constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment on the global market," said Feng Yaoying.
After more than 60 years of intense work, China has created a leading system for the production of railway transport equipment, with a full range of auxiliary facilities and large-scale production activities. This was achieved by conducting a number of independent research and development projects.
According to Feng Yaoyan, the country is first in terms of electrification of railways and in terms of mileage operated on high-speed and urban railways.
A biologist listed early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin, in a conversation with Radio Sputnik, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of mild cognitive impairments such as difficulty concentrating, planning, and reduced abstract thinking.
Currently, there is discussion about whether hearing loss can be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease or one of its risk factors, said the expert.
Golyshaykin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain's blood vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that at present, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start prevention at the right time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and actively communicating can help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense engagement of memory and logic thinking
"There are recommendations for the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still debated in the scientific community," said Golosheikin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular cognitive skill and ability training through games and hobbies that require intense engagement of memory and logic thinking," said Golosheikin.
Previously, a British charity that researches dementia said that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 and up.
Doctors have named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be vision problems, which cause the patient to have difficulties recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, according to experts, is aphasia, a condition in which a person cannot find the right words to express what they want to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychoneurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical council created by the Georgian ombudsman, told journalists.
Saakashvili's neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
Stable problems include mobility issues, coordination problems, and character instability," the expert said, noting that this does not exceed the normative limits and that the former president now needs special rehabilitation.
"We call this neuro-rehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, which is not possible in Georgia," said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special facility, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging the provision of medical care after prison service employees disciplined him.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.
Aleksandra, "You're even getting paid for this?" - I'm interested to know where people like that come from...

Or are we so holy that we feed on prana?
There is another side to the coin here.
These people are, after all, parasites on the body of society.
They don't work, they don't pay taxes, they live on benefits and at the expense of their relatives.
They receive full medical care at the same time.
How many mouths can a working person feed?
We feed all the alcoholics, and drug addicts who also lost their health due to their stupidity.
Then we are surprised by the extension of the retirement age.
These sums could have been spent on treating truly sick people.
Of course, the Red Banner of Victory will forever remain a part of our country's history and should not be confused with the state flag.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, reports the Europa Press agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports became mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightclubs.
Many of the demonstrators came to the rally without masks.
They accused the state of totalitarianism on their posters, calling for respect for the citizens' choice, and used slogans to do so.
In Valencia, vaccination certificates will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city spoke of a medical dictatorship, and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, since the start of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected, and over 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, restrictions are also planned for the unvaccinated.
On November 12, the government introduced bills on a unified QR code system to the State Duma.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit venues for mass events, cultural institutions, catering establishments, and retail outlets by presenting either a certificate of vaccination or a previous illness, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for trips on trains and planes.

Steep climb: How the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country.
In China, they hope that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow the collection of the 1 trillion yuan indicated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of the remote and underdeveloped provinces.
The Taiwo ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, there are also landscaping works being carried out: workers are planting trees.
The country has more than 700 ski resorts, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snowfall.
The main long-term goal is to provide comfortable and interesting holidays in Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Games organizing advisor Justin Downes says that since his last visit in 2007, China's ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every winter, more and more Chinese head to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite significant changes, it will take many more years to create a skiing culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation created there.
70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Chunli, not far from the sites of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, and now no one among the local residents is without work.
The country is opening more and more stores selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
Food outlets serving national cuisine are opening on the slopes.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwu.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders at the world's largest competitions, and resorts and equipment must reach world-class standards.
More than 500 million people worldwide may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO said
More than 500 million people around the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has set back human progress in the area of universal access to healthcare, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have said.
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage, celebrated on December 12, WHO and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, and has caused excessive strain on healthcare systems.
As a result, for the first time in 10 years, the population coverage by immunization has decreased, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria have increased.
The WHO and the World Bank emphasized that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become harder for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets."
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and that nearly four billion people have virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister was disconnected from the "Democracy Summit" broadcast at the request of the White House
The speech of Taiwan's Digital Technology Minister Audrey Tang at a panel discussion during the "Democracy Summit" organized by the United States was muted without video, according to a YouTube recording of the summit.
The Reuters news agency, citing sources, claims that the image was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the cause was a map in which Taiwan was highlighted in a different color from the PRC, which considers the island to be its territory.
The map that Mrs. Tan showed was compiled by the South African NGO CIVICUS and ranked countries around the world according to the degree of civil rights protection.
Taiwan was marked green as "free," while the PRC, the DPRK, Laos, and Vietnam were marked red as "closed."
After the minister showed the map, the image from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note stating that the opinions of the discussion participants "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government."
China was not invited to the "Democracy Summit."
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister could contradict the "one China" policy that Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was displayed, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The "Democracy Summit" organized by Washington took place from December 9 to 10, with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Novaya Gazeta editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, Yuri Averyanov, stated that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."
They serve you food as if they are cooking it, and there is rotten meat everywhere, in fact, the butcher keeps the meat until the very last piece.

The New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board performed a suborbital flight
The New Shepard spacecraft of the company Blue Origin, with six tourists on board, performed a suborbital flight on Saturday, December 11.
The journey, which was broadcast on the company's website, lasted a total of more than ten minutes, after which the capsule with the passengers descended to Earth, TASS reports.
The launch of the rocket carrier was conducted from a spaceport in the area of the American city Van Horn (Texas).
The ship rose to a height of slightly more than 100 km, and the space tourists found themselves in a state of weightlessness.
The rocket carrier landed on the launch pad at the spaceport as planned.
On July 20, Blue Origin successfully carried out the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers on board.

But it's none of your business how many and when they have children, until they decide to hang those children around your neck.
And since that is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?

And what about other areas of life, such as the judicial system and so on?

China is strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where there are land border crossing points
The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China has issued a circular requiring enhanced prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where there are land border crossing points, in order to further prevent the importation of the infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result from a nucleic acid COVID-19 test obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those who arrive in cities where land border crossing points are located must take at least one nucleic acid COVID-19 test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the date when the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, up until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities that have land border crossing points and meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the US
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov evaluated the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington in an interview with Izvestia.
He noted that a long history of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but as far as any prospect of improving relations is concerned, it is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion after a long journey that we have gone through, both with the current administration and with Trump and Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is related to the United States' desire to impose approaches on Russia on a wide range of issues.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he would not dare to make optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there is no progress.
Meanwhile, Russia calls on the United States to adopt a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heard, and that the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the US.
A virologist warned of the danger of nasal vaccination against COVID outside of hospitals
People who have been vaccinated with the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may experience allergic reactions and require medical assistance, so it is not advisable to set up the first vaccination points in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS, by the virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the Laboratory of Bionanotechnology, Microbiology, and Virology at Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to set up vaccination points for nasal vaccines at airports and shopping centers, but I would only do this at the outset in medical facilities.
The thing is, there is a risk of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, though it is small, but it would be better if the person sat nearby the doctor's office afterwards.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy medications that work within minutes or two, which can sometimes be very useful," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to consider vaccination in shopping centers when there is experience in using the drug.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a risk that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated sneezes after the injection, due to a blocked nose.

Serbia has produced 2 million doses of the "Sputnik V" vaccine
The vaccine "Sputnik V" is most popular in Serbia.
Serbia has produced around 2 million doses of the Russian vaccine "Sputnik V," TASS quoted the country's Minister of Innovation and Technological Development, Nedim Popović, as saying.
"At the state-run Torlak Institute, approximately 2 million doses of the "Sputnik V" vaccine have been produced to date, and we expect that at least 4 million will be produced in the coming period," Popovic noted.
According to him, the Russian vaccine is the most popular among Serbs.
In light of this, the republic plans to make an additional purchase of one million doses of the vaccine from Russia.
The Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of Serbia also expressed interest in producing the nasal vaccine "Sputnik V" and the "Sputnik Light" drug on the territory of the state.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin reported that Russia has delivered almost two million doses of the domestic coronavirus vaccine "Sputnik V" to Serbia.
The lama is said to believe that the true believers make up the church.
We do not know whether there are any true believers among them or not.
Each of us would like to be as truly devout as that, and everyone tries to be.
But no one should say that they are the only true believers, either about themselves or about those who believe the same as they do.
Because if they can say about themselves that they are true believers, then so can others.

A column formed behind me.
Missed.
Then the belt on the GUR broke.
Then the traffic police stopped us.
The column was organized and they had a car breakdown.
It needs to be towed.
The owner of the MAZ explained that he was drunk and the driver was inexperienced.
And he - how drunk are you?
You don't trip, you don't fall.
With flashing lights, we're off to the races!
As far as I'm concerned, he's always in the ads. Let him worry about it.

In the UK, 1,239 cases of the omicron strain of the coronavirus were recorded in a single day - RT in Russian
In the UK, 1,239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of the coronavirus were detected in the last 24 hours.
Sky News reports on this.
Specifically, 1,196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new variant of the infection in Scotland, and five did so in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with COVID-19 by the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine gave a pessimistic forecast, calculating that in England, by April, 75,000 people could die as a result of the outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the "omicron" strain.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that are introducing anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose restrictions on Russia and not suffer yourself" - the Kremlin spokesman said in a TV broadcast on Channel 1.
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this."
Earlier, it was reported that the United States are considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will make it more difficult to convert rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
Meanwhile, Sberbank CEO German Gref is convinced that this is impossible.
From reasonable thinking people - correspondingly reasonable comments!
Something about these simple to the point of nausea recipes already makes me feel nauseous.

Ksenia, you don't need to explain anything to me, my mind is obligated to figure it out on its own!

The inhabitants of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, an overwhelming majority of participants rejected leaving the French Republic.
On December 12, the French television channel BFM.TV reported about this.
96.5% of those who voted opposed independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the island archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
Voter turnout on that day was very low: about 55% of the archipelago's residents went to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by separatists' calls for people to boycott the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum date.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on the issue of independence was already held in the region.
Most residents supported the archipelago's inclusion in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia to be its possession.
About 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is an agreement from 1998 between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice, with a two-year gap in between.

The WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers that "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines against the new COVID-19 variant.
As of December 9, "omicron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the "omicron" strain protein suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against the infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is believed that it ("the severity of the disease") may be less severe than that of "delta", according to a technical report from the WHO.
The organization notes that so far, all registered cases of infection with the "omicron" variant in the EU have been mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than the "delta".
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They "had previously been vaccinated," the Gamaleya Center reported.
Head of the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights, Anna Popova, stated that there is no reliable data indicating that the new coronavirus variant is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for Zelensky have been named
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may lose the support of the West, and may also be forced to compromise on the Donbas.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko spoke about this in a post on the "Glavred" portal.
The first option that Denisenko called "the perfect storm" assumes that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine, reaching an agreement about the country's future without its participation, and abandoning it.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"At the same time, there is a reduction in prices for key goods that we traditionally export ... internal protests and confrontation with the authorities by key FPGs (financial-industrial groups. - Red.)", the former parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation—"war against everyone."
This forecast will come true if there is high turbulence in world politics, in which case Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the leadership of Ukraine may be willing to compromise on the Donbas, which could lead to internal conflict.
By the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, and the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between groups of the population that are not in agreement with Zelensky and the president, which could lead to the seizure of control over the power block and the implementation of "populist initiatives."
During this type of crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is transforming Zelensky into a "father of the nation."
This can be caused by some event that will become a strong shock to society.
"The event must be significant enough to elicit a response from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a development of events is possible as a result of a natural disaster, technological catastrophe, or aggressive actions by Russia, the former deputy believes.
Meanwhile, the Russian side has already rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine on multiple occasions.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the results of a survey by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the president of Ukraine's rating had fallen to record low levels, reaching 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since he was elected head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% of voters would have cast their ballots for Zelensky, while 14.5% would have voted for former president of the country, Petro Poroshenko.
Meanwhile, only 19.3% of those surveyed expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete. I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had died, it's very sad to hear such news.
I remember cheering for her at the Seoul Olympics, for us residents of Primorsky Krai, it was live, real-time television.
There was such a fervor, the emotions were overwhelming; I remember the joy when Elena won.
They also rejoiced in the other victories, cheering for Salnikov, the football players, and all the Soviet athletes at the time.
I once saw a documentary on television about one of the Central American countries, and there they were rolling watermelons down the gangplank like barrels.
The watermelons were of monstrous size.
I myself worked many times in my youth picking and loading watermelons in Astrakhan Oblast and never encountered watermelons weighing more than a pud.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the vineyard and not before the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, beige color, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, item number: 12008).
A balconette bra with soft lace cups on a frame.
The lower part of the cup is reinforced with a non-elastic transparent fabric.
The side inner part of the cup, in the area of the shoulder strap attachment, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that prevents the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the trim along the neckline and under the bust.
The vertical ridges on the side panels made of single-layer microfiber prevent the fabric from wrinkling on larger sizes.
I didn't like the article at all, it was mean and poisonous.
We went around talking to people you know nothing about.
But now, many people like to break things down to their atoms.
I hope that the commentators are honorable and knowledgeable in all things, and that they conduct themselves with dignity and propriety.

The poet arrested for an action on Red Square: "For quoting Evtushenko, you get 10 days, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from HSE was detained on Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #poetrossiibolshechempoet was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Evgeny Evtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander for an administrative offense of repeated violation of the rules for conducting a public demonstration.
The first time he was arrested was on January 23 on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, and unfortunately, interest in it has now been lost. There is also a decline in the general culture in Russia, and there is a small hope that this hashtag will inspire unknown poets to write their poems online," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and to delve deeper into the message of his letter.
How did the police officers treat you during the arrest this time and previously?
What did they ask at the department, and how did they comment on your action?
This time the officers were more polite, the detention was as brief as possible, and they were as courteous as possible, although it may sound funny in some contexts of this word.
At Pushkinskaya, the OMON officers were tough and took people hard.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When we heard it, in principle, we looked at it with either approval or understanding.
Except for the monkey cage, which was ventilated on all four sides, everything was extremely proper, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if, after the action under this hashtag, even just a few people start writing their own poems, I will not have wasted those 10 days in jail.
Maxim, according to protocol, you can speak privately in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, one speaks the language of the surrounding people in order for everyone to understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in one's native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks excellent Russian and yet she still uses an interpreter.
And at official events, the minutes are still taken by hand with a fountain pen, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.

Researchers told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals that promote improved blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains vitamins of the B group, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the body's systems function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high content of kelp, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and regular consumption can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for maximum benefit, the root vegetable is better to stew or boil rather than fry in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other high-glycemic foods.
These are products with a high content of carbohydrates that are quickly broken down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper Kommersant warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the decline in their production in private subsidiary farms and the increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the current shortage of products can only be replaced by imports at the moment.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex's search results
Candidates for elimination
In 2015, the copyright holders from the cluster "RAEC/Media" compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites in Runet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, the director general of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - have managed to survive thanks in part to regular changes of domain names, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in search results for both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series Squid Game and Tenderness, directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia, ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated new release "Encanto," but judging by the video quality, it's a so-called screencap (a pirated copy of the film filmed in a theater).
Filmix, which can also be found via search engines, offers the TV series "Univer. 10 Years Later" from the TNT channel (part of Gazprom Media).

Two were just right.
Dimax Micro Ultimate Mattress, Size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two different surfaces with different levels of firmness—high firmness and slightly above average.
The product contains only high-quality and premium fillings, which have proven themselves to be nothing but the best.
Springs: the model has a block of independent springs called "micro-pack" in the center.
This means that there are 2,000 coils per sleeping area, which work completely autonomously.
It is their operation that provides the unique point-by-point adjustment.
"Micro-pack" is the highest frequency of the entire range of Dimax spring blocks, so it has a very pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: On top and bottom of the springs are combinations of layers of coir and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut coir.
Such a combination of fillings has long since become a classic, as it not only imparts orthopedic properties to the mattress, but also anatomical ones.
If koira provides proper back support, latex adapts the surface to the body of a person.
Cover: the model is supplied in a Aloe Vera terry cloth cover.
At the customer's request, it can be made either removable or fixed in place.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping surface is 170 kg.
Guarantee and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full safety and reliability in use.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions launching in five years' time is to assess the habitability of Venus' clouds, and then to search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools for measuring the acidity and oxygen content of Venus' clouds.
Until now, it was thought that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, were too acidic to support life, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to life on Earth or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that life on Earth did not begin on Earth.
If it differs, then it may be more likely that life originated on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Mihkel Pajusalu.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of metaverses became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as an extension of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, since people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a result of businesses' desire to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
With the third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitizing assets, when any rights, securities, works of art, and even money are transferred to a digital format.
Anja, you are right, changing one's diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating properly, you no longer want something too fatty and unhealthy.
Of course, we will have the traditional salad Olivier and herring under a fur coat at the party, but no one is forcing me to eat everything at once.
You can eat a spoonful, try it - and that's enough.
After all, there are really ten days of holidays ahead, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes you like.

British economist was unable to make a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to make a forecast for 2022, as he believes such attempts would end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability, and any trend can change the market.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and inflation comes in second, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he doesn't know whether the price increase on goods is temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of unlimited central bank generosity had run its course" and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates, adjusted for inflation, will correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that in the context of the pandemic, continuing with ultra-soft economic policies may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, it is worth paying attention to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the rise in poverty levels and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, the head of the global research department at Opening Investments, Mikhail Shulgin, reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 remain intact, although the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar exchange rate, Shulgin named the monetary and credit policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices, and concerns amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
I have to agree.
But there is one thing that is encouraging: if we compare ourselves to ourselves, there were fewer containers five years ago.
It's better now.
Progress is there, but it's sluggish.
Another problem is that there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.

Russians have given car dealerships around 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to Russian Automotive Market Research (RAMR) statistical data, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars in the first 10 months of 2021, which is 28% more than for the same period last year.
To understand the scale, roughly the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
At the September meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenue on the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is the leader.
In the first 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the year before.
The related Kia brand Hyundai has an even greater increase of more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is also leading in terms of growth in the average selling price of a car, which increased by almost 21% over the course of a year to 1.94 million rubles. Only Changan, Chery, Geely, and Mercedes-Benz showed stronger price growth.
Meanwhile, the sales volumes of Korean brands grew only moderately: according to statistics from the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in quantitative terms over the same period than it did the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota rounds out the top three in terms of sales volume in monetary terms. Russians spent 27.55 billion rubles on cars of this brand over the past 10 months, which is 14% more than the year before.
Next come the Japanese with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand also saw an increase in both sales volume (by 37%) and the average price of a car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz simultaneously experiences a good increase in sales and an average price increase - more, for example, than BMW - which is why there is also a greater increase in financial capacity, - explained NAPI CEO Tatiana Arabadjie. -
The Chinese brands are showing fantastic growth rates, also significantly increasing their financial capacity this year."
The Russian Lada brand demonstrates average market dynamics in terms of revenue growth (+28%), with Russians spending 229.4 billion rubles on vehicles of this brand over the past 10 months.
Companies that sold fewer cars in units in 2021 than in the previous year are at the same level as last year in terms of financial capacity: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Nissan.
UAZ is even in the red: over the past 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand, compared to 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Amid problems with component supply and production disruptions affecting the entire automotive industry, automakers continue to constantly adjust prices—the same "AvtoVAZ" has raised the price of Lada models seven times in a year, with the last increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurring at the end of November.
Other automakers regularly revise their price tags on their products.
The Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to grow further - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation and the desire of automakers to make up for past losses are also contributing factors, experts say.
In the context of a shortage of cars, I think that many automotive companies were even able to partially pass on to consumers the costs of previous periods that they were unable to include in the price of cars previously.
says Vladimir Bespalov, an automotive analyst at VTB Capital. -
I believe that financially, automakers are feeling very good right now, maintaining high margins on sales."
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of car prices observed in 2021, which are growing faster than inflation, the expert notes.
In the long term, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and value, but mostly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With the increase in supply, the possibilities for raising prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian automotive market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the price of cars slows down, as automakers will be able to make their profits based on volume, notes independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now trying to maximize profits from each car sold, notes Burgazliev. -
An increase in the volume of machine production is not expected at least in the next half-year, while in Russia, the frenzy is further fueled by the citizens' uncertainty about the future.
In light of the situation on the market, cars have turned out to be a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its initial price, the expert notes.
Biden spoke about the deployment of US troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a "Russian invasion."
US President Joe Biden made such a statement.
"There were never such plans," said the White House chief, responding to a reporter's question about whether the US had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he emphasized that the United States and NATO do not have an obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of the unilateral use of American troops for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukrainian territory, the US will deploy forces to eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Estonia).
"We will have to deploy more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to defend them from any attack by Russia" - said Biden.
Earlier, the press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intention of invading Ukrainian territory.
At the same time, he noted that Moscow sees the problem in the use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev for military purposes, as well as the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."

If a scammer calls from a number like this, pretending to be a "police officer" or a member of another law enforcement agency, it's not effective to just hang up, and it's likely you won't have time to add the number to the blacklist.
Because to confirm his lie about being connected to the security services, he quickly repeats the call and continues to intimidate and persuade.
The people need more useful recommendations.

The felting wool set "Assort No. 2" is 100% merino wool, 4x10 g.

I don't voice my thoughts, I mentally curse all of you.
I mentally chop off the heads of everyone who didn't give me their seat, mentally send them off the road and burn all the cars that are blocking my way, mentally everything!
And I can even smile at you on the surface.
But I remember that thought is material!
Peter, during the years of his reign, never signed a death sentence. Neither did Nicholas II.
Even such daredevils as Koba and his team.
And Bloody Sunday is already a fabrication of the Bolsheviks.

A film by Alexander Sokurov's student won the European "Oscar" for best editing
The Russian film nominated for an Oscar, "Clutching Fists," received the award from the European Film Academy (also known as the "European Oscar") in the "Best Editing" category, reports Moscow Komsomolskaya Pravda.
The contest jury, which voted online due to the complex epidemiological situation, praised the filmmakers' outstanding craftsmanship.
The film by Jasmin Džbanić (Bosnia) "Where Are You Going, Aida?" received the maximum number of awards this time.
The film's main character is a translator for the UN mission who tries to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Clenching Fists," directed by Kira Kovalenko (graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), this film tells the story of the complex relationship between a domineering father and his children who are growing up and wanting to break free from paternal oversight in North Ossetia.
Earlier, it was announced that this film was nominated for an Oscar award as the best film made in a foreign language.
As regular friendly meetings between the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, I think you are, to put it mildly, out of the loop.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian KAMAZ plant.
