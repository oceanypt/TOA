Crying out to the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland has gotten off to a good start, and the cries and calls out in nature are starting to attract people from all over the world.
"You own the joke, I need Iceland," says a woman somewhere out in the big wide world in a comment on the Looks Like You Need Iceland ad campaign on the video-sharing site YouTube.
Another viewer says he will always keep Iceland in his heart forever and a young woman says she will have to go to Iceland as soon as possible, as her boyfriend lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States, and is therefore expecting to have to wait for several more months.
Another spectator asks whether the route to Iceland is passable, since there are no planes.
It is not clear from the story whether he comes from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson from the advertising agency Peel, who worked on the ads along with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the response has been far beyond expectations.
I have been involved in many Inspired by Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already breaking records.
At its core, this is about creating PR value, that is, getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in approximately seven hundred media outlets around the world, which collectively reach over two billion people.
The value of that coverage is estimated at 1.8 billion ISK.
It's not bad at all."
The main market is usually the United States, and the campaign has gone very well there, even though Americans are not expected to visit the country anytime soon.
According to Egill, well-known markets such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also done well, as have Russia, which comes as a pleasant surprise.
Then there were responses from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically sought out.
"These ads have traveled further than we expected," says Egill, and it is worth noting that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We couldn't have asked for a better start."
The photos here at the opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, a photographer for Morgunblaðið, during the filming of advertisements with the title "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
Filming took place all over the place, such as on Skólavörðustíg in Reykjavík, at Reynisfjara, at Skógarfoss, on Sólheimajökull, and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
Directors were Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions, and cinematographer Óttar Guðnason.
In the roles in the aforementioned film, the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary, were cast.
Dozens of Icelanders were involved in the making of the ads, while at the same time another group was filming in the south of the country while another group was in the Westfjords and on the West Coast.
According to Egill, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, with a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi planned.
"This is just the first phase of the work for Icelandic Tourist Board," says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone extremely well.
It's great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to.
Sprengisandur: Discussing the state of the labour market, pensions and much more
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social and Children's Affairs, will appear on Sprengisand, which starts at 10:00 on Bylgjan today.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the situation on the labour market as such, the Icelandair case, and other matters.
He also discusses rural issues and the relocation of jobs to the countryside, which has gone badly and been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, also appears in the show and he will discuss his criticism of pension fund investments, proposing that the labor movement and employers withdraw from the boards of the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then, Ivar Ingimarsson, a tourism manager in East Iceland, and Árný Jóhannsdóttir, the managing director of Markaðsstofa Norðurlands, will discuss the situation in tourism in the countryside.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder whether the success of the summer is a misleading omen of what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, which starts at 10 o'clock.
This is how it looks today, 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teenage-oriented shows of all kinds.
However, she achieved worldwide fame for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also appeared in the series Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
She has been rather scarce lately, but she did agree to look back on her past and talk about Clueless on Australian television recently.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, and says she was a wonderful person.
I have to admit that I built the character mostly on girls I met in school who were not nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," said Donovan about his performance in Clueless.
Did not want to leave the police station after an overnight stay
Around fifty cases came to the attention of the police in the capital area today, and the police's daily log states that the cases were varied.
The day at the Hverfisgata police station began with the police having to intervene with a man who had recently been released from a cell after being detained for drunk driving.
Did the man not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the police instructions to leave?
The man earned himself further stay at the police station due to his conduct.
Then, in the early morning, a man was arrested on suspicion of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to intervene in two men in Breiðholt due to a report of a physical assault.
Also, a woman who was having a meal in a shopping center in Kópavog was unable to pay for the bill after the meal and was therefore called to the police.
There was also a report of a car theft in the city center this morning.
The driver of a white Renault delivery van briefly lost sight of her and she was then taken by force.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Glee Squad - Terrible Fates of the Gleestars
The theory that a curse hangs over the Glee series has gained traction on the Internet, as actress Naya Rivera recently drowned in California, becoming the third main cast member of the show to die prematurely.
The Glee series is a popular TV show about singing, dancing, and joy.
The series dealt with a so-called high school marching band, their loves and their fates.
It was not always easy to be in the cheerleading squad, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the show seemed to overcome any difficulties that arose in their lives.
However, outside of the filming location, great tragedies have befallen the actors and crew of the show, to such an extent that theories have arisen about a curse on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the series, a cheerleader who was not all that she seemed.
After the series had run its course, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had her first and only child, Josey, with him.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they subsequently separated.
Dorsey, however, refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8 last year, it was announced that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on a boat drifting in Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and he was able to tell the police authorities that he and his mother had gone swimming and that Rivera had brought him back on board but never returned himself.
A major search operation was launched for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the regional police chief reported that, during the search, it was assumed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.
It is believed that she encountered a strong current in the water and used her last breath to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded as being due to drowning as a result of an accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing Glee to prominence.
Outside of the show, Moneith also struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and it was difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his co-stars on the show intervened and encouraged him to seek help, feeling that enough was enough.
Moneith then went into treatment and it seemed that things were looking up.
Only two months after completing his treatment, Moneith was found dead in his hotel room after going out to party with friends.
The cause of death turned out to be a deadly cocktail of drugs and alcohol.
It was not considered to be a case of foul play.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for drugs had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well proved to be fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was a heavy blow to his co-stars, but at the urging of his on-screen partner Lea Michele, it was decided to continue filming the show and dedicate an entire episode to Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his Glee classmates, until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles, suspected of possessing child pornography.
During a search of his home, a massive amount of child pornography was found and the matter quickly became public knowledge.
It was clear that Salling was done.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his crimes.
He faced four to seven years in prison, as well as having to register as a sex offender and seek treatment for pedophilia.
Before the judge determined the sentence, Salling, who was then released on bail, was found near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors of the show who passed away far before their time.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the series.
He died suddenly in his sleep in 2013, at the age of 41.
Also working on the show was a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the star Julia Roberts and did not tell her a pretty story, accusing Roberts of being very domineering and disrespectful.
Motes took her own life in 2014, struggling with severe depression.
She left a letter for her lover in which she blamed her mother and sisters, among others, for how she had been treated.
"My mother and so-called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and abusing her co-stars on set and having an overbearing celebrity attitude.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which caused a great scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
In 2010, she was the victim of unscrupulous computer hackers who obtained nude photos of her and posted them on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both appeared in the show and were in a relationship outside of it.
Later, Benoist revealed that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything
It promotes child development when children are allowed to play in the garden with their parents, growing flowers and watching them grow and thrive.
There are also endless possibilities with flowers, as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just spending time with the kids in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and of course the precious time they spent with their parents.
Bought a boat after tenth grade
"I think we are not many fishermen working in kindergartens across the country," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who engages in coastal fishing in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.
Coastal fishing is a very convenient summer job when one is in school.
If fishing is good, it is possible to make good money and I think it's great to be able to avoid taking student loans.
The income also helps me get through the winter, too," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student who engages in coastal fishing in the summer, as he has done in previous summers.
Axel was just docking in Tálknafjörð when the reporter caught up with him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.
The winter I was in tenth grade I got my captain's license for boats under twelve meters long, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished elementary school.
I have fished from my boat on the coast every summer since then.
I bought the boat used from a friend of mine, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named it after him.
Hartmann was already an adult when I bought the boat and had stopped going to sea, and he was very happy to see that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer but the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished fishing.
By the end of my first summer on the boat, I owned it debt-free."
But how could a boy have a half a million to pay out in a boat when he had just finished primary school?
I had saved up and put money aside, I had worked with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I fished with him every summer and got my share.
I also put my confirmation money into my boat fund.
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all his maternal family is from, but he has lived in Kópavog since he was a boy.
I can fish in the west area because I have a permanent residence with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I learned about these areas here in the west from rowing with my dad.
I move between fjords depending on how I feel, as this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Although I prefer to be on the west side, I have also fished around Snæfellsnes and elsewhere.
I have also fished down south, but mostly for herring, says Axel, who always goes out alone very early in the morning and sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, spending hours alone on the Baltic Sea.
The internet connection at sea is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't mind being on my own boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into trouble, but there have certainly been times when the weather has been bad, but never any real danger,'' says Axel, who is fortunate that he never gets seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the fishing goes each time.
"In the coastal fishing, I am never more than 14 hours at sea fishing at a time, but I have also fished in other systems, such as the lease quota, and then I have been out at sea continuously for one and a half days fishing."
The arrangement for coastal fishing, he says, is such that he can catch 770 kilos per day, which he finds restrictive.
Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to fish on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I am only allowed to fish for twelve days a month, during the four months that the coastal fishing season is in effect, which are May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days based on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to settle down instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to choose as they please.
The regional division could also be improved in my view, and fishing ports that are well located near fishing grounds should be allowed to benefit from this, says Axel, who mainly catches cod from the sea on his coastal fishing trips, but also some ufsi and other occasional species as well.
Axel works during the winter season with his university studies at the Núpur preschool in Kópavog.
"I think we are not many sailors who work in the country's kindergartens," Axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
I got stuck there because I think it's a great job.
I hope that my psychology studies will be useful to me in the future on the preschool level,'' says Axel, who is also well advanced in his studies of business administration.
A registration error prevented homecoming quarantine measures
An error in the form that people fill out when they arrive in the country resulted in a person resident in the country not being called back for a retest.
It is not a requirement to enter a tax ID number if the individual fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is filled out in Icelandic.
"This will be investigated this week," says an expert in infectious diseases at the Chief Medical Officer.
Three domestic infections were detected at the virology department of Landspítalinn yesterday.
One of them that turned out to be positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the so-called homecoming quarantine rules came into effect.
Those who are resident in Iceland are then screened upon arrival in the country and then called back for testing four to five days later.
In the midday news on RÚV, it was reported that the individual had, however, followed the old system.
The border screening was negative and he was not called back for testing for the virus.
Camilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of public health at the Chief Medical Officer, says in an interview with the newsroom that this can be traced to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English, they do not have to enter a personal identification number as is required in the Icelandic version.
After all, it was primarily intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the individual did not receive an automatic invitation to come in for a test.
Kamilla says that many people, however, have followed the rules for homecoming infection routes even though they filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people for testing again after they arrived in the country.
"This week we will look at how we can make it easier for people to access this and draw their attention to the process."
The man is in isolation and six have been put in quarantine.
They all underwent testing, but two were already showing symptoms.
Contact tracing is now underway for the three cases identified yesterday, but it is mostly complete for the two cases reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequencing by Íslensk erfðagreining has revealed that they are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the focus has been on Israel, even though it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should become clear tomorrow where the other virus is coming from.
There are now 15 in isolation according to the website COVID.is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five cases unrelated
Five domestic cases have been detected here in recent days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and, for example, the source of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday has not yet been identified.
Contact tracing is still ongoing.
Originally, there were over a dozen individuals who were particularly isolated in quarantine, but this was reduced to sixteen.
In total, 34 are in quarantine due to these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that a case has been detected at a sporting event, raising questions about whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communication officer at the Civil Protection Department of the National Police Commissioner, says it is very easy, as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
We are constantly reminding everyone who lives here that they need to maintain individual protective measures.
We also need to remind people who are organizing events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
Then you can hold events," says Jóhann.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by maintaining individual-specific infection prevention measures.
In addition, rules and standards are constantly being reviewed.
"What needs to be done, and what the Civil Protection Department and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer are constantly reminding people of, is to pay attention to these individual protective measures.
Both at home and also at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use hand sanitizer.
It prevents the spread of infection," says Jóhann.
We need to remind people that we need to continue on the good path we were on, in order to maintain the success we have achieved so far.
40% of COVID-19 victims had type 2 diabetes
Devon Brumfield heard through the phone how hard her father was having to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was let go.
The death was attributed to sudden respiratory difficulties due to a coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as an underlying condition, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same fate awaits her.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
Figures from a new study commissioned by US authorities show that almost 40% of those who died had type 2 diabetes as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not yet reached the age of 65 is considered, the percentage rises to half.
The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study covered more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease expert at the CDC, says the results are striking, especially for those who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
Hidden in the slow growth reported by Reuters, a survey was conducted and the answers from the 12 countries that responded indicated similar percentages.
Ten states, including California, Arizona, and Columbia, are not yet reporting underlying diseases.
Diabetes was already an epidemic in slow motion.
Now, COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful tsunami,'' Reuters quotes Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago, as saying.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also fared worse with the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease in check with exercise, a healthy diet, and the help of healthcare professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
Then, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue going to work and thus risk exposure to the virus.
Reuters points out that U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risk that people with type 2 diabetes could face from the virus.
During the SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2003, about 20% of them had the disease, and during the swine flu pandemic in 2009, this group was three times more likely to require hospitalization.
When MERS made itself known in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus may last longer, the pandemic has revealed a number of previously unknown side effects.
"I fear we will see a wave of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, Chairman of the International Diabetes Federation.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic may indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney failure.
Similarly, new research suggests that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in cases of diabetes.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the links between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weakened in many people with diabetes.
Then, a high level of glucose and lipids in diabetics can cause a true "cytokine storm," as it is called when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to the formation of inflammation, which in turn can cause life-threatening blood clots.
"This is all one big jigsaw puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"It's all interconnected."

"We were offered champagne, so they left the room"
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason accepted the unusual proposition from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was setting up in Paris.
"We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason never forgets the moment he met his wife and stepdaughter, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
I was very attracted to her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but I also thought it was incredibly cute.
And still does," he says.
Ásrún also remembers this, as her husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
"I am always hearing this story.
Just last weekend," she says, also attracted to her husband at first sight.
I felt and still feel so much excitement around Atli, which I dig.
There's a lot going on and a lot happening and I was drawn to that."
Atli says that the couple emphasized the importance of going their own way in their relationship.
We do not bind our baggage with the same knots as our fellow travelers.
We avoid routines that we recognize around us."
It is perhaps for this reason that they welcomed the presentation from Ragnar Kjartansson, the artist, with open arms, even though it was quite unusual to say the least.
Kristín Anna, our mutual friend, contacts us and asks if we can join her for dessert at Snaps with Ragga and Ingibjörg, Ragnar's wife.
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snap's, and had dessert wine and their respective desserts.
They listened to Ragnar as he led them through his plans for an art exhibition he intended to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
He had a multi-part video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Ásrún says he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the daily life of Westerners.
He had sketches of all the scenes he wanted to shoot and last he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating.
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was supposed to show a young middle-class couple falling in love in a minimalist room.
"This is sex with a beginning and an end," says Atli.
The couple didn't know Ragnar very well, although they knew of him and he of them, "but they knew us and thought we fit the bill.
They mentioned that they did not want to advertise for people.
Perhaps they thought they wouldn't get the right people but people who got sexual gratification from performing for others."
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
When we walked out of Snap, we said: Aren't we just up for this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and all his team," says Ásrún and Atli agrees.
"This is about love and closeness"
The scene was filmed in a nice apartment on Mýrargata.
There was a very small film crew there; the cameraman, Ragnar, the sound engineer, and the couple.
After the recording was started, everyone left the room to wait in the car outside except Atli and Ásrún.
We hadn't decided anything about how we were going to be.
We got some minor instructions but we tried to forget time and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no playing involved, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," Ásrún says.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agrees.
We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the pair in the piece, which moved them.
"When Tommi the cameraman watched this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
"This is just as much about love and intimacy as it is about the actual act of intercourse," says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in his son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts thinking about it," says Atli.
Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this, but then my dad just sent me a message and said: It was fun to run into the little family at Palais de Tokyo, Ásrún recalls.
And did participation in the project deepen the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
At least we're still together, so maybe it deepened something.
At least, it deepened my relationship with my in-laws," says Ásrún and laughs.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"I found it a bit difficult to not be with you, but with someone else," she says, turning to her husband.
But it was fun to see this because it's just one scene in a much larger work, and when you see it with the other works it's very impressive.
I was able to distance myself a little from this and was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my belly," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the scene was filmed.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrún and Atli on Ástarsögur on Rás 1.
Swansea win first semi-final match
Swansea won a 1–0 victory over Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first match between the teams in the semi-finals of the playoff to get promoted to the English Premier League.
The game was played at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The score at half-time was 0–0.
The home team in Swansea received a penalty on the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew missed the spot kick and let the goalkeeper save it.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, a player for Brentford, received a red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game a man down, and Swansea players took advantage of the team disadvantage on the 82nd minute.
Andre Ayew made up for the penalty miss by scoring a great goal and securing Swansea a 1–0 victory.
Swansea leads the series 1–0, and the second match will take place at Brentford's home ground next Wednesday.
Without an ambassador for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the American ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard because he feared for his life.
However, it has not been a smooth process for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the post of U.S. Ambassador in late April 2009, the country has been without an ambassador for a total of 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst left office under unusual circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Order of the Falcon.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office informing her that she would not be awarded the title.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed before Van Voorst's successor took office, in September 2010.
To some extent, it can be attributed to the fact that Robert S. Connan was appointed as an ambassador but then withdrew.
Finally, Louis Ariega took over the job, having worked in the foreign service for a decade.
He then retired in the fall of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then came another period without an ambassador, this time lasting for two years.
Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and took office shortly thereafter, but at that time there had been no ambassador on the ground for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not a diplomat, rather he had worked as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's election campaign.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as is customary for politically appointed ambassadors.
Trump's administration was unusually long in appointing both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in the Washington administration.
It took two years for the US Congress to call Jeffrey Ross Gunter to its meeting to question him thoroughly and confirm him as ambassador to Iceland after that.
In his testimony to the court, he said that he had never been to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, while his late wife was of Dutch descent.
Gunter is politically appointed, was previously a dermatologist in California, and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition, a group of Jewish Republicans.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the group, and Adelson is a fervent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter arrived in Iceland in May 2019, at which point there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest period of time without an ambassador that has been seen in Iceland.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration has taken to nominate people to key positions, as well as the fact that the work of the US Congress has dragged on considerably in recent years, including confirming ambassadors to their posts.
Thus, since 2009, Iceland has been without an ambassador for a total of over five years.
However, this has not prevented the embassy from carrying out construction projects, which recently opened its new headquarters at Engjateig.
The construction is estimated to have cost around 6.5 billion, and thick security walls surround the building, while bulletproof glass is in all the windows.
However, it seems not to have been enough to give the current ambassador a sense of security, as he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former IBV player experienced racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former player for ÍBV, says he experienced racism while in Iceland and regrets coming to the country.
This is revealed in an interview with Tonny, which appeared in the Ugandan media outlet Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team, which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Iceland where he played for ÍBV, Val, and Þróttur.
When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle like I was used to.
The team captain was in that position but also had the jersey number I wanted, so I didn't get either of them,'' says Tonny, who played on the right wing for ÍBV this season.
Among the things Tonny discusses is the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when playing in Europe.
This happened to me once, but since I didn't understand the language I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I learned more about the case and then I asked my friend what the case was about.
He told me then that my opponent had made racist remarks about me after I tackled him."
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland to join Haugesund in Norway.
There he says he made the mistakes he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to get into the starting lineup at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, and then joined Val.
It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan again.
I think if I had stayed in Norway for longer, I would have got the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, who hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He wants to believe that the loan to Iceland has put an end to his dreams of playing for a big European team.
Found a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black worm in the throat of a woman who sought treatment there.
The doctors managed to pull the worm out with a tongs.
The investigation revealed that it was a parasite.
CNN reports this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman improved quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites such as this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi became popular in Western countries, cases where parasites have infected people have increased, according to CNN.
Fearing a new wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now in the spotlight in relation to concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where the government has taken action to curb the spread of the coronavirus epidemic again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action in response to the increase in infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone must go into quarantine upon returning from Spain, just as in Norway, and the French have been warned against traveling to Spain.
Infections are also on the rise again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance between containing the spread of the virus and getting the economy back on track.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to other parts of the world, but the number of new infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 per day, with the highest number of cases in the Americas and South Asia.
Confirmed cases worldwide are now 16 million, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, and deaths confirmed to be related to the virus are now 644,000.
Gerður's mosaic artwork finally gets its due
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
There are men with orange helmets inside it.
There is also a big pit there.
And smaller construction machinery.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the pavement is accessible and many now linger there to admire the artwork made of millions of mosaic tiles, as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen anything like it before.
At least, they didn't seem to care.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, right in front of it there were always parking spaces that were always occupied.
People parked there, locked their cars in a hurry, and then dashed off to attend to their business in the city center.
"Lively and diverse public spaces" and "attractive urban character" are the guiding principles of the ongoing revitalization of Tryggvagata.
The aim is to improve the area and allow Gerður Helgadóttir's mosaic work at the Customs House to be seen better.
In front of the work will be a square, and since the area is well exposed to the sun, it is considered suitable as a resting area for travelers.
The artwork will be illuminated and the materials will now be better showcased on this 142 square meter site than before.
There will also be small "fog blowers," a sort of water sculpture, which provide play and add a certain mystique to the area.
The redevelopment is described in this way by Reykjavíkurborg, which is carrying out the project in cooperation with Veitur.
Water, heating, and electricity distribution pipes will be renewed.
Many of them are past their prime, but the sewer and cold water lines were built in 1925 and have thus served the residents and businesses of the downtown area for nearly a century.
When the road reopens after the work is completed, cars can drive on it again.
However, it will be a one-way street, and at the same time, it will create calmer and more accessible spaces for pedestrians.
On the Customs House website, information about the building states that it was put into use in 1971, and the architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because the warehouse penetrated through the house, there was a 250 square meter windowless wall facing the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such a flat surface would have a negative impact on the overall street view if no special measures were taken to enhance the appearance of the building.
The parties therefore agreed to assume that a permanent work of art would be installed there.
During this time, a lot was said about Gerði Helgadóttir, the artist, says the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic artworks in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether to hold a competition for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work should reflect life at the harbor, since the harbor had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was built.
When the artist was asked about the work, she became visibly moved by it.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country again, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður took the time she decided she needed herself, and when she returned home she presented a few proposals for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the work.
In addition, it was requested that a comprehensive contract be made with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Oidtmann brothers, as Gerður had worked with them for a long time to install famous works of art throughout Europe.
An agreement was reached and Gerður created the work under the supervision of the brothers' workshop, which then oversaw the installation of the Customs House.
The entire project was handled exceptionally well, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, according to the summary.
It has stood up to the harsh Icelandic weather ever since.
It took Gerði about two years to complete the work, which was done and installed in the years 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Customs House was completed, at the age of only 47.
Prepares the transfer of more institutions to the countryside
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, the Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be moved out to the countryside in the near future.
The minister said this in the Sprengisand program on Bylgjan radio at noon.
Recently, it was announced that the fire protection division of the Housing and Construction Agency will be moved to Sauðárkrókur in the north in the fall.
Six fire safety experts work for the institution, but none of them intend to follow the institution northwards, and the National Association of Firefighters and Rescue Workers has criticized the relocation.
I think we should take further steps in this matter.
I am preparing further steps in this matter.
Further movements," said Ásmundur.
He claims to be convinced that a large majority of the population wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
"I think more political decisions need to be made about moving public services out to the regions, as I am doing with the Housing and Construction Authority, for example," said Ásmundur, who also gave the example of other institutions that have been moved out to the regions and have had a major impact on the communities there, such as the move of the Food and Veterinary Authority to Selfoss, the Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes, and the unemployment insurance office to Skagaströnd.
All the latest from the second day of the Masters
The Icelandic Championships in Athletics concluded today at Þórsvöllur in Akureyri.
Several records were set on the second competition day.
Exciting competition was expected in the women's javelin throw at Þórsvöllur, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Icelandic record in the javelin throw in 2014, which stood until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR broke the record in May last year.
Vigdís regained the Icelandic record earlier this summer and has been in great form lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic record so far this summer.
Elísabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and did not find her rhythm today.
She only had one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the farthest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt, setting a new meet record.
Her Icelandic record, which she set earlier in July, was 62.69 meters, so she was quite a way off that.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day, improving her personal best with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic record holder in the javelin throw, won a comfortable victory, throwing 73.84 meters in his next-to-last throw, setting a new meet record.
His Icelandic record in the event is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympic athlete and Icelandic record holder in discus throwing, won the shot put competition at Þórsvöllur yesterday, but today he competed in discus throwing, his main event.
Guðni Valur's Icelandic record is 65.53 meters, but he threw the farthest today at 59.13 meters and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second-longest throw today, with one valid throw that earned him second place at 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the national record holder in the long jump, won the long jump competition with ease, but Hafdís jumped 6.25 meters today, which is just under 40 cm from her own Icelandic record.
In the women's 200-meter race, it was ÍR's Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, finishing in 24.04 seconds, but her national record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was successful in Akureyri, winning two gold medals yesterday, in the 100-meter sprint and in the 4 x 100-meter relay, and also today in the 4 x 400-meter relay.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was first to cross the finish line in the 200-meter race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Máni Samúelsson from Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meters.
Not fined for 27 million króna Bitcoin harvest
The Tax Appeal Board has rejected a claim by a tax inspector who demanded a fine against a person for underreporting his capital gains, which were derived from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator did not provide clear reasons as to why it was necessary to fine the man.
In the ruling of the committee, it is stated that the tax investigator considered the man to have filed materially incorrect tax returns for the years 2016 and 2017.
He had underreported his capital gains, which were due to the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, amounting to 27 million, either deliberately or due to gross negligence.
The man should be punished for his behavior.
The man rejected this in a letter to the committee.
He did, however, admit to having sold cryptocurrency for 27 million in 2016.
He would have acquired it through excavation in the years 2009 and 2010, when it would have been both easy and inexpensive with a regular home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrencies, the tax implications of such a sale were very unclear and unpredictable.
It would have been almost impossible to expect that ordinary citizens would understand such arrangements on their tax returns.
He would not have expected to avoid paying tax on the harvest and would have declared his ownership of the crop as a deposit on a foreign currency account on his tax return.
He had inquired with both experts and the tax authorities about how this was handled, but without success.
He then considered that it was necessary to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to understand complex rules that tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion on.
The man considered it right that his taxes for those two income years would be reassessed and penalties applied, but otherwise no punishment would be imposed.
He then reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes here since 2012.
He would never have intended to evade his duties in an unlawful manner.
The demand for a fine would be excessive and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur causes a stir: "This man knows what football is all about"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been quite divisive among people, but has also earned praise for his performance so far this season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max league.
Breiðablik will be in the spotlight tonight when they take on ÍA in a live broadcast on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is then suspended from play due to four yellow cards during the season and therefore does not appear with a new haircut as in the games so far this summer.
He had "blah, blah, blah" written on the back of his head before the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
I don't know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but speaking about character, he was certainly trying hard in the game.
He didn't hide it.
He wants the ball every time and if there was anyone who was going to equalize this game, I thought he would do it or create it, said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stand when the conversation turned to Brynjólfur.
"I am here for the people."
It can be difficult sometimes to figure out where he is at.
He drifts a bit to the left as the games go on, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólfur is a real entertainer and welcomes the fact that such a colourful person is joining the team: "There is no doubt that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love the hair, and always being ready to meet and answer interviews.
There is an incredible amount of people who are obsessed with him, which tells me that this man knows a lot about football.
"I am an entertainer.
I am here for the people and to enjoy it."
People are reading the interviews with Brynjólfur, people are paying to get in and watching to see what's next on his hair.
This guy is just a genius," said Máni.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with a few teams in the second division"
Tobias Thomsen, a Pepsi Max-league player for KR, seems to be on his way out of the team.
According to the Danish media outlet Bold, Tobias is ready to go back home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the matter.
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country, but first he needs to terminate his contract with KR, as the Danish league starts before the Icelandic one ends.
The club knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
I have been in contact with a few teams in the B-league and will probably switch before the end of the Icelandic season.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay off my contract with KR."
He then says that he will probably have to accept a pay cut in Denmark.
"Companies in Denmark have probably felt more economic effects from the virus than in Iceland."
Bicycle whisperer Bjartmar has recovered bikes worth millions - Now answering for himself after DV coverage
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had an interest that is unlike most others.
He sniffs out and recovers lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles, and scooters.
As a result, Bjartmar has earned the nickname "the bicycle whisperer."
Yesterday, there was quite a stir when a man published an account of his interactions with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to discussions on the Facebook group of Westurbæingar, where it was stated that Bjartmar had spoken to the man on Austurvöllur and suggested that the scooter might have been stolen.
Was it not possible to read anything else from the original writings of the scooter driver other than that Bjartmar had stolen from him?
The text has now been changed on Facebook, and the headline of the original DV article has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news reports about the incident were not at all representative of what actually happened yesterday at Austurvöllur.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victim of the scooter theft that this was indeed his scooter.
The information the alleged owner received came from another person, but the information turned out to be false, says Bjartmar.
I saw the goat and I recognized the scooter, as I had information that this was a scooter that had been missing for a very long time and that a search had been underway for it.
I hesitated for sure, but when I saw him getting ready to drive off in the truck, I decided to go ahead and talk to the man.
The owner was certain of his own innocence and so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally, I handle these situations quite well, but before I could finish what I wanted to say, the man had taken the word away from me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter offered to show him the receipt for the bike under the pretext of wanting to see it, and called the police himself.
"Yes, cool," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this sorted."
The scooter owner then proved ownership of the scooter and drove off.
Later, the rightful owner of the scooter told his story on Facebook, as previously reported.
In the short time that Bjartmar has been practicing this activity, he says he can count the number of times he has gotten into trouble with people on one hand.
"I have had peaceful interactions with the toughest guys in Reykjavík," said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are most often the smallest brothers and sisters of the community, addicts, mentally ill people, and other people who for some reason are on the streets.
"Addiction is a hard master and somehow one has to finance the next dose, unfortunately, theft of such liquid assets is an easy way to achieve that goal," says Bjartmar.
My interactions with these people are actually so good that I have a lot of the good people on my team with me.
Examples exist of people going through treatment and getting their act together and then coming to me to help with what I'm doing,'' he says.
Generally, Bjartmar's interactions with cyclists are courteous.
Some know about him and what he is doing and peacefully offer to show him receipts, license plates, and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has been little discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even now starting to point people towards him in connection with stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is unhappy with DV's previous reporting and says he is not some kind of self-appointed vigilante in a personal quest for justice.
Asked whether he is not now on thin ice with his actions, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says that this is certainly the case.
Of course the police should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are simply not doing it.
For example, I have watched policemen drive away from a large pile of stolen bicycles.
She is frankly clueless on these issues."
"When the police aren't doing anything about it, and it's right in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can be successful in this area, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He says he has been so successful in recovering stolen bikes that sometimes he runs into his "clients" on the street and they just hand him back the bikes they had previously stolen.
On the occasions when Bjartmar has called for police assistance, it has sometimes simply not been provided.
"This just isn't working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the bicycle owners' fault," said Bjartmar, who finds it unfortunate that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer from the inaction of the police in this area.
There is no debate about Bjartmar's success.
There are many stories of people thanking Bjartmar for recovering their possessions for them.
Bjartmar himself says he has long since lost count of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts are certainly in the millions, if not tens of millions.
Electric scooters, bikes, and mopeds are heavy on the roads, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a daycare during the day and every other weekend he works at a residential facility.
His bicycle search is therefore unpaid work that he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a big anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had indeed received pensions from the Danish king since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for civil servants was established, which eventually became the pension fund for all public servants.
The foundation for the current pension schemes for general wage earners was then laid with the all-encompassing collective bargaining agreements on the labor market in 1969, which stipulated occupational pension schemes with compulsory membership and full-fledged fund accumulation from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were enacted based on these agreements, and the pension system continued to grow after that.
The employees' pension system was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century achieved through its wage struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been achieved in a similar way during the famous strikes of 1955, and the organization also gradually achieved its demands for sick leave and health insurance, significant vacation rights, shorter working hours, housing improvements, and other such things that were of great importance.
All these rights came at a great cost and with a great struggle, but in retrospect they proved to be a much greater and more lasting gain than the increase in the amount of money in the pay packet, which quickly disappeared in the maw of inflation that characterized the post-war period up until 1990, as many will remember.
The lead-up to the establishment of universal pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although people eventually came to agree that the funds would ultimately become the property of the fund members, the labor movement had to accept that the boards would be composed of representatives of employers and fund members in equal numbers.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers in the boards of the funds was often discussed in labour unions, but it never came to fruition, and so we are still left with the abnormal situation where fund members are not in the majority on the boards of the funds.
Section 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on the Mandatory Pension Fund Guarantee and the Operation of Pension Funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
There, in Article 1, it says that "the pension fund shall have the interests of the members as its guiding principle."
The fifth item also states: "The pension fund shall set ethical guidelines for its investments."
In the shareholder policy of the Efling Trade Union Pension Fund, among other things, the following provisions follow on from the aforementioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in North America and Europe.
The rules discuss how a focus on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance, can contribute to improved investment performance of portfolios.
In this way, the interests of investors and the goals of the society are brought together in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those listed on the stock exchange, set public policies on: good corporate governance, fair remuneration, social responsibility and environmental issues.
Gildi, the largest pension fund in the country, has set itself a "policy on responsible investment" and contains provisions of a similar nature.
All of this is revisited here as an introduction to the latest fashion word in Icelandic, "shadow management."
As the term is new in the language, it is not surprising that it has not been fully defined, but I believe the following definition is currently the most widely accepted: Shadow management is when a union leader tells the media that he intends to instruct union representatives on the board of a pension fund to vote a certain way on a particular issue.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the first opportunity.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about the dismissal, it is not "shadow management" either, since such interactions between people are of course always present in the financial world, just as they are elsewhere.
I leave it to the reader to ponder which path he finds "more sinister."
There are primarily two men who have attempted to shape this definition as of the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, the Central Bank Governor.
The reasons for both were prompted by Bogi Nils Bogason, the CEO of Icelandair, announcing his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and stewards (fire them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the chairman of the Reykjavík Retailers' Union, sending out instructions to the union's representatives on the board of the Lífeyrissjóður verslunarmanna pension fund to not support the fund's potential acquisition of shares in the company, or they might be dismissed.
A little later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and Ragnar Þór followed suit with his recommendations, of course based on Bogi's decision.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw fit to elaborate on the matter in the Friday edition of Fréttablaðið, using strong words about shadow governance, law-breaking, and the urgent need for changes to the law.
There, a small thistle certainly had to shoulder a heavy burden, though blessed thistle was in a state of suspension and was quickly removed.
Since the matter is important, let's focus on the content itself at the end.
I mentioned earlier the provisions of the Pension Fund Law that relate to this matter.
This entails that the fund managers must look after the interests of the fund members and have ethical considerations in their investments, and these aspects are further elaborated in the regulations of both Gildi and Lífeyrissjóður verslunarmanna, as I mentioned.
Pension funds, however, should NOT solely focus on short-term profitability considerations in their investments.
Such a policy would be extremely dangerous and one does not have to look far back in history to find examples of this, where large loans from banks and funds have flowed to unscrupulous adventurers and environmental disasters, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on thin ice when he thought to wipe out an entire group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill the company has enjoyed on the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw the error of his ways and retracted it.
Time will tell whether this is sufficient to ensure that the pension funds' investment in the company can be considered prudent towards its members in the end.

One of the infected did not practice post-travel quarantine
One of the three people who tested positive for Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from an Eastern Baltic state on July 15 last, just over a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who is not permanently resident here and therefore did not receive clear instructions about the so-called homecoming quarantine after arriving in the country and taking another test a few days later.
He received a negative result from the border screening.
"But he is part of the Icelandic community and really should have gone into that option," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in infectious diseases at the Directorate of Health and acting chief epidemiologist while he is on vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
He used the English registration form, which does not require the ID number to be entered, and if the ID number is not entered, you are not automatically called for the second test.
She says that the man could have used the English form because he is actually resident abroad, but because of his network in the country as an Icelander, he should have rather used the Icelandic form.
He did not realize this, however.
When the ID number is not recorded, you have to request it yourself to schedule the second test.
Neither he nor his employer seemed to realize that this was the right way to go," says Kamilla.
So it is clear that we need to improve the information dissemination about this while we find some way to implement an automatic notification system even though Icelanders do not enter their ID numbers.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who the participants in the Icelandic community are in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, the individual encountered few upon arrival in the country, although he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, being an Icelander.
Only six have been sent into quarantine since he was diagnosed yesterday, and all six were in contact with him.
They are scheduled to undergo testing, but two of them are already showing symptoms of a Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative result from his border test on July 15.
Kamilla says it is likely that he was recently infected with the virus to the extent that it was not yet detectable in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the possibility that the man contracted the virus here in Iceland, but did not bring it with him to the country.
"It's not really possible to say that this is definitely an imported case because it's been so long since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed here like the two who caused a minor stir in connection with the sporting events."
However, she says it is very unlikely because the man interacted with so few people here.
"It's actually quite unlikely," says Kamilla, but adds that it cannot be ruled out until the Icelandic Genetic Diagnostics has sequenced the virus in the man.
"If we get a virus type that hasn't been seen here before, it is almost certain that it was brought in by him."
Pepper spray and explosives used against protesters
There were clashes between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and indiscriminate hand grenades against protesters, while protesters broke windows and set fires.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police brutality and racial discrimination were protested widely across the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered for peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
Subsequently, the police described the protests as riots, and there were clashes between groups of protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, protesters remembered Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police last August, and called for justice.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the Black National Guard gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police in her home in March last year.
The group carried firearms and marched in formation to a closed intersection where police separated the group from a group of people who also carried firearms and protested the protests.
Then, 75 people were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game against Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose to Wolves, Solskjær and his men will end up in 5th place and thus miss out on a Champions League spot.
They still have a chance to get into the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
We are not at the finish line yet.
If we manage to get points against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad season, said Solskjær.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a long way to go to catch the two teams above us," said Solskjær.
It is clear that the nerves of the players will be stretched at 15:00 today, but Solskjær tried to make it seem like it was just another game.
If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and the company is based on this.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is up to us to take advantage of it," said Solskjær.
This is not the most important game of the season, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football that the next game is always the most important one.
The results do not define our season, we have already had many moments that define this season."
"The arrival of Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I think overall we are in better shape and mentally stronger than last season," said Solskjær.
65,000 cases per day
65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were detected in the United States yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 cases have been confirmed across the Atlantic from the start of the outbreak in that country.
Yesterday, 900 people died from the virus, but in the four days leading up to that, deaths from the virus exceeded 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a CNN report, the number of deaths from the virus predicted by the US public health authorities will reach 175,000 by August 15th next year.
Fearing another wave of the epidemic
Spanish authorities are now trying, with limited success, to contain the further spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19 on both Thursday and Friday.
There have not been more cases detected in a single day since the beginning of May, and the news comes at the same time as the Spaniards begin to lift one of the strictest outdoor bans in Europe.
The setback led to British authorities now requiring passengers arriving from Spain to go into quarantine upon arrival.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in the northeast of Spain, where the authorities have imposed more extensive restrictions in an attempt to curb the growth.
In the capital city of Barcelona, nightclubs will be closed for the next two weeks and bars will be required to close at midnight.
Then, a curfew is now in effect for 200,000 residents in the Segria province in the western part of Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and has been badly hit by the pandemic.
Tui, the largest travel agency in the UK, cancelled all flights scheduled for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Authorities around the world are said to be preparing for a second wave of the pandemic, but there seems to be little interest in reinstating the widespread lockdowns that have devastated the economy.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reacted very negatively to such proposals, comparing them to nuclear weapons he does not want to use.
Then, Jean Castex, the Prime Minister of France, has said that the nation "would not survive economically or socially" if a nationwide lockdown were to be reinstated.
Many policymakers hope that local measures that target the residents of individual towns, cities, or regions will be sufficient to contain the virus in the next round if it occurs.
Five new cases of COVID-19 in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic cases were detected yesterday, in addition to two more at the border.
Thus, five individuals tested positive for Covid-19 in Iceland yesterday.
In a statement, the Civil Protection Agency says that one of the infections is linked to the one reported yesterday at the ReyCUP soccer tournament.
That person has been quarantined and sixteen who were in close contact with him have been sent into isolation.
The infected person was a participant in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavík and, according to the announcement, "only a part of the sports team" is in quarantine.
Others who were sent into quarantine are connected to the man in some other way.
The source of this infection is unknown and an investigation into the source is ongoing by the National Police Chief's Investigation Team.
The organizers of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the instructions and regulations of the Chief Medical Officer and Civil Protection Authority, which are still in force, and have made the appropriate arrangements.
However, the images from the tournament yesterday drew attention as they showed very close interactions where players were celebrating their team's good performance out on the field.
Just before 11 am today, the tournament organizers posted the following announcement on their Facebook page:
There it says "NOTE: Parents please respect the rule that competitors pick up their own equipment from the school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
Thank you for your apparent understanding."
Another case was detected yesterday but it is related to the case reported yesterday.
The announcement states: "Íslensk erfðagreining has sequenced the infections and a new type of virus has been identified that has not been detected here before."
An investigation into the source of the infection is also underway in this case, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third case referred to is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15.
It was detected in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation, and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine are also in isolation.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two were detected at the border and the results of further investigations are awaited, as the process for transmissions across borders requires.
Finally, the announcement states: The Civil Protection Department of the National Police Commissioner and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer urge people to exercise caution and pay close attention to individual measures to prevent infection.
If there is any doubt about whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to go to the nearest health center for testing.
Patreksfjörður says the campground is fully booked over the holiday weekend - directs visitors elsewhere
The campsite in Patreksfjörður is fully booked over the weekend, according to a statement from Vesturbyggð.
Guests are advised to consider other accommodation options.
Vesturbyggð mentions Bíldudal, Tálknafjörð, Melanes in Rauðasandur, Hotel Flókalund, and Hotel Breiðavík as other options in the situation.
There is plenty to do in Patreksfjörður this weekend, as, as in previous years, the Skjaldborg festival of Icelandic documentary films will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has thus become a strong tradition in the town.
Based on the demand for camping sites, one can expect a good turnout this year, provided the weather doesn't spoil things, but DV reported earlier today of a poor forecast.
However, the worst weather is expected to be in the south, and good news for Patreksfjörður residents.
The website bb.is reported first, saying that all other accommodation in the town was already fully booked.
Whole apartment building collapses in best location in the city
Romanian laborers can stay for free at Dunhaga 18–20.
While owners seek building permits for renovations, their applications have been stuck in the system for over three years.
In one of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive areas of the Reykjavík municipality, a magnificent apartment building stands on three floors.
The ground floor of the building has about 600 square meters of retail space.
Behind the house are doors to two stairwells, each of which contains four fairly spacious apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square meters, though most are over 100.
The house has a rich history.
It was built in 1959 and has housed a video rental, Skóstofan, the dairy store of Mjólkursamsalan, Jóa the gunsmith, a fish shop, and most recently, Háskólaprent.
The house, to put it mildly, has seen better days.
The house is now severely damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying photos.
The owner of the building is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are listed in the company register, among others, Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús led the ownership group of Borgun and was the representative of the ownership company Borgun.
Stálskip ehf. is among the owners of the holding company Borgun.
Stálskip ehf. is an investment company owned by Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún also owns a third of D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once ran the shipping company Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has done little or nothing to maintain it since then.
Neighbors say the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since then, though most so in recent years.
On a Facebook page for residents in the neighborhood, one resident says that the house "hasn't been particularly lively in recent years."
There may be a factor here in that the owners have been seeking to change the house and the lot for several years.
Other neighbors say the house has not been in good shape for a long time.
"It's long overdue to do something nice with this spot, and it's unfortunate that it has dragged on like this."
He also says that he is angry with the owners of the house for not having made an effort to finish this, find a common ground with the neighbors of the house, and stop this "legal nonsense."
"Just do it in consultation with the community around it so that we can get it done and finished."
The "legal tussle" the resident refers to is the planning process of the site, which has been ongoing at least since 2017.
Then, the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 applied for permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and a new lift house and an extension on one floor, as well as a basement, behind the building.
The building permit granted for that project was appealed to the Environmental and Resources Court of Appeal, which annulled it because the project was not in accordance with the zoning plan and the notification to the neighborhood was insufficient.
Reykjavík City then launched the zoning process and completed it with an announcement in Stjórnartíðindum in July last year.
That scheme was also challenged and the committee ruled it invalid in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the property were still at the starting line.
By this time, the house had fallen into disrepair considerably and the neighbors were starting to get tired of it.
When DV asked neighbors of the building about the situation, the responses from the neighbors were varied.
Some understood the intentions of the house owners, while others did not at all.
Some directed their anger at the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily at anyone in particular.
Still others said the parking spaces were a headache, but neighbors have been using the unused parking spaces of Dunhaga 18–20 for their vehicles.
One of the complainants in the case said they were long tired of the administration:
"It's unbelievable that we have to go through the process three times.
It's as if the Reykjavík City Council can't read."
Today, the house stands empty, abandoned and neglected.
A monument to the ephemeral city administration and the owner's and many years' worth of noble intentions that are now back at square one.
When a reporter arrived at Dunhaga 18, he was greeted by open doors and a garbage heap.
A Playstation computer and a recent television lay among other rubbish on the ground - victims of Icelandic summer heat.
The old University Press office was open, and there were a lot of cats there judging by the smell.
It is clear that someone has taken up residence in one corner, but they are not visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few piles of geological pages, presumably intended to become a book, loomed in front of me.
The apartment building's stairways were also open and there was life in both of them.
The reporter was fortunate enough to run into a resident of the other one.
There, the Romanians were cooking a potato dish for dinner and invited the reporter in.
The Romanians work for the staffing agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and according to sources at DV, the company has only paid for the housing, heating, and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not considered reasonable to charge rent.
Based on the number of mailboxes in the hallway of the building, it is clear that there has been a significant number of foreign workers living there in recent months.
The operation of staffing agencies has not been immune to the Covid-19 situation, as the downturn in tourism has led to a downturn in the construction sector, and these two sectors have been the most active in using staffing agencies' services.
Nevertheless, the residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do and hung their work clothes and gloves in the common area to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the terrible state of the house, the apartment that the boys shared appeared to be reasonably well maintained.
When the reporter bade the Romanian boys farewell, the irony suddenly hit him: In the best location in Reykjavík, a 1,500 square meter property is in a state of disrepair.
The owners want to improve the house and the neighbors want to improve the condition, but they disagree on the definition of "improvement."
In the middle sits the city's planning department, a victim of endless appeals and complaints in the planning process and a slow-moving resolution by the Environmental and Resources Tribunal.
The house is then inhabited by Romanian workers, perhaps just those who come to improve the situation when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article originally appeared in the DV weekend supplement on July 17.
In the fight against obesity following the coronavirus pandemic
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds for a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his serious illness, in part due to his weight.
Johnson is expected to launch the campaign, which has been given the name Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but the campaign will encourage doctors to prescribe cycling to overweight patients and will also include a push for more cycle paths.
Advertisements for fast food restaurants on television will be banned before 9pm in the evenings, according to British media sources.
"COVID-19 has raised our awareness of the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use this time to become healthier, more active, and eat healthier food," a government spokesperson said.
Johnson himself has struggled with weight issues, but he was hospitalized in the intensive care unit when he contracted the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly due to his weight that he is believed to have become so seriously ill.
Women are better suited to lead the changes
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step the nation could take towards greater decentralization, transparency, and in combating corruption and promoting the common good.
We need to shift gears a bit now, and who is better suited to lead such changes than the group of society that finds it easier to live by these values?
It's women," said Helga.
Women in Iceland are famous for their feminist movement.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
So now it's up to us to lead these changes."
She expressed some concern about the emphasis on Iceland as "the best in the world" both in terms of gender equality and human rights.
Then we are not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, the Swiss are very aware of their history and take care of everything that needs to be done.
There is a lot.
We need to know where we come from and understand the history and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don't all live under the same rules here," said Helga.
When asked, she said that women are in many ways in a good position in Iceland, but added that, like in many other places, Icelanders live under very masculine values.
She said that politics, for example, was about self-interest, domination and power, which were the forces that maintained injustice in all communities.
"Women have now set up this group and come together and are just getting a bit frustrated at the fact that the Alþingi keeps on ignoring this national referendum from 2012," she said.
It's these feminine values that we're thinking about when we consider this.
From human rights and environmental protection, to cooperation and the fact that we are all really sitting at the same table,“ she said, adding that the aforementioned values are the foundations of the new constitution.
We are a very rich country in terms of natural resources, and it is absurd that people live in poverty here.
It's ridiculous, we can do it differently," said Helga.
It's absurd that there is some natural law that dictates that women's jobs are always paid less.
It is absurd that flight attendants and nurses have to constantly fight for wage increases just to earn a decent salary.

Tried to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city center last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to steal money from them.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær, where two were arrested in connection with the case.
Then, the police stopped a motorcycle driver in the Hlíðar area where the driver was going at 146 km/h when the speed limit is 60 km/h.
Furthermore, he had previously been deprived of his driving privileges.
The police in the capital area had their hands full last night and recorded more than 80 cases in the police log from 5 pm yesterday to 5 am this morning.
There were particularly many noise complaints about discos.
On the eve of Saturday, eleven noisy parties were reported, which was considered a lot for the police's daily log.
However, last night, 22 noise complaints were reported to the police.
Six were detained in a cell overnight.
The police were called to Árbær last night when people fired fireworks into the air.
However, they managed to escape when the police officers arrived.
Nine drivers were stopped for drunk or drug-related driving.
Four were arrested last night for fighting in the city center, one of whom was detained in a cell.
Then two were taken to the emergency room after falling on their faces, one in the city center and one in the West End.
One person was taken to the emergency room after being injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who was towing a caravan on Kjalarnes yesterday.
The bicycle equipment of the trailer was, according to the police's logbook, in "very bad condition" and was impounded.
You can stay in Monet's house over the summer holidays
The house, which the Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life in, is now available for rent on the Airbnb website.
The next available nights in the house are over the holiday weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet first got the inspiration to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If anyone intends to rent the house, they must rent it for at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb site, it is next available for a week from the Sunday of the Bank Holiday weekend, so it might be a good idea for some holiday shoppers to book the painter's house quickly.
The two nights over the holiday weekend cost only 964 US dollars or roughly 130,000 Icelandic krónas, according to Fréttablaðið.
Dozens in quarantine and some of them are starting to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days, and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens have been quarantined due to this and some of them are starting to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three people were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday, and two at the border checkpoints.
A specialist at the Office of the Chief Medical Officer says that an increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in the community.
The strain of the previous domestic infection has been sequenced and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been circulating in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very vigilant now, said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the infectious diseases department of the Public Health Agency.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling will take place in the near future, but some who came into contact with the infected are now showing symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Now there is no influenza outbreak and there is less of other respiratory infections, so we can be quite liberal about doing these tests on individuals who, during the influenza season, would have been considered for something else first," said Kamilla.
Contact tracing is mostly complete, but it is not ruled out that more people will have to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected individuals were identified after attending sporting events.
This has raised the question of whether it is justifiable to hold such events.
The emergency communications manager says it is very possible as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
Kamilla says it is almost impossible that the infected people were infected at the sporting events.
If more people do not go into isolation after having come into contact with these individuals at these sporting events, then we can say that our infection control measures at the events have been effective.
But it hasn't been revealed yet," said Kamilla.
The procedures of the Civil Protection Department are constantly being reviewed.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems necessary," said Kamilla.
After just over a week, it is planned that the crowd limit will be expanded to 1,000 people.
This new position could affect the easing of restrictions.
"A certain meditation to cooking" - See Elísa Viðars menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is a soccer prodigy and plays for Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the daily grind and usually takes the time to cook a good and nutritious meal.
A typical day for me starts by going to work around eight in the morning, says Elísa.
"After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before picking up my daughter from the preschool around 3 p.m."
Elísa finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter early from the preschool.
It's good to have time with her before I go to practice later in the afternoon.
After practice, it's good to come home and just have to heat up dinner.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to clear our minds."
Elísa does not follow any particular diet.
She is finishing up her master's thesis in nutrition and knows well what works for her to have enough energy to work, go to school, take care of her family, and exercise.
What works for me is to eat a varied diet that is well balanced in terms of proteins, carbohydrates, and fat.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food as good or bad, but rather as nutritious or nutrient-deficient.
In fact, it's perfectly fine to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time.
Elísa has a very great interest in cooking.
There is a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen cooking, and I really enjoy that aspect of it.
I have to say that my confidence is with me in the kitchen, and I really believe that I am a decent cook.
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, left to soak overnight in almond milk.
Top off this meal with whatever is available at the time.
Most often it is banana and crunchy muesli & COFFEE.
I am a big coffee person.
Snacks: Extremely varied, but fruits or vegetables, flatbreads, plain yogurt with bananas and muesli, sandwiches, and I could eat hummus straight out of a box if that's what's available.
Lunch: I often make all sorts of hearty salads out of whatever is in the fridge, quinoa or bulgur, falafel balls, arugula, roasted vegetables with a good dressing, that's sort of what I'm working with.
If the schedule goes completely out of control (which happens often), the egg machine at work has come to my rescue more than once, and then it's two slices of bread with butter, cheese, and a boiled egg, I don't ask for more.
Snacks: I eat something carbohydrate-rich before training, such as bread with a topping, cereal, or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is often the choice at my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
City authorities in Seattle, Washington state, have declared a state of insurrection following widespread protests in the city center.
Yesterday, police used tear gas and flashbang grenades in an attempt to clear a large area that protesters had occupied and stretched over many house blocks in the vicinity of the city's parliament building.
The police reported on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into vandalism that was committed at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly involving some kind of explosive device.
City and police authorities say that protesters threw rocks, bottles, fireworks, and other loose objects at police, injuring one officer who was taken to a hospital.
The protests in Seattle were, however, peaceful for a long time at the beginning.
They were called to show solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there has been repeated violent clashes between protesters and heavily armed federal law enforcement units.
There, as in many other cities in the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, remembering George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protest against systemic racism in the American community, and demand change.
Not revoked until after the vote
However, it is still not clear whether the dismissals of Icelandair's flight attendants, which are scheduled to take effect next month, will be revoked.
The electronic ballot for the Icelandair cabin crew's collective bargaining agreement, on behalf of flight attendants, will end at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the union's chairman, is certain that Icelandair will not make a decision about the layoffs until the results of the vote are in.
"This definitely fits together," says Guðlaug Líney.
No dismissals have been revoked, this needs to be resolved so that we can man the aircraft.
Of course, people are naturally impatient to find out whether they will have work after the end of the month.
A vote is being held on a deal that was signed a week ago, in the early hours of July 19.
It is expected to remain in effect until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract that flight attendants had previously voted down.
On July 17, the Board and Executive Committee of the Icelandic Air Stewardess Association approved a call for a general strike at Icelandair, which was approved by the members in a vote.
She never came, but this was decided in the wake of Icelandair's decision to terminate negotiations with the Flight Attendants' Association, to lay off all its flight attendants, and to seek agreements with another trade union.
Then, the company's pilots were to temporarily take on the duties of the onboard security teams.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it's hard to say.
People are in pain after Icelandair's assault, when all the airline's flight attendants were fired and they were informed that another union would be negotiated with.
Now we'll see if it has an effect," she says.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair at the end of April, but then 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
Their notice period varies, for those with the shortest employment history it is three months and ends around the month of July-August.
In that group, about 90% of Icelandair flight attendants are included.
What happens if the agreement is not approved?
We then request continued negotiations with our counterparts.
With this agreement, we are meeting the demands of Icelandair.
If his appeal is rejected, it is clear that flight attendants feel they have been pushed too far."
Voting on the collective bargaining agreement ends and Icelandair will announce the results of the second quarter on tomorrow
The vote of flight attendants on a new collective bargaining agreement will end at noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's second quarter results will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary operating results indicate that the company's revenue has fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
Electronic voting on the collective agreement between the Icelandic Flight Attendants Association and the Confederation of Icelandic Employers regarding Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22nd, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27th, at noon.
Those who are eligible to vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay union dues to the Air Stewardess Association.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective bargaining agreement in the early hours of Sunday, July 19, but the previous day Icelandair had broken off negotiations with the union after flight attendants overwhelmingly rejected a previous agreement in a vote at the beginning of July.
Then, Icelandair had dismissed all of its flight attendants and flight crew on Friday, but they were reinstated after a new collective bargaining agreement was signed.
Under the new collective agreement, flight attendants have to work five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The collective bargaining agreement is valid until 2025, and it integrates provisions for pilots and flight attendants regarding how long they can work on a single shift.
The agreement was presented to members of FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, and many flight attendants that the news agency spoke to then expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Most seemed to agree, however, that the agreement had to be approved in order to keep the FFÍ alive.
Icelandair's second quarter results will be announced tomorrow, and the company's EBIT, its operating profit before financial items and taxes, is according to preliminary operating results negative by 100 to 110 million US dollars or about 15 billion Icelandic krónas.
Icelandair sent preliminary figures to the stock exchange last Wednesday, which showed that the company's revenue for the quarter was around 60 million dollars, or about 8.3 billion ISK.
The amount of cash and its equivalent was approximately 154 million US dollars at the end of the quarter, around 21 billion ISK.
Icelandair also aims to offer shares in the company for sale in August.
Icelandair aims to finalize agreements with fifteen creditors, including the government and Boeing aircraft manufacturer, before the end of the month, before going ahead with an initial public offering of shares.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
A new virus just means that it was an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been brewing domestically," says Már Kristjánsson, head physician at the infectious diseases department of Landspítalinn, about the news that "a new virus type" has been detected in the country.
Three domestic cases were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One person who had tested positive had participated in the Rey Cup soccer tournament, where they had taken part in club activities, but the source of the infection remains unknown and the tracing of the infection is ongoing.
In addition, a case was detected in an individual who arrived in the country on July 15, and two who were in contact with him have started to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, a case was detected that is related to a case reported on Tuesday, and after sequencing at deCODE Genetics, it was revealed to be "a new type of virus that has not been detected here before."
Contact tracing has been completed in relation to that infection.
Már points out that this is not a new virus, but rather the same virus that has spread all over the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to talk about a new variant of that virus rather than a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could say anything about the start of another wave of the epidemic, Már says that, as far as he knows, it is a single case and it may be that nothing more will come of it.
"However, if there are cases reported domestically that are not linked to cases abroad and have the same genetic profile as this particular variant, then it would be possible to draw the conclusion [of a second wave] but it is premature at this stage," explains Már.
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to the happiness of the Icelanders hidden in the hot tubs?
BBC programme makers lead us to the conclusion in a fun video that sheds light on the country's pool and hot tub culture.
Icelandic bathing culture is unique in the world, and it is claimed that nowhere else in the world has as many bathing facilities per capita as Iceland.
The natural geothermal heat is the foundation, but also the tradition of swimming here plays a role.
Swimming instruction for children was mandated in 1940, but older citizens are no less enthusiastic about using the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as a fixed part of the general well-being of the nation.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class or status.
Free from mobile phones, people talk to each other on a personal level about home and abroad or enjoy the soothing power of water: meditating and recharging the soul and body.
A hundred days to go until the elections
One hundred days remain until Americans go to the polls and elect a president for a four-year term.
Donald Trump seeks re-election, but he has a tough road ahead.
Joe Biden, the likely Democratic Party candidate, has a significant lead over Trump nationwide, according to opinion polls.
According to a new poll by the AP news agency, a record number of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the new coronavirus pandemic is also very unpopular, and more Americans than ever before believe that the president has handled the economy badly.
Specifically, only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the pandemic and 48 percent say he has handled the economy well.
In March, it was 56 percent and in January, it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden has 49.9% support nationwide while Trump has 41.9%.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention away from his performance in relation to the pandemic to Biden, highlighting so-called cultural divisions and promoting policies that are supposed to focus on law and order.
Biden's campaign, however, is putting a lot of effort into keeping the focus on Trump and believes there is a good chance of winning if the election is really about how Trump has performed in his job over the past four years.
Trump's unpopularity also seems to be affecting Republican members of Congress, and the GOP leadership fears that the Democrats could even gain a majority in the U.S. Senate, which until now has been considered highly unlikely.
Politico reported recently that if the parties and candidates' support remains similar to what it is now, the Republican Party would suffer its worst defeat in decades.
The suburbs proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 general election and it now looks like this trend will continue.
Trump has recently tried to frighten suburban residents into following him, among other things by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy suburbs in the United States and promote racial divisions.
Among other things, Trump has cancelled a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in suburbs.
Then he urged "housewives" in the suburbs of the United States to read an article by a former New York deputy state secretary, in which she claimed that Biden would destroy the suburbs, and Trump agreed with that.
Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it better!" said the president.
Residents of the suburbs of the United States are an ever-growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of votes from this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the suburbs in 2016, his support there has significantly declined.
Although the results vary between polls, Biden has recently been ahead of Trump by about fifteen percentage points in the swing states.

Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnels?
After the final decision was made to postpone the Olympics, an event that has only been disrupted by world wars until now, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic flame would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," likely referring to the global coronavirus pandemic that the world is currently going through together.
Athletes have an additional year to prepare and the authorities in Japan are incurring additional costs due to the delay.
However, everyone keeps their head above water, as a lot is at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympics this year, the Japanese delegation's celebrations were genuine.
They cried and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to host the games in 2016 but lost out that time to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo City and Japan would bask in the attention of the world.
The games were originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed for a year and will now start on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If it is not possible to hold the games then, if the coronavirus is still too great a threat, the games will be cancelled.
However, no one really wants to think that thought to the end.
The Olympic Games are no ordinary sporting competition.
Nothing is spared, the show always has to be spectacular and strives to top the last one.
The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the evaluation of the cities' presentations by a selection committee.
The more impressive the presentation, the greater the chances of winning the prize.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars in an attempt to get the 2016 Olympics, which is equivalent to roughly 20 billion króna.
In the second instance, when the games of 2020 were bid for, 75 million dollars, about ten billion kroner, was put into the campaign.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the games this year, Japanese authorities had already committed 30 billion ISK to the project.
But that amount is still a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build an Olympic village, venues, and generally strengthen the country's infrastructure to host such an event, prepare for it, and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be underway these days but has been postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
However, in a report released by the Japanese Auditor General at the end of last year, it was revealed that the cost was actually double that figure.
It is likely that the cost of postponing the games cannot be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could range from 15 to 30 billion dollars.
The numbers are so high that all the tax revenue of the Icelandic state would only cover just under half of an Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of economic analysis, with economists trying to decipher the figures and assess the benefits and advantages of the Games.
In short, it seems that a great many people have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympic Games are far from positive for the economies of the cities that host them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, there is a very large increase in jobs for a short period of time, but in the long term, cities often end up with a debt burden and high operating costs for little-used infrastructure.
Rio de Janeiro in Brazil is left with significant debts from the 2016 Games and has struggled to maintain the large sports facilities built for the Games.
Analysis of figures after the London 2012 Games has revealed that only 10 percent of those who gained employment related to the Olympics in the city were previously unemployed.
This means that there were no new jobs created, except to a small extent.
Generally, cities have not fared particularly well financially from hosting the Olympics due to the overwhelming cost of the infrastructure built for the games.
However, the benefits are often considered to lie in increased tourist traffic seeking to visit the Olympic cities after the games, although there is considerable uncertainty regarding the 2021 games.
It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to accommodate all the usual number of spectators.
However, the main thing is the honor that the cities receive for being chosen, which is difficult to put a price on.
After all, despite the enormous cost, one can also say that the joy that the Games bring is not of a nature that can be put a price on.
But although the show is often grand and extravagant, and no expense is spared, it's not just about money, of course.
It is the sporting heroes who are in the spotlight.
For some of the athletes, it is actually a welcome relief to postpone the games.
Australian five-time Olympian and gold medalist in her event at the last Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, for example, is pregnant and would have been far from fit this summer, but hopes to be in competitive shape for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just reasonably happy about the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who intended to retire after this year's games, the postponement of the games means that they will retire before the games take place in some cases.
Their bodies simply cannot handle going through more years of intense training.
Few athletes managed to so thoroughly capture the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics like gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold medals around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has given a few interviews in her home country, the United States, recently to discuss the Olympics.
She is aiming for the 2021 Olympics, but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of her game at the next Olympics, which will be next year, when she will be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is above average for a top-level gymnast.
"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but smiles wryly when asked in an interview published on the IOC's Instagram page whether she intends to match her performance at the 2021 Games with that in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll still be on top after another year of training," says Biles.
She has previously spoken about how her body can no longer handle the stress of gymnastics training for much longer.
Nevertheless, she trains vigorously for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop training when the pandemic was at its peak and the gymnastics hall was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles any more than for others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold medals could not buy her any access beyond the others; she had to find various ways to stay in shape like everyone else.
The basic form is certainly better than in most people.
We have a tight schedule now.
It was difficult to start training again when the gymnastics hall reopened for the first time.
We started slowly but are back on track and I will gradually increase the training as the year goes on.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will go or whether they will be held, but we still train as if they will be, we have no choice.
I've put in too much effort to leave the sport now," says Biles.
Like her, others harbor doubts or perhaps a more conscious awareness that the games may not be held at all in 2021.
Predicting it, however, is a lost cause.
Nobody knows how the situation with the global coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021, and there is nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics assuming they will be held a year from now.
Perhaps the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Wedding postponed due to pandemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are more important things to think about right now," the actress said in a conversation with People.
We definitely want to get married at some point and have the dream wedding with all our loved ones present.
But we decided to put it on hold and focus on what's important right now, and that is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I am more focused on world affairs than wedding matters these days.
There is a lot going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world."
