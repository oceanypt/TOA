A great return of the Czech loser is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-three-year-old native of Plzeň will be on the bench and could soon find himself in goal.
The former goaltender of Litvínov, Plzeň, or the Russian Chelyabinsk, injured himself during NHL preparations in October of this year.
He was exactly halfway through the game against Vegas when he was substituted, and has not appeared on the NHL ice since then.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to the other.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver team announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL net eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, U.S. time, he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he made 94.5% of his saves.
The Plzeň hockey prodigy wants to finally make a name for himself and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In the last season, he had problems with his hips and did not play a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "Francík" played in 36 matches, with a save percentage of 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on Camille in the Christmas greeting, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas greeting.
Prince Charles also published his wish, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at the races.
The British news agency BBC reported about this on its website.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues, and foundations with whom they collaborate.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing long summer dresses in khaki color and so is Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is dressed in shorts and a polo shirt just like Princes George and Louis.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, and it is not clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas greeting in a pile of straw in front of a stack of wood at their country estate in Norfolk County, where they posed in front of a pile of wood.
The picture, which serves as a Christmas greeting, was also released by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the heir to the throne.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured him in June at the Ascot races.
Charles, who is wearing a cylinder on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her matching mask with her light-colored dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbr a million for the title, but Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - In the current corruption case, criminal investigators are said to have worked on the assumption that the accused former deputy chairman of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, was promised a million crowns from Slavia Prague for winning the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The efotbal.cz server reported this, stating that it had gained access to a part of the police files.
The chairman of the Vršovice club board, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red and whites did not engage in any corrupt practices.
The website published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar figures prominently, who left the top club last summer.
The former influential official of the red-and-whites was, according to the indictment, in frequent contact both with Berbr and with the former sports director of then second-tier Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also a defendant in the case.
Criminal investigators reportedly worked with the information that Slavia had promised Berbrovi a financial reward if they won the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Prague team won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to receive a million-dollar bribe from SK Slavia Prague officials in exchange for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
The next day, according to the criminal investigators, Berbr met not only with Nezmara, but also with Slavia's board chairman Tvrdík.
According to the website, the file does not provide any further information on whether the police are still investigating this information.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt practices.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively sought to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative approach to its development.
We have never engaged in any illegal activity, we have not attempted to influence the referees in violation of the fair play rules, and we have not provided any financial compensation to anyone in connection with this," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the recordings, Nezmar, among other things, insults some former Slavia players of darker skin, and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
Last year in mid-October, a police raid at several locations, including the headquarters of the FAČR in Prague, triggered the case of alleged match-fixing through referees.
The highest-ranking person in the scandal is Berbr, who no longer holds any football positions.
In mid-January, he was released from custody just like the former Vyšehrad sports director Rogoz, who was also arrested.
Helicopters, tanks, and BVP are cold war larping.
The guns will be new, but of a fundamentally inferior type (artillerymen will have to fire from an armored cabin and load the ammunition by hand without any protection).
Cars - Toyota Hi-Luxes - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, and it has already been possible to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types with no combat potential
Rockets - we have none at all (but we manufacture and export them)
PVO: medium-range - Cold War, obsolete; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like that.
My hunting ground is right next to the town.
Nutria were climbing out of the river and damaging crops, so I went down there to take care of it.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I calmly sat down and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped he would leave before something came out, but of course, the fox was soon in the henhouse.
I let her come in 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
Poor fisherman almost shit himself, he was waving the flashlight around in all directions, so I called him and told him it was a fox.
Before I dismounted, it was gone.
That is, a meadow can be a pigsty.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a series of coincidences for something to happen, and you would probably be seen on a thermal imaging device, which almost everyone has today.
So, in a visible place, put your valuable things under your feet in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Ministry of the Interior acquired respirators much more cheaply than the Ministry of Health
The state responsible for purchasing and distributing masks, respirators, and face masks for professions closest to the coronavirus has issued billions of crowns in recent weeks for their acquisition.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the prices for respirators varied by hundreds of crowns on a single day.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities acted prudently?
And why did others buy more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I am not affected by memories of the Czechoslovak People's Army, which older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large stocks of equipment that the trained personnel could take charge of, and we don't even have modern equipment for the current professionals, and modern equipment is still becoming more complex, so the reservists' skills will rapidly deteriorate over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can be deployed, will take place very quickly, and there will be no time to retrain someone.
Finally, the reserves/territorial defense have a great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrilla warfare and it is also an explicit necessity to deter the enemy.
In the Czech Republic, a guerrilla war can only be fought successfully in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not have the appropriate geography for it.
We don't have individual skills.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
This then leads to such situations where you look like a macho guy who just 2 minutes ago missed an empty goal, driving into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss players and thinking to yourself, "what do you think is going to happen now?"
Of course, they will choose him like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "tripping up the defender" is so bad that I caught myself being genuinely surprised when I saw that our attacker managed to beat one of the opponent's players.
The first swallows
The COVID pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major turnaround in the coming weeks.
The pressure on hospitals according to statistical models is expected to continue for some time yet, and the pandemic equation now includes a new unknown factor: the Omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently dominant Delta variant.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course of the disease, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired from a previous infection can help.
This week, however, the covid equation also received an unexpected boost from the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and the associated hospitalization by a third, and it can be administered at home.
Soon, the drug Paxlovid from Pfizer should also be added to this list, which from the current results claims a success rate of up to 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, have also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for the incoming drugs.
As mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients will be molnupiravir by Merck.
The company ended up on the list first, in part, because the drug was developed long before the current pandemic began, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for equine viral diseases in South America.
In these studies, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
Meanwhile, Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to speaking "without a care in the world."
Look, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you straight out that they don't.
In the West, they will tell you how much they love immigration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They fear cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and being subjected to a media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, the West good, the East bad.
But do they really know what people think?
Only in France do Le Pen and Zemmoura, both of whom have over 20% according to the poll, exist.
We even know that the objects are three in number and are identical to each other. They are Czech.
They are identical for the sake of rotating units so that soldiers do not have to relearn where everything is, and all the objects are exactly the same down to the last detail.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy, and the other two are abandoned.
It's funny that the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or because of the faster deployment of warheads due to its more western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple tree), only the warheads, not the entire rockets, were stored, as they say.
If this weapon was needed, a special unit would come to pick up and mount the head onto some sort of carrier device.
In addition to the museum's oak tree, the rest are in a deplorable state.
At the second level of primary school, we had a classmate who was a Gypsy, and we were together for four years.
He was pretty relaxed, made good jokes, was a bit too expressive, but he was our mascot.
Everyone liked him, he often came and wanted to explain something, he was missing very little, he came regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, and he always came neatly dressed.
He went on school trips, did all sorts of pranks, but was always cool, never had any major mishaps.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, Roma, entered the same grade, but different classes.
Shortly afterwards, they beat up the teacher, and the police were often called there to deal with something, they threatened and intimidated other students...
Personally, I sometimes sell something on an ad (old things, things I don't need, etc.) and I've often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they didn't try to cheat me on the price, and the communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called me up a month later to say that he had already transferred the ownership to himself...
I say to myself that I am not a racist, and that it doesn't matter to me whether someone is white, black, yellow, blue, or any other colour, as long as they behave in a way that is appropriate in a civilised society (works, functions, doesn't beat women, just normal behaviour).
But when someone comes, they stretch out their hand, evict people from their apartments and houses, and leave a mess behind them... it doesn't matter what color they are, but I will be bothered by it.
I have no problem with African migrants if they integrate with us, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily, but at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, it doesn't matter to me as long as they respect my traditions and culture, and I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice
"A young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts, she unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for the South Bohemian Emergency Medical Service.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was taking the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot car was probably travelling from Žíchovec towards Bavorov when, for reasons yet unknown, he veered off the road in a curve and drove in the opposite direction.
After colliding with a Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road, according to Štěpánka Schwarzová, spokesperson for the South Bohemian Police.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It was a multiple injury and he was trapped in the car.
After being freed, he had to receive urgent pre-hospital care and was then airlifted to the České Budějovice hospital in a stable condition, said paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered lighter injuries to the chest and was taken to the hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, and customers often fail to provide the required information
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects collectible cards.
"Usually, it can be tens of dollars, say, from ten dollars upwards, where it still makes sense to import them, especially from Japan, where postage is often free," explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive. He now has to add VAT and provide customs information to the post office.
He receives an email informing him that customs are expecting the package to arrive.
Then, you just need to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the seller did not include VAT in the sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and the transportation.
In the case that the recipient does not handle customs clearance themselves, the carrier's fee must also be added to the total amount.
However, according to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I check one or two checkboxes, add two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all deliveries go smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the number of international packages received daily at the Prague post office has fallen from 60,000 to 15,000.
In addition, according to Česká pošta, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests for information that is needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the information that is required and did so in time, we would be about halfway there, says Matyáš Vitík, spokesperson for the Czech Post.
Solutions to inflation
See the title for how you would propose a solution to the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
For example, we see a reduction in VAT on food and petroleum products in Poland, is this the way forward for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it's headed?
Prices are rising faster than wages, and I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much extra did you get, for example (who is an employee)?
This year they added 2% to my gross salary, which is a joke, but fortunately I have similar income from the business I run alongside my job.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why proven violent offenders are sent to prison for just six months, for example?
This just doesn't make sense to me. How can a court sentence an animal to six months in a cage just because it will do it again as soon as it gets out?
Six months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
And that's not even taking into account the fact that the victim of rape may never recover from it.
Will this not also deter potential future reports of sexual assault victims?
The man from Hrob "shot" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from Hrob unintentionally helped the police officers to apprehend his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He himself called her there.
He went about it indirectly.
He first approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
When the police arrived at the scene after being called to the emergency line, they were astonished to learn that the alleged "victim" had made up the story just to get them to come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to ask the police officers how to file a report with the Czech Police.
During the identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the guards discovered that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and that there was a warrant for her arrest.
The case is being handled by the PČR.
A sincere question for people here: do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally Slavic, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, it's a shame that Churchill didn't manage to liberate Prague with the help of the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's a question whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence, just because it might potentially be beneficial.
I would not consider such a case to be true faith in my personal opinion.
I cannot agree with Pascal here; there are estimated to be around ten thousand different religions in the world, if I am not mistaken.
Which god or gods should a person then choose to worship?
I would say that it is fairly likely that in one of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you quite nastily if you believe in a different god.
After all, the Ten Commandments say that there is no other god but Jehovah.
In such a case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god, than to risk picking the wrong one of the thousands of gods out there and ending up in hell or some similar place for not believing in the one true god I just happened to miss?
Others: Voluntary training followed by reserve duty.
The Swiss model is similar, I think.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for each) under the guidance of professionals with practical experience.
If a person does well, they may receive a professional offer.
All the components of the AČR would benefit from something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can say this: There is constant talk about collaboration between the education sector and industry, companies hunt for talent in schools, and there is some kind of blurring, whereby workforce moves from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, and each of us is constantly learning new things, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar blending should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build some kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, which is an institution that ensures that no Russian, German, or Mongolian invader will ever invade again.
It seems funny to me how you consider NATO to be something carved in stone. We have allies and they will defend us if things go wrong.
Well, praise the Lord.
Just one election in the US can shrink their budget, and the entire NATO goes down the drain.
The Anglani will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they will take whatever they want if you just show them your back.
The only thing that has proven to be a long-term guarantee of independence is a heavily armed army and a population that is capable of operating military technology of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remotely controlled devices, so why not?
We don't need border fortifications anymore, they're obsolete nowadays, but a hulking teenager behind a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a tidal wave of cardboard
You open presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're overwhelmed with boxes and packing materials at home?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of stores that welcome your used boxes has been created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
It is a shame to treat them as disposable one-time use items.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating businesses (there are nearly 150 of them on the KAMsNIM.cz project map) upon agreement.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created, and also avoid overfilled blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the saved money, since the packaging carton has increased in price by 50% over the past period.
In the eyes of eco-conscious customers, this also strengthens my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-friendly cleaning products and cosmetics.
Boxes and packing materials are brought to Popůvky near Brno by individuals who have accumulated them at home, but we also receive enquiries from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of discarded cardboard.
We will use it when packing parcels from our online shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies alike, we are creating a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application, however, not only shows collection points for packaging materials, but also for other materials.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to donate expired medicines, tires, obsolete electronics, batteries, light bulbs, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can end up in the right place, and reusable items can find a second home.
The project map already contains over 100,000 such places in total.
"Gradually, more and more recycling centres, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, swap events, and other places that help find a use for things that would otherwise become unnecessary waste are being added to it," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the app from the Ukliďme Česko association.
It seems to me that it's bad that in today's age, technology is so simple and idiot-proof that children who use a computer or a phone to play games don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of components on a computer.
For example, Google Photos or Apple photo apps, or even mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and present everything on one screen in the app.
They can use the technique from childhood, but most importantly they should learn something.
Rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron unveiled the priorities of the French EU presidency, which begins in January, over the weekend, and it was quite impressive.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work and on the streets - and mentioned so many events that they cannot be completed within half a year.
However, French politicians like it that way and voters like it too.
Macron's supporters who straddle the divide between right and left agree on little, but on Europe they are in agreement.
And in France, there will be new presidential elections in April.
The election calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "a single history of Europe" and that France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators quickly jumped on the criticism that Macron is pursuing a pro-European propaganda agenda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are more trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is currently touring France with the claim that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not as bad as people think, and he is having quite a bit of success with this message among the French.
Let's take Macron's idea about one history textbook seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries are often taught history as a story of us versus them, rather than as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, and Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't learn about the wider context of the event.
Film of the Year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for direction and best actress Jasna Duričič.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, it was at the top of the audience chart.
In Berlin, Anthony Hopkins was named Best Actor for the film Father.
I'm not that young, I'm not that healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was sort of like "having the flu/being hungover" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't have much of an appetite for smoking...
It was worse than the common flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(This is just my personal experience. I am not claiming that this is the case for everyone)

In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story of returning from emigration than we are used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a life together.
Trains are starting to run according to the new timetable, and in some places the operator will change
From Sunday, trains will start running according to the new timetable on the railways.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some routes, for example, between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet will replace České dráhy.
For most lines, only the departure times are adjusted, and in some cases the route is also slightly modified.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Transport operators started selling tickets already during the autumn.
Czech Railways plan to operate an average of 6,783 passenger trains per day in the new timetable, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the new timetable will also include routes to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new timetable, will put dozens of new trains into service.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on routes from Prague to Cheb.
The operator will also launch new trains in northern Moravia and in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also, as is traditional, increase ticket prices from next year, on average by 3.2 percent.
Railways incorporate inflation into their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in RegioJet's timetable is the introduction of the R23 line connecting Ústí nad Labem, Mělník, Nymburk, and Kolín.
The carrier will replace České dráhy here, after winning a competition held by the Ministry of Transportation.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 trains daily on the route, eight in each direction.
Other changes affect long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at the stations of Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou, and Kolín.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain as similar timetables as possible for its long-distance trains despite the planned maintenance work.
Without major changes, train operations by Arriva and other carriers should continue as normal.
The carrier will also change in some regional lines.
Passengers can expect changes, for example, in the Liberec region, where trains from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk will be operated by Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn instead of the Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use the unified rail fare for the second year in a row.
Like with České dráhy, their price will increase by 3.2 percent due to inflation.
I must disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work hard, and how they died.
In my life, I have never heard a lesson from the perspective of the slave owners or from that time; no one defends it, only condemns it.
Nobody will tell you in school that black people often sold black people into slavery themselves, and that they were often the worst slave traders.
Nobody will teach you at school that colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they will only tell you how brutally we, Europeans, wiped them out, when in fact they had been killing each other for a long time.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I have not encountered anyone deliberately concealing facts, but I have heard that this does happen, and I think it is a problem (for example, in Japan, the atrocities of WWII are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white, and that we tend to view it from today's perspective, without understanding it.
History doesn't care about people's feelings; it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn something without taking into account the circumstances at the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat it.
By the way, when we're talking about the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave owners are quite popular there, but on the other hand, they also had some of their own good successes, and it seemed absurd to me to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better than it is often idealized today.
And a lot of people also forget that not all Southerners were slave owners, and a lot of things went against them too.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, lie, and manipulate, and on top of that, our perspective doesn't exist there (there was also a video on YouTube from a TV station where they cut someone off who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What struck me as funny about US schools was the rise of Marxism and idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that at some universities it was quite shocking, those students were quite radicalized and the schools often supported them in that.
And when I imagine that these people will one day be much older, it makes me a little sick to think that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is present among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has already achieved what it set out to achieve and has become radicalized.
Currently, those who identify as feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts, just like other groups such as LGBT, which leads to radicalization on both sides, often resulting in opposition even to quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, at the end of the day, I haven't encountered anyone who has condemned me for colonialism or slavery.
I encountered more bad geography than anything else, but it was mutual :D
Not because I didn't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality to be generally superfluous in terms of personal identity.
If something connects me to people, it's interests, worldviews, and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek-Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but he always manages to say something embarrassing about the coronavirus that makes everyone cringe.
Of course, there is also the Czechoslovak Husita Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernism and are essentially Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics but go to services at the Hussites because it is theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on the street Botanická.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and they even hold a Latin Mass there every Sunday at 3 p.m., just like they did before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem Flame is in the Czech Republic, Scouts took it over from Austria
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not travel to Vienna for him this time either. In the morning, they received him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing.
They also took it over at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year with the troop, and I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
Last year, the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge. This year, it took place at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing on a parking lot.
However, scouts usually take the train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes in the delivery of the flame across the Czech Republic.
The Scouts traditionally travel by train to Brno, where they will deliver the Bethlehem light to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle, and then on to Prague.
On Saturday, December 18, the Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent delivery of the light, travelling by selected express trains and passenger trains.
From them, the light will be taken over by local scouts or volunteers at the stations, who will then spread the flame further across the Czech Republic, even to places where the tracks do not reach.
As in previous years, scouts must comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's similar to last year.
We recommend that both courier teams and event organizers wear masks, maintain social distancing, have as few people as possible, don't sing to each other, and generally behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described Zuzana Hrbková, the spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels across Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The aim is to spread the flame along with the idea of peace, friendship, and harmony.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope for believers, a light that overcomes the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts have been fighting the spread of it for more than 30 years.
The event is based on the work of hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of altruism and humanity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come to get a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I'm not familiar with the basics of economics, which confirm that subsidies are a cancer for the economy. However, I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, the environment (e.g. water retention), healthcare, and education will put these funds to good use, I just don't understand why they are put into agriculture, industry, and businesses in general.
As mentioned, it produces a useless product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company."
I myself work in a factory where there are a million notices on the corridors saying "XY financed/co-financed by project XY" and such a company is simply kept artificially afloat.
This is not support for a company that provides jobs to x people, this is stifling development where this company is just barely hanging on and taking away orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Absolutely, it's terrible.
Even a person born in the internet age can fall for some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think that I'm immune to online advertising, but then I still fall for it and end up being influenced by it - it's just too well done to resist.
For this reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament, which are currently calling for a complete ban on programmatic advertising...
It's all filth, in the words of the classic - I would ban the internet.
I feel that this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that the majority believe in and makes sense, I am not a sheep after all, but I would rather believe something that is less likely, even though it doesn't make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion that I will claim is critical thinking"
2. "I certainly won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television has fallen prey to the trend of Christmas movies, and this year there are two hundred premieres
Los Angeles - Cinemas, television stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen prey to the trend of Christmas movies and this year will premiere a record number of more than two hundred to their viewers.
The operator of the IMDb film database calculated it.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring with audiences in recent years, and has significantly increased viewership, so more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times as many Christmas films were made as in 2011, and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb's database only included films in its tally that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their title, so there are actually many more holiday films out there.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is mainly associated with fairy tales, while globally popular films include Home Alone, Love Actually, and the classic Christmas story It's a Wonderful Life from 1946.
The real boom in Christmas movies, however, didn't start until 2009, when the American cable television channel Hallmark came out with a special film series, reminded the BBC website.
Her Advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Countdown to Christmas) at that time included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station started tuning its viewers into the Christmas spirit as early as October 22nd, and will show a total of 42 Christmas movies.
Competitor channel Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total.
"In this magical time of year, the story doesn't matter as much; what's important is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of the book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, jokingly described this genre.
"For viewers, it's a form of escape and a way to at least feel a little calm amidst all the holiday madness and the madness of the world we've been living in for the past few years," Gray added.
For example, the Hallmark Channel uses the same recipe for its movies, which is uniform but successful, according to him.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end some misunderstanding arises, which is successfully resolved and the two kiss.
This is always the case, and as long as all the films look the same and have the same atmosphere, people watch one after another, adds Gray.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not participate in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will compete in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not compete in the final race of the season.
The Haas stable will only send one Formula 1 car onto the track.
In the final race of the season, he was aiming for a better position than the 20th place he qualified for.
Russian driver Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, however.
He was positively tested for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will line up on the starting grid, with Mick Schumacher, Mazepin's teammate, starting from the last position, and Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title, starting from the first.
Mazepin is reportedly in fairly good shape according to the Haas team, and shows no signs of illness.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
Now in isolation, he will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," his representatives said on formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement driver to the race, and cannot do so.
A potential substitute would have to go through qualifying or race in another part of the weekend.
The first runner is not affected by COVID-19.
During the recently concluded season, Kimi Räikkönen had COVID-19, while last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.

From a legal perspective, COVID is listed as an infectious disease.
That is, in the same group as HIV, the plague, hepatitis, or typhus.
§ 152 Spreading a contagious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of the introduction or spread of a contagious disease among humans shall be punished with imprisonment for six months to three years, a ban on activities, or the forfeiture of property.
(2) The perpetrator will be punished by imprisonment for two to eight years, with the loss of freedom for two years
c) if he violates such a duty arising from his employment, profession, position, or office, or one imposed on him by law.
d) if such an act causes serious bodily harm.
(3) The perpetrator will be punished by imprisonment for three to ten years, if the act described in paragraph 1 causes serious bodily harm to at least two persons or death.
(4) The perpetrator will be punished with imprisonment for five to twelve years, if he causes the death of at least two persons by the act described in paragraph 1.

Gold, silver, and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze you!
It's a bit like a portable jewellery shop, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters weren't really worn much at home," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours over the course of half a year working on his creation.
The silk was bought in Italy, the 24-carat gold thread in France, and 2000 decorative crystals were provided by Swarowski.
The silver stars were then adorned with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater its softness," praises the creator of his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The previous most expensive sweater sold five years ago was "just" 720,000 crowns.

On the situation in the US with a leading African-American reporter.

You can argue that the money from those subsidies could be used better, but that's a completely different discussion.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers, and drone pilots could depart before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish colleagues with protecting the border with Belarus and building the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested the assistance of NATO member states in connection with the several-month-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of countries in the Middle East to its territory with a false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.

Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
Currently, we have reported another suspected case of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
There is no evidence of direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov Primary School," said Ciupek.
Six cases were reported in the region last week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Influenza and Non-Influenza Virus Reference Laboratory of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that it consists of two nurses from one workplace at the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils from the Adamov Primary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, while four have no symptoms at all.
No one traveled abroad with a suspicion of Omicron
None of the listed individuals traveled abroad, nor did any of their family members, and there was no contact with anyone who lives abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship for any of the people mentioned, said Ciupek.

California will restrict the sale of firearms.
He wants to proceed as Texas did in banning abortions.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain firearms in the most populous US state using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law banning abortions after detection of a fetal heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles or homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to the Friday ruling of the US Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in place, despite it being in conflict with a nearly 50-year-old precedent-setting verdict that established the right to abortion nationwide up to about 24 weeks of pregnancy.
However, the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but rather on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban was delegated to the public in this case, thereby preventing Texan Republicans from challenging it through the usual legal channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the maintenance of Texas' ban on most abortion services and to a large extent supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," said the governor of California.
"If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He reportedly tasked his subordinates with working in cooperation with the state parliament and the minister of justice to implement measures that would authorize public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
This term is used to refer to homemade weapons that are not serialized and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) and legal fees from anyone who manufactured, distributed, or sold assault rifles, "ghost gun" components, or kits for their production in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then we should exactly that," said the governor of California.
The AP agency notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the ban in June, deeming it unconstitutional.
If the state were to now actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, the words of the liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor would be confirmed, who in her dissenting opinion to the majority verdict on Friday warned against the expansion of the legal mechanism to other American states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas' abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue lawsuits against certain state officials in the southern United States.
Every emergency vaccination has a public testing phase, where the vaccination scheme is gradually developed and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
For example, from Israel, there are already large-scale studies on the effects of a fourth dose.
According to these studies, in most patients, antibody levels increase up to fivefold, which already has the long-term effect that you mentioned.
Basically, like any other vaccination, it will eventually have its own vaccination schedule, but it's too early for that right now.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on inactivated virus is expected to hit the market soon, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting unlawfully if it used its new powers to suspend payments to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law, Ziobro said.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to draw 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism that allows the withdrawal of EU funding from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU by vetoing all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the head of the small Solidarity Poland party, whose votes are crucial for the current government to maintain a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable given that the EU illegally denies us access to funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
His party takes a more radical stance on the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary has undergone under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, sets "impossible conditions, because its goal is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "political dictate enforced by blackmail and attempts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states, not one ruled by the strongest and the Brussels bureaucracy that is not subject to democratic control.
He said that his party would never agree to such concessions from Brussels, which would result in the limitation of Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland being a colony," he said.
But to know your way around... In our Lidl store, there is one type of cheese available in four different locations.
I didn't look at other things, I encountered one yogurt more than once, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes of looking at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They did have it, it's true, but in that narrow sector all the selected, less common and special cheeses were on display, between the vegetable section and the lactose-free zone...
If I manage to avoid it, I won't even go near a supermarket, action or no action, the golden shop on the square may not have such a wide selection, but they usually have everything I need and it's all neatly arranged, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a holiday.
And I really don't care anymore.
I have been watching for two years how data is treated here like manure, most anti-vaccination opponents are only slightly more out of touch than most pro-vaccination supporters.
While a rational discussion does take place at the professional level, only extreme views make it into the public sphere.
Always from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.

Colourful pies instead of robust analyses.

Yuck, I was relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and have a nice day, everyone.
As a child, I was punished with a spoon.
It was never because of marks, it was usually just because I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehaved (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without a warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a hit (sometimes even after a second "catching" of the spoon, she would simply bring it and place it so that I could see it).
Only after repeatedly refusing to listen, I received a few slaps on the buttocks (through clothing).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable manner and degree) is beneficial, because children respond much more to it than to words.
I think the warning part is important, because it gives the child a sense of choice as to whether to obey or get punished.
In the end, I usually just needed a warning to start listening.
System defence
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document that is sworn to and taught in schools from an early age, or rather a treaty that can be changed if necessary - he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once we agreed in the constitution on democratic principles governing our lives, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, we should be more careful about making changes.
Imagine: some nations actually like their rules.
Just as the Czechs love dumplings with pork and sauerkraut, Vojtěch Cepl commented at the time on the question of whether or not to join the EU.
However, in recent times, the view among lawyers has become increasingly common that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be changed.
It has been tested by situations that its creators (to whom Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not foresee, such as the behavior of the directly elected president.
Cepl was right about one thing, however.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions into their text must be well thought out.
The institution must be understood and actively defended, otherwise it can be the key to overcoming most crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a sort of rule of governance consisting of individual rules that set boundaries for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we restrict policies with bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to abuse their power.
Covid doesn't discriminate; at FN Brno, a several-month-old baby is fighting for its life
Although it is known that the coronavirus is generally milder towards children, there are also severe cases that hospitals are struggling with, especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, with estimates ranging from 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Dr. Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesia and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University.
The course is usually much simpler, lighter, and often occurs without symptoms.
However, there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we can see especially in recent times," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, this involves dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at the clinic for childhood infectious diseases.
Only recently have very seriously ill children with the coronavirus been admitted to ARU.
Children with post-COVID syndromes were continuously admitted to the ward throughout the year, according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute COVID pneumonia, which means pneumonia requiring resuscitation, " he said, adding that this disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and several-month-old babies.
Children in serious condition due to the coronavirus are also present in hospitals.
"At the moment, we have a child of several months and adolescent age in our care," said the head physician.
However, he is happy that so far, no child deaths related to the coronavirus have been recorded at the FN Brno Children's Hospital.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominik, the psychologist is an indispensable part of the collaboration in the children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus ward - and plays a vital role.
It also points out the fact that, just as in adults, vaccination mitigates the course of the disease and also reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome in children.
"We therefore recommend vaccination doses for children as well," the doctor added.
In the rest area, you can only walk on marked paths.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere outside the quiet zone in national parks (but don't climb over the fence into the enclosure).
Skiing or cycling in the forest outside designated trails is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course, it is not really enforced outside of national parks).
How does a conductor train?
The music is running through my head, laughs Josef Kurfiřt.
He was nurtured by the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can perform practically the entire repertoire, and as a conductor he works not only at the Liberec F. X. Šaldy Theatre, but also, for example, at the Plzeň Theatre, at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He collaborates with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra, or the Podkrkonošský Symphonic Orchestra.
China gives the impression of controlled infection and that the authoritarian regime is better equipped to deal with the crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression of controlled infection and that the authoritarian regime is better equipped to deal with the crisis.
China has launched a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing deflected criticism for failing to contain the infection, which has since become a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero new infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus, for example, also in the worst-hit Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says, "Hey, do you want an elephant?"
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because it mows the grass, washes the car with its trunk, and the children play with it.
It's just great.
If you want, I'll sell you the elephant for 5000 Kč.
Friend: OK, I'll give it a go, it'll be great...
After some time, they meet up and the one who bought it complains: man, what a fool I was to buy it for that price????
The lawn is all trampled, there are giant turds everywhere, the car is smashed, the kids are scared of him, and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you talk badly about the elephant, you won't be able to sell it like that...
World events are controlled by superpowers.
Although sovereign states are equal, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become a great power if it works on its integration.
So far, it functions on the economic and political level (in selected areas), but there is still no military integration.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15, or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will work out.
I also thought of that and it is quite possible.
I am not an expert in Czech, so I may be wordy.
I am only basing my assumption on the fact that an ellipse usually includes two different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment, "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas in "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
Furthermore, I base this on the fact that the sentence says "all American forces," including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad definition and that it does not need to be further specified for American forces.
But again, just for the sake of wordplay :D
Either way, it's an absurd demand

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the capuchin monkey Milly
Terrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its callous owner flushed it down and mocked it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The magistrates court in Gwent has now permanently banned her from keeping animals, The Sun newspaper reported.
Experts in the rehabilitation of monkeys, who are caring for Milly after her abuse, have stated that they have never seen a monkey so terrified as Milly.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with Monkey World workers in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey called Moon again.
The four-time mother admitted to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Gwent Magistrates' Court, she was sentenced to a twelve-week prison sentence suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid labor, received a lifetime ban on animal keeping, and must pay court costs equivalent to 12,000 Czech crowns.
Steph Sawyer, the leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, said, "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue for some time."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still trigger panic in her.
Psychological scars from the abuse will stay with her forever, adds Sawyer.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage on her phone after a raid on her apartment in connection with drug charges.
On the footage, one can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
In another video, you can hear Holland offering the monkey cocaine and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she admitted, along with her partner Russell Cox (43), to possessing cocaine with the intent to sell it.
In her house, cocaine worth £1600 (approximately CZK 48,000) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently sentenced to 30 months in prison and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from the prehistoric era three times in a row, when you bravely skip over the entire 20th century?
So you take the same things with you to first year as you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing kills the idea of rote learning, where nobody, with the exception of a few, cares whether you can do it or understand it.
The main thing is to write a test for 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Run and ask people on the street at random if they can solve the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone has been through it, and the vast majority don't even flinch and tell you they don't give a shit.
So what the hell is she learning for?
I am a big fan of general knowledge and the fact is that people don't want and don't need it.
And at that moment, it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Partially, it is learned for the many people who will need to use that particular thing.
But, that note that you don't really need all this stuff when standing at the machine was absolutely serious... ...because you just don't need it.
Moreover, we are gradually entering a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which is probably also due to our communist past and the persecution of intellectuals and elites) However, the price we pay for having barbarians standing guard over those machines is simply too high.
If journalists were better at math, the COVID pandemic would probably never have reached these proportions.
A Wedding at First Sight: Kadri and Andrey's War Continues!
Which is the main reason why she cannot leave Switzerland immediately," Andrea answered on Instagram Stories to the inquisitive fans' persistent questions about what made her so disappointed with Kadri that she decided to cut off all contact and even block him on social media.
There was friction between Kadrim and Andrea from the start of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move there to be with him, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
However, she resolutely refused.
And as it turns out, their relationship did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was your planned attack! Kadri retorted angrily in response to Andrei's accusations of lies, gambling, and debts,
Kadri's alleged sincerity did not sit well with his ex-wife, nor with his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't really talk about such things at all, and in my family we never really talked about these things much either.
I certainly don't want to evoke any sympathy.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and defame someone I love so much, I just can't let it go!
I am sorry that I have to do this this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadir for having the character to help our family when we needed it most, even though he was so young.
All the more do I regret having to read such false information, which is probably quite out of context.
I would really like everyone to know Kadri as we do, our close friends and family, says Andrea in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him more than anything and know the truth and know what really happened, she added vaguely.
The drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe it for what reason.
Chao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he ultimately stole approximately 329 Czech crowns from one vehicle.
He then thought of nothing better than climbing up to the fifth floor and entering the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
In a shot from one security camera, he is seen walking away from the scene of the crime, eating a banana as he goes.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and he called the police.
Cchaa subsequently detained us.
The man admitted that he had consumed some alcohol on the day in question.
And given that he needed money, in a drunken state he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk man climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to the pandemic alert level.
If that is abolished, the law will not be effective.
The law does restrict the scope of business activities, however
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters turned out for the Saturday elections to the councils of four municipalities
On Saturday, people elected new councils in the communities of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Liberecko, and Rovná in Pelhřimovsko.
The number of representatives in these communities fell below the legally prescribed number or the elected councils disintegrated there.
A total of 28 seats were up for grabs on Saturday, with 99 candidates vying for them.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
The processing of the results of the Saturday elections symbolically closes a relatively challenging but successful year for us.
In total, four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place there, said Eva Krumpová, Deputy Chair of the Czech Statistical Office.
She reminded that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In Komňa in Uherské Hradiště, the Association of Independent Candidates won the Saturday elections, gaining 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means the gain of two mandates.
The Citizens for Komňa party also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of voters giving them their vote.
The former mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Soukromníci, also managed to get back into the council.
The Komňany, independent candidates, secured one seat on the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in Pelhřimov, the association Pro Rovnou won.
It received 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four seats out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were also elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia in Mostecko were again won by the Lusatia and Svinčice Association led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the votes and, just as in 2018, it has four seats in the seven-member council with the same number of seats.
The second place was taken by the Občané pro lidi candidate, which received 43.27 percent of the votes, and will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the urns.
In Nová Ves in Liberec, independent candidates from Nádeje pro Novou Ves won the elections ahead of ANO.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates, securing four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened its position compared to the regular elections in 2018, gaining more mandates and now has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the election results.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you already know all of this stuff that people are writing to you here.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to argue with.
If not, it's sad.
I am not saying that Christians are degenerates, not at all.
In fact, I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal, to look good).
And I really don't care what people believe in.
On the other hand, I dislike how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it amassed, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, such as the Thirty Years' War
TL;DR: Believe in the spaghetti monster if you like, but the state and the church have no business together
The man fell headfirst from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, who was attended to by the regional Health Emergency Service.
Employees of the regional emergency operations centre took an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday, with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two ambulance crews from the ZZS immediately responded to the scene, a medical and a paramedic crew.
Upon arrival at the scene, medical personnel discovered that the twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen out of a window from a height of around twelve meters and landed headfirst on the concrete!
In Vítkovice, coal caught fire.
But not as it should have been, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in imminent danger of death.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, secured artificial lung ventilation, and after further measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care at the Ostrava trauma center, informed the spokesman for the Moravian-Silesian Ambulance Service, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more concerned about inappropriate reactions from the public and authorities than about the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are at the forefront of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends belt
MMA had a great show full of interesting results.
At the UFC 269 tournament, things happened.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to defeat the legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had not been defeated for seven years.
Charles Oliveira had no trouble in the lightweight division, putting on a great chokehold against Dustin Poirier and defending the belt.
Kai Kara-France also recorded a victory, quickly knocking out Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that nobody expected.
This was brought by the women's bantamweight fight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the mutual battle as a "dwarf," Nunes having not lost a fight for seven years and eager for another victory.
The match started out in line with the paper predictions.
Nunes started her quest for victory very actively and even managed to knock her opponent down with a push kick.
Pénová, however, was not forced into making any further mistakes and herself unsuccessfully attempted to attack using a wrist grip.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents exchanged a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Pénová also knocked Nunes down to the ground, where she started strangling her.
She had to give up the effort and shake off the attack.
The American thus caused a huge shock to everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the fight between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier was doing better, but the cards gradually began to turn in favor of McGregor.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, attempting to subdue the opponent with an armbar.
Although he didn't do very well at first, he then created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on the back foot, and pounded him with a series of blows.
Thanks to this, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to shake off the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley recorded a dominant victory, knocking Raulian Paiva out with a hard right hook in the first round.
He then knocked him out with a series of well-aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth victory.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her small daughter, but now, seven years later, she has lost.
Is it the hip or the other hip?
At first glance, it doesn't seem to be anything complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine, or neuter.
However, there is also a relatively large group of nouns whose gender is not fixed, such as:
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
In the declension, they take on double endings and in some cases remain in the uninflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" or "kyčel" are of both masculine and feminine gender, and in the first case they are declined according to the pattern "stroj", and in the second according to the pattern "píseň".
In another group of nouns, the forms differ even in the first singular case, such as "row/rows", "cabbage/cabbages" or "potato/potatoes" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are, however, literary, have the same meaning, and are therefore interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, such as "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumbers" in Moravia, in this case, the Moravian variant is non-standard, and the same is true for other pairs of Czech-Moravian words: "ditch" and "ditches", "bun" and "buns" etc.
Some words that have entered Czech from other languages were originally uninflected, but gradually they have started to adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image," which is both of the masculine and feminine gender, or the word "buffet," which remains in the neuter gender in the middle case, but in the masculine has endings according to the pattern of "castle."
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation like directly at the Greek borders?
Tension prevails at the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to head to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them from doing so.
European politicians promise support to Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to embark on a perilous journey?
And what is the situation like on the ground?
For three months we haven't seen blue skies and we've been suffocating, says a journalist from Sydney
Devastating fires that Australia has been struggling with for the past four months have killed almost three dozen people and millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the people themselves coping with the disaster?
Could the government of Prime Minister Morrison have done more to prevent the drastic consequences, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in terms of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Sydney-based journalist Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been and remain quite rare.
That's why they always write about everyone everywhere.
People find it uncomfortable to address how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to sweep it under the rug.
I do not know anyone personally who was falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I have seen how their surroundings and even the police often treat them.
Victims should always be believed.
A trend has emerged where victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
However, a lot of people still keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations are made up" and that it's a "trend" only helps sexual predators.
Czechia is flooded with unfinished houses, families do not have the money to complete them
Construction materials prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people found themselves in a difficult situation as a result of this.
It does not have the resources to complete the unfinished family homes, and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also rising.
As a result, people do not have enough money to complete already partially built family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely uncomfortable situations.
In the best case scenario, people move into unfinished and unlicensed houses.
In the worst case scenario, the unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay off their mortgages and also rent, says Štěpán Křeček, an economist at BHS.
We build two to three family homes a year, and in fifty percent of cases this has happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to comply with certain things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we work without pay," said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of a construction company.
A lot of people are only going to start having financial problems.
If they expected the house to cost five million, now it will cost seven.
I think some will wait and see," added Slívaň.
Copper, iron, and also plumbing and heating equipment were the materials that increased in price the most.
Construction companies also struggle with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction-related fields, and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
The situation is only more favourable at the moment in terms of issuing building permits.
"In October, building authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than last year," Křeček clarified.
We are doing well and will do even better.
Real visions are missing, says Radiožurnál commentator
In addition to the traditional New Year celebrations, the entry into the new year has also traditionally been marked by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babiš, the nation was addressed by the President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, as well as the Speakers of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What significant things have we learned?
I think the thesis is great just like that, I have my own topic that I chose, I build on my bachelor's degree, and I work on it all year round, and then I write the written part in about a week to two weeks.
Exams are completely relaxed here, as long as you're not a total monkey and there's something left in your head, the commission won't unnecessarily torture you with theory.
I, for example, studied for a week before the final exam and when I was at my wit's end, the examination committee always tried to guide me towards some logical derivation, which I immediately understood and got right.
Otherwise, as for those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we did this a lot, it's really useful and you learn a lot), and then they just learn the project and they're done.
In my opinion, it's great when the end of the course is a test that incorporates knowledge gained through the project, rather than just a presentation.
Please do not overwhelm emails and phones with everything and do not send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be just as much of a jerk as they are.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with that.
And if they were against Russia, they would be taking a big risk, so they might have to play with them, otherwise something bad could happen to them.
But you can just as well put a similar statue of Putin next to the Pú bear statue.
Maybe give her another one so that she can kick Xi Jinping in the butt or something like that.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing a spanner in the works for artists.
If you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
Moreover, they keep changing what function is more important, whether it's likes, comments, or saves.
Lately, it's been really pissing me off, so I might have to resort to TikTok, where a lot of artists from my field are having a lot of success and people can't get enough of it.
In the end, I might even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that didn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists
Statement of the Donbas Working People's Party
The union - yes, the breakup - no, this is how opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion on the photo.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in the history of mankind occurred.
On December 8, 1991, in the Białowieża Forest, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the benevolent acquiescence of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, signed an agreement in secret, regardless of the people, that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With a single stroke of the pen, they "cancelled" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even without the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars combined!
Before that, the same people who, in one session in the Białowieża Forest, destroyed what had been built up over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, detached fourteen republics from the world's largest power, which had previously been economically connected into a single mechanism.
If we want to look deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the rise in crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all of this is the result of a geopolitical capitulation, the abandonment of the socialist camp first, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "vacuum of power."
Everything that was hastily betrayed and abandoned was quickly taken over and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken, mainly due to events from the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a high turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK per kg.
I'll buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain reduces its price to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - explain to me the mechanism by which the change in the price of the meat makes it a burden on my digestive system?
Or I can wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted by 69 CZK/kg, one day before the expiry date - how does this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left in my refrigerator for three days?
I will answer myself - by nothing.
These jokes about how if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled, or of poor quality are really retarded, to be honest ;-)
Recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass, a young lady was handing out some kind of brochure, I always take things like that to help the workers, they can't just throw them away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the workings of the world, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I guessed it was some kind of propaganda.
After finishing the book, I found out who published it and in the end it turned out to be Scientology.
Well, it was a good piece of advice, full of completely unnecessary lessons, like that I should wash and not be a bitch.
It's a shame about the paper, if it weren't for this, the rainforests wouldn't have to be cut down.
Something similar happened with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with that person because you love them, without realizing how much of a mess the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started crying and on her knees begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the doors.
Approximately a year ago, it was a great relationship, but then another half a year passed and she started to get on my nerves.
Then I ended that relationship by telling her that I was breaking up with her and lying to her that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and to prevent her from going on another rampage.
Such a person will suck the life out of you, draining your emotions and overall joy.
Better to keep your distance
When insurance companies are rapaciously buying up clouds of tests and hunting down the positives, who would otherwise not even know about this terrible disease, without the test.
The only thing we achieve is complications for companies, carriers, and others, because their employees in the random number generator got five days of house arrest.
In the west, they have already stopped with the nonsense and acknowledged that it is not worth worrying about a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and still has to steal something and boost his ego by inventing excuses.
I see that the old scam is back again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unethical business, MLM recruitment is once again on the rise.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it out (I was 20 years old, a freshman in university), and the initial promises of training in product knowledge and sales skills quickly turned into "it doesn't matter what you know, just get people to sign up."
Honestly, I was interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about scaring and persuading people.
When the first earned money came in, people quickly realized that in order to make a profit, they had to sell a few reliable products every month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only sources of income, so then one felt like a door-to-door pot salesman.
However, I can say that it was a valuable experience, and it taught me that one should not jump at every opportunity and that information should be thoroughly verified.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump them all together.
People can be successful and even helpful in this business, but they certainly won't be boasting about expensive consumer goods or "fat" bank accounts.
In the corporate environment where I work, I haven't experienced many such things.
HR is calm, managers are minding their own management, and they don't stick their noses into our business too much.
Regular assessment does happen, but it takes place in a different form than what we have in the Czech Republic (set some goals for the next year, and we'll see how you did after a year). It's more of a self-assessment than having someone assess you based on some numbers.
Optional company events are also available.
But we are also a bit unique within our company, as there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes it feels like we're a quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation, no.
But it works so that it doesn't bother us too much as long as the results are there.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police unsuccessfully searched for the missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that the woman from Uherskohradišť was found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
In consideration of the family, we will not be providing any further information about the case.
I offer my sincere condolences, Kulhánek wrote on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28th on a bus on her way home from work, she had just withdrawn money from an ATM before boarding.
Five days later, her colleagues at work reported her disappearance.
Immediately after that, the London police began searching for her, and Interpol listed her as a missing person worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police have already arrested one man in connection with this a few days ago.
It did not disclose what role he played in the case or what he is suspected of.
Four municipalities got new councils at the end of the year
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the communities of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Liberecko, and Rovná in Pelhřimovsko.
The number of representatives in these communities fell below the legally prescribed number or the elected councils disintegrated there.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates competed for 28 seats.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters cast their ballots.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the councils of the four mentioned municipalities.
36 women and 63 men competed for 28 parliamentary seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years old.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of the Saturday elections symbolically closes a relatively challenging but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place there.
We had to work under more difficult epidemiological conditions, which required more equipment and personnel, assessed Eva Krumpová, the First Deputy Chair of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last voting district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49 a.m.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the voting results, and once approved, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a fairly dangerous and infectious disease here at the beginning, but it went smoothly without any major obstacles.
Dealing with the fact that a large part of the population, at all levels, approaches it in such an idiotic way still poses a problem for me.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not complete idiots.
He would be stripped of the presidency and rendered ineligible to hold it again.
The chances that this will actually happen are, however, as others have mentioned, very small.
Moreover, I am not sure whether the declassification of the file could even be considered treason.
High treason is such an act by the president of the republic that threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are sexless for a whole year is on the rise
An increasing number of young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
It mainly concerns religiously-minded people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from a sexual life increased from eight to 21 percent between 2008 and 2021.
More women aged 18 to 35 are reporting that they have not had sexual intercourse in the last year than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
However, the presence of the media, social networks, or video games may also have contributed, as they make sex an increasingly lower priority for young people.
"Since 2010, the share of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they did not have sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly," said Lyman Stone, a researcher at IFS.
Among people in marriages, sexual activity is more frequent, with only 5% of them reporting in 2021 that they had gone without sex in the last year.
Among unmarried people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also contributed to by the fear of premarital sex and the religious makeup of the population.
Despite the fact that married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and engaged people under the age of 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided in their opinions about premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among the free-living individuals in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior is pushing this trend," says Stone about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is their religious background.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate among unmarried people younger than 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to nearly 60 percent.
Among the "less believing," the trend rose from 10 to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to a decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially less social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of having sex is lower among people who are unemployed or have lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, which serves as a substitute for this need.
This trend has become especially prevalent during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The whole mandating of vaccination against COVID is about whether a society should force a part of the population to engage in behavior that they do not want, but which may save their lives.
It is a fairly difficult question, and personally, I am most interested in the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether, if we don't order them to do it and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we certainly could have been responsible for the death of an eighty-year-old man who actually didn't know much, we didn't explain it to him very well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he couldn't be vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a hardcore anti-vaxxer who stands here alongside the SPD and KSČ shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be fairly inferred that most unvaccinated pensioners are probably in the second group, so they will indeed be able to blame themselves.
No snow in the Czech Republic.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter so far has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times in the Czech Republic.
Ski resort operators cannot do without artificial snow, and the weather can complicate even the preparations for the Jizerská 50 cross-country skiing event.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about a prankster.
Once in middle school, our teacher took us all the way across the city to the boathouse so that we could paddle boats on the river.
On the way there we walked along one fairly wide street and who do you think we saw in the middle of it - followers of the Hare Krišna sect.
Of course, they pounced on us.
Fortunately, I managed to escape, but one of my friends got into a conversation with him.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I have no soul," she replied.
We all laughed all the way, including the teacher, all the way to the boathouse.
We are terribly spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honors.
"We are opening a new chapter in our mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must jointly demonstrate that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
The crisis caused by worrying movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border is worth addressing through diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy group," which brings together France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine, the Chancellor said.
Morawiecki said he informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, as we record hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border every night.
He discussed further sanctions with the chancellor in order to finally make the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, assured that Warsaw can count on German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of Lukashenko's regime of refugees.
A drunk Polish nun caused an accident and tried to cover it up
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but it was driven by a different nun, who tried to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driving license for failing to give way in traffic and leaving the scene of an accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that she collided with another nun, who asked her for help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breathalyzer test and, after discovering that she had more than two promilles of alcohol in her blood, they immediately confiscated her driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she would be called to account for her actions in court.
Dog Hugo is doing what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not keep an eye on his film.
Czech creators of family comedies took inspiration from American stories about beloved pets.
However, they forgot about a crucial thing: the laws of the filmmaking trade.
After the kitschy film F. Brabec's Gump - The Dog That Taught People to Live, another film, Here We Keep Watch, is now vying for the audience's emotions in cinemas.
The scriptwriter and director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr., loosely follows up on his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
The talking hedgehog Hugo and some familiar characters around him are back on stage.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a dying pension in the Šumava region, start inviting dog owners, Julie's father with his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who is experiencing her first love.
The director, along with his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer), struggled with the narrative techniques in their previous dog film, but at least children and the dog provided some entertainment there.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of awe and embarrassment.
Let's summarize.
Julie, a scientist, falls prey to the superstitions of the dark ages when it comes to wanting a child, and if the "constellations" align, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever the coordinates dictate - on the car bonnet or the church tower (of course, during an ongoing tour with a local guide), Mojmír, a retired colonel, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie), who falls into a coma, and the family takes her to the hospital in the heart of the Bohemian wilderness, where a miraculous healing process takes place with the help of a dog.
Nothing against the healing power of nature and the strength of beloved animals.
Their owners know why they have them.
However, the viewer is amazed at the content mess of unbelievable situations and characters that was necessary to convey this message.
A pair of thieving staff members, a dog show competition, a Bohemian charlatan from the Šumava, police arriving on a tip to search for "drugs," and a family arguing over the medicinal properties of bone meal - and which, of course, the pension's staff will duly ply with alcohol.
When the heroine wakes up from a coma and immediately sits groomed and made up at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and flapjacks as a cured vegetarian, it's hard not to laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build a narrative structure, an understanding of the characters and their nuances, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are uneven, the editing is clumsy, and the overall impression is sloppy.
No matter how hard Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková, or Nela Boudová try to hold their parties together, they don't have much to play for.
The only positive aspect of the film is the poetic shots of the Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and the pair of ermines.
It is not enough to sketch out a few characters, a flimsy plot, and dog-related catchphrases, let alone more down-to-earth vulgarities that the characters commit.
Membership in the Dachshund Breeders' Club for a long time is not an argument either - as in the case of the producer lady.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between humans and dogs, there must also be knowledge of the trade, if one wants to tell a believable story.
In this case, it did not work out.
There is a bit too much erotica and a lack of sensitivity to the genre in this good family film.
Even as an advertisement for canisterapy, this amateurish piece would not have passed muster.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, and here you can see how much you know about that shit, but it's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer; if they don't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you had listened to those kids all the time, you might have changed your mind.
It's just like any other job, in this case a part-time job.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have observed at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of its long-term average rainfall for November.
The two-day rain this week was therefore more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It's also the perfect Christmas setting, Wasím Aškar from Nazareth rejoiced.
Rainfall in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, is sporadic and irregular.
Winter rainforests depend on rain.
Without them they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Galilee Lake, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters in a row.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water engineers have been warning about drought for a long time.
"It can be expected that depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall may decrease here," said Uri Schor, spokesperson for the Israeli Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weaker countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan fare worse.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, more tanker trucks are being added.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years," reported tanker truck driver Imád Sulejman in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes have broken out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The bed of the local river was completely devoid of water.
The region has experienced the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran
The Israeli Defense Minister stated that the talks in Vienna did not bring about "any progress" and that he informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is currently in the US, is trying to convince Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he has also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and that the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
About three years ago, this happened to me too.
I flirted a little with the lady and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she really wanted from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicion of a pyramid scheme was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I continued to badger the lady for a while with doubts and questions, and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a hooligan, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers headed to the mountains over the weekend, where they found plenty of snow and good weather
The mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of skiing enthusiasts this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow, and some ski resorts have therefore started operations.
The skiers were not deterred even by the requirement to show a COVID certificate at the lifts.
While ski lift operators are not complaining about the lack of customer interest, some ski equipment rental companies are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people headed out to run trails and ski slopes in the Liberec region over the weekend.
Skiers were blessed with weather that offered both sunshine and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really went well, starting with the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the mountain," praised the director of the Ještěd Sport Areal, Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people headed to the Jeseník Mountains for the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov or the center in Branná in Šumperk were open.
Weekend attendance was very good, on Saturday and today an estimated 400 people came.
The conditions are superb.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so it was perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branná, who was full of praise.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or within the timeframe after recovering from the COVID-19 disease.
With the exception of a few cases, people are prepared for this and present the necessary documents, said René Hroneš of the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre to ČTK.
"We only recorded a few incidents," he added.
Some ski rental and retail outlets report lower demand than before the pandemic.
Thankfully, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Ostrava Skiopava store.
A greater influx is expected during skiing courses.
The director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, David Šinták, also feels that due to COVID, there is less interest in renting ski equipment than before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost fully booked.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are at about 50 percent, said Šinták to ČTK.
He said that people have become lazy during the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental company in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is experiencing a great demand.
They started renting skis there last week, and now interested parties have to book them in advance.
"We start renting skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the facility.
According to her, interest in ski schools is also comparable to the pre-epidemic period.
If we want successful and wealthy people to stay in the country, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life here, just as they would in a foreign country.
That certainly doesn't include socialist healthcare, where it is often difficult to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people leave the country, without any assets, to go abroad.
The owner of the company is not going to just up and leave for a foreign country.
I agree with the rest completely.
If these people do not feel that they can have a good life in the Czech Republic, and if they do not see a reasonable future for themselves in the Czech Republic, then they will not live here.
Emigration from Hungary began like this: one beautiful day, Orbán won, he ruled for a year, and suddenly emigration rose by a few tens of thousands per year.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar situation overnight.
Another question is the elections.
If things go badly here, there is a chance that some traditional V4 nutcase could win.
The young and educated will leave, leaving behind his supporters and people whose wealth cannot be stuffed into an airplane.
Terrifying photo!
Langmajer with blood on his hands because of a bet on beer?
While in the Czech Republic autumn was in full swing, the crew of the film Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor, meanwhile, published a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it just for the sake of filming?
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on the way home.
"Petra's disappearance doesn't at all resemble her behaviour and we are starting to get very worried about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the Lambeth police district, where Srncová worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic also has great concerns about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman, according to her, left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last seen reportedly on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on December 3.
According to British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant nurse" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Trust, in the role of a "nurse assistant" in the children's ward.
"We have immense concerns for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of healthcare facilities tweeted.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
The public is also urged to cooperate by MP Harriet Harman, who on Saturday drew attention to the Srncová case at a press conference.
"She has been missing for several days now, she is only 32 years old, and she is from the Czech Republic. Her parents are understandably distraught," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel like we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her, because she was away from her native country, away from her family, and working here for our healthcare system," Harman said.
The police have previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, the BBC news website reports that the police did not provide any information about his identity or the reason he is suspected.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like that either.
That is not "huge numbers," but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of an invasion and that they are getting tired of our presence.
I quoted up there.
I don't know what made him conclude that Russia wants war.
War is hell of an expensive joke and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is so different in so many ways that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily: D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all there is to it, and that's how the "concentration" at the borders would make sense.
After all, pacts are meant to be kept...
In Prague, new timetables come into effect on Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections
Passengers in the Prague integrated transport system (PID) can expect several changes from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed their routes, and others have disappeared.
The Mladoboleslavsko region is now joining the integrated system.
From Sunday, fast trains from České Budějovice will stop at the Zahradní Město station in the capital.
In suburban rail transport, trains of the S7 line will depart, which travel through Prague's main station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The recently opened station Prague-Zahradní Město will now be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will now expand into other areas.
Among other things, buses will go as far as Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy, and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladoboleslavsko region, including lines extending into the Liberec and Královéhradecký regions, will be integrated.
During the integration, 77 lines will be abolished, 37 new ones introduced, and the operation of 12 existing ones will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín and go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník has also been established, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
The connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened during the morning rush hour and on weekends, with the introduction of the new express line number 404.
The PID system now includes lines 400 and 410 that run to the Liberec Region.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
The backbone line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubou, and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor, and selected services continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Line 410, a supplementary line, runs through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoň, and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, the operation of a number of local tracks in the Central Bohemian region has been cancelled or restricted, including to Mochov, Dobříš, and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the railway modernization, there are long-term restrictions on the tracks from Prague to Beroun, Prague to Lysá nad Labem, and around Kolín.
Passengers can also expect changes at other locations.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or extend the section of line 420 from Dobříš with a connection to Prague, where PID tickets can be used all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed, and the routes of some buses in the border area between the Central Bohemian Region and Hořovicko in the Plzeň Region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack/lunch from the supermarket for the office
Hi, I work a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only option for getting food is to go across the street to Billy or a bit further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, after work I don't have the strength to exercise, so I have to eat as healthily and dietarily as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I can only buy things in a hurry, such as pizza dough and for a snack, yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy food that doesn't require cooking would you recommend that I buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a meter of snow like you do, unfortunately.
And it's not about trees that you absolutely have to see.
Only the tip of the tree can be hidden under the snow.
If it is damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I am not saying that this is the only reason why they prohibit us from driving off-piste, but it is one of them.
Dara's admission about her relationship with Nedved: I didn't look forward to this at all
The Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing but revelations about the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd since Friday.
They've been together since the summer, and the famous footballer even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to fans, explaining why she hid her love from them for half a year.
"I dare say that at the moment there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who doesn't know that Dara caught a bear, sorry, I mean Nedvěd, the most successful Czech footballer," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
However, he apparently dumped her, not the other way around.
Three days are in the spotlight, and although they are used to public interest, they do not enjoy it.
And here it is.
That which we both dreaded but knew would happen eventually, continues the singer.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's those who don't care at all and it pops up on them even from a can, or us, whose lives are dissected in detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your husband or wife are compatible, or insisted that everyone really knew in detail your list of ex-partners and was aware of your mistakes and failings.
That's just great, you want that, Dara says.
The couple met in Italy, where Rolins was going to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd is also long-term vice president of the football club Juventus.
They only came clean now, because they were waiting for the completion of Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years already, but they have only been legally divorced for three weeks.
In any case, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man and, just as he stands by me, I stand by him, in good times and bad, concluded Rolins.
Hi, other commenters have probably already said everything important, but I just want to confirm that the halls are great for the beginning, my fellow students usually get to know each other and become friends during the first semester or two, and then they find shared accommodation together, which I think is the best option because you know who you'll be living with.
Apartments are usually advertised for a relatively short period of time in advance, so there's probably not much available now, but it doesn't hurt to take a look at the offerings.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc. are a bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit like a ghetto.
On the other hand, Veveří district is very student-friendly, Královo pole is nice in that direction, and it's close to most of the VUT faculties (I don't know exactly which one you're going to).
I have never looked for a flat, but I am a native Brno resident, so I can perhaps advise you on Brno itself if you need any more information :)
That's a perfect example of completely "normal" thinking, though.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland decided to do, it's actually perfectly fine that the state doesn't adequately fund some schools.
Either they should learn what they want and pay for it themselves, or they should follow the state curriculum and let the state pay for it.
We certainly cannot allow a private actor to take over a piece of the education system just because they throw in a few cents to make up for the full state contribution, allowing them to teach whatever they want in schools.
Such a claim loses some of its weight when it is made by someone who, just two days earlier, expressed himself in this way about a petition calling for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against abortion is the same as a vote against a statue standing in the square for you?
I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job about the apartment with you.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitization that (and this even applies to long-term professionals) they either get it more or less right, or they write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would not really recommend it.
Personally, I would deal with this by adding a note depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a conscientious and hardworking student, you can look into some sign language databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from some book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol that fits what is physically on the coin.
Is it not rather the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) rather than the Odrynian?
PSS: Someone has already chewed this up for you here.
Check out that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That is a much worse disaster than the fact that they will have interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something just because nobody understood some text is laughable.
All important documents undergoing approval are scrutinized word for word, and for that basic knowledge of English is not enough, that's the job of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, and English is more useful for politicians in informal settings, for establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, with that English, it's quite interesting now that GB has left the EU.
I don't understand the hate for Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and it's all good.
I often drive home from work as late as 10 p.m. and never have any problems.
Only someone who has hardly ever set foot there can say that it's a ghetto.
Yes, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but all they do is block the pavement and park where they shouldn't :D I certainly wouldn't feel safe going out at night in that area.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the centre, I'd go for it.
Many apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda or Gelová as a stake in the fence!
Who will they spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen Dáda's wreath and Lucie must have one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda remained alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met up with Anička, Felix, and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we still talked to each other, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts throughout the year, and I'll definitely buy something for Dáda and Lucija, probably a perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the music video premiere at Richman club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to chat with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet Adrian, the wife of Ludek Sobota, or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it very clear.
And we are Iceland, so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us on our behalf, and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that should be a bad argument, so please explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals during a crisis.
There are too few police officers and they can't afford it, so it's the firefighters who do it, and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at that level.
The fact that our army is only capable of defending just Ostrava is a head-scratcher for previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is currently experiencing the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water levels have decreased in mountainous and subalpine areas, and even places that were not previously short of water are now recording lower precipitation amounts.
The cause of the drought that prevails in a large part of central Europe is climate change.
However, the effects are also exacerbated by the way we manage the soil.
What should we prepare for in terms of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it's going to be like that, I can barely stay on my skates on the ice, I know nothing about playing hockey, and the tactics (which I tried out in Franchise Hockey Manager) are generally all over the place.
Whether you're the hockey team "Bear Russia" or the "Llama China," losing by two goals even though you don't have to win the game is different than when it's tied.
But regardless, whatever I hear Czech commentators say, pointing out what referees notice and don't notice in either men's or women's hockey, it's all very strange, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And in my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be like always, and that the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5,766 persons are hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, and another 74.
In the Czech Republic, the number of confirmed cases in the last 14 days is 1967 per 100,000, and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered cases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, which is the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" big wave of infections caused by the Omicron variant, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK Health Security Agency, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already being hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to grow.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
On Sunday, Keir Starmer, head of the British Labour Party, stated that Boris Johnson probably broke the law by holding a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister in Johnson's government defended the quiz as having taken place "virtually," via a computer.
However, groups of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street took part in it.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from the post of Prime Minister.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous raves despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are outraged that Johnson and his government made a mockery of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial television ITV for the UK: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of Prime Minister.
It's remarkable how quickly events have developed.
Do you want to turn things around and save your skin?
Hungary is expecting spring elections that could end Viktor Orbán's twelve-year rule.
They will be elections of European significance.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because they were not free even in the last two elections under Orbán.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit itself, and engages in other smaller or larger tricks.
The latest one states that everyone can practically choose where they want to live.
This will allow Fidesz to bus voters from districts where the outcome is certain to those where the result is uncertain and where the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is quite different.
Before, it was about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is a big change for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they try even harder to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, leaked to independent media, in which he tells the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Those are the hints of a new approach that you are referring to?
Yes, that is one of the new features.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, the last time when I was 14, my mother doesn't have much patience, neither do I, but my dad has been patient for a long time, then he explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I used to get very angry, to the extent that I would lie on the floor in convulsions and turn blue, so they probably took me under the shower about 2 times to calm me down.
Sometimes they scolded me, but sometimes it was more that they didn't know what to do anymore.
I definitely have a tendency now to solve things violently, as a child I fought quite a bit, and now I at least hit things to get it out of my system, and as a younger child I would sometimes hit my parents on the hand, for example (to avoid getting a spanking), so nothing extreme, but the urge is always there.
I am not able to determine to what extent this is due to my explosiveness, but certainly the upbringing also plays a role.
I'm afraid I'll also lose patience with my own children and deal with it the same way.
I think hitting children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that point when it wasn't "educational" but out of frustration, on the other hand, every parent messes up sometimes, so I don't hold it against them. It's probably impossible to not tarnish your children at least a little bit.
It doesn't bother me in any way, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call Kundami those who create laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I would be interested to know if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product, and that you will have enough to pay off your mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak take Slovakia?
In Slovakia, the main trial in the case of the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It stirred up civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočner and his ties to the Slovak political and judicial elite.
How significant a breakthrough will the process be for Slovakia?
The media are to blame for this huge mess.
How is it possible that this petition received orders of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition by the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they got carried away and the company got off the hook.
Before half a year ago, people were dying of COVID on Czech television.
Another government is ending and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a storage site is nowhere to be found
The proposal by Minister Karel Havlíček needs to be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end, and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of communities and their citizens in the selection and approval of a deep geological repository for high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Government Legislative Council suspended the consideration of a proposal that the Ministry of Industry and Trade had finally submitted to the government after years of delays.
Its content, however, is in serious conflict not only with the affected communities united in the Platform Against Deep Geological Repository, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The self-governments expect a much stronger empowerment of their decision-making powers regarding the disposal site, as promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is also required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European directive.
We expect the new government to amend the proposal in accordance with its coalition agreement, in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law proposed by Minister Karel Havlíček, which Platform has access to, is criticized by municipalities, in particular, for the following: The proposed level of community and public involvement in the decision-making process for selecting a site for a repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if the communities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a particular location.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Storage Facility Authority to obtain the consent of the affected municipalities before commencing a specific proceeding.
The proposed draft of the material plan almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens of the communities little more than mere statistics in the approval process.
The proposal lacks a systemic compensation scheme for municipalities throughout the entire process of searching for and selecting a site, obtaining approval, and operating it.
Local authorities in reality have very few options under today's legal norms to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a site for a storage facility.
Only in certain permit proceedings can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or minister whose interest it is to issue the permit.
Any potential lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the carrying out of exploration or construction work.
The co-decision-making of local authorities that the Platform advocates is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in permitting storage facilities, such as Sweden and Finland.
The drafting of the law is also another failure of state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which SÚRAO signed and which is linked to contracts with attorney Jan Zemánek.
The total sum for these works, according to the contract register, is almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, the deputy mayor of the Cejle municipality from the Hrádek locality, and a spokesperson for the Platform Against Deep Geological Repository for Highly Radioactive Waste, said: "After ministers of industry who only postponed the empowerment of local authorities vis-à-vis state agencies in the search for a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors, we are expecting a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Municipalities and Towns for their support, which views the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a major project in a similar way to the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The platform against deep geological storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) for the purpose of promoting a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep geological storage.
The platform also advocates that the decision on the location for possible storage should be conditional on prior consent from the affected communities.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, doctors eventually scared him into doing so.
They told him that if he doesn't lose weight, he will die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun newspaper.
He showed off his new character at the Los Angeles premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body caused furniture to break.
"I stuffed everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview for AARP.
This time, I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm at an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, said Goodman to ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss you are and what you want to use the word "boss" for.
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, for example, a formal text such as a university essay, I would probably look for ways to describe or explain the boss more.
To top it all off, there are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls has several bosses, right? So, "boss" is like the lord / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that are not at all necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where bosses exist, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called bosses?
And then there are mini bosses.
It's hard to translate the word boss in a one-word phrase pragmatically, and Czech and other languages don't really have a solution to this (interesting is, for example, Catalan, which translates boss as the final opponent).
It is simply a significant part of the story or game in general, a computer-controlled opponent that is stronger than all previous ones, and that guards the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police also got involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko has been missing since December 7.
It also helps the British police through Interpol.
Petra Srnčová, a Czech citizen, was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
The whole world is now looking for Petra.
"The Czech police cooperate closely with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information about the case," she added.
The search for Petra, which has been widely publicized, has also appeared on the police website.
He says she is 168 centimeters tall, is thin, has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from the Uherský Brod area.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, as such a disappearance is very unusual for her
The local MP Harriet Harman also got involved in the search for Petra.
She participated in hanging posters with Petra's face.
"We have huge concerns about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
However, it is unclear who this person is and what he had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czechia is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October indicated a slight decrease in attack campaigns, last month, with the end of the year approaching, attacks significantly intensified.
We recorded a major campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in an email attempts to attract the user's attention by the name, which refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its name, this time it was labelled as "Copy of 11.2021...exe Accounting Corrections," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex e-mail clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last major campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the end of August and beginning of September, and as the holidays and the end of the year approach, the activity of the attackers is once again on the rise.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, in this case, the attackers are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists captured more global campaigns in November.
Compared to the October Formbook data, it slightly weakened in November, but still accounts for nearly half of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the entire month, with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th, and 15th of November.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the term receipt still appears as well.
A document in Czech can then be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decline and a slowdown in activity in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks, and had not carried out any major attack campaigns in the Czech Republic for several months.
Today's demo by the smart-alecks who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The parade in Prague was larger than the media reports suggest.
Based on the footage of the parade along the waterfront and my experience with the demonstrators, I estimate that there were around 10,000 people. I don't feel afraid.
People in the parade filled the quayside and the bridge as well as the opposite waterfront road.
That means there are a lot of people, really.
About four thousand demonstrators are joined spontaneously by an unprecedented number of passersby to the march.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led to them finding common ground.
Only the antivaxers, antimaskers, and co. alone could not have filled or paid for such a large parade.
The activities of the Chcípl pes association are becoming increasingly popular, reminding me of the Million Moments for Democracy movement in reverse.
Sometimes it seems to me that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what movement could be coaxed out of this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the amount of money available, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four- or more-dose vaccine.
It certainly won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, bet on it.
The three-dose vaccine is almost certainly going to become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is clear that we will have to get re-vaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists that humanity is rightly proud of.
End of the road, Bulgaria has a new prime minister calling for change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement There Is Such a People, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
He has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition, which is expected to take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
The winning parties that proclaimed a fight against corruption and abuse of power, however, failed to agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
From "secretly" filmed footage, it has become a global hit.
Over the weekend, concerns were growing in Britain about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, whom the London police have been searching for for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago, when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, information about the hospital employee is also being called in by her former employer and a Member of Parliament representing the London constituency where she lived.
"Petra's disappearance doesn't at all resemble her behaviour and we are starting to get very worried about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the Lambeth police district, where Srncová worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic also has great concerns about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman, according to her, left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last seen reportedly on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on December 3.
According to British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant nurse" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Trust, in the role of a "nurse assistant" in the children's ward.
"We have immense concerns for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of healthcare facilities tweeted.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
The amateur painter of children's bedrooms from Šumperk, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional Pirate councillor), was reported anonymously for violating copyright laws with her paintings.
However, the court recognized that Krteček's paintings in the Šumperk bedrooms do not violate the law.
For a month, a hole in the road in Ústí nad Labem took the form of a channel without a cover.
It was a matter of life and death.
The city council referred complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which owns the roads, and since it did not respond, the pothole remained.
Eventually, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the ŘSD "began to address the situation intensively".
