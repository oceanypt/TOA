The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the goods value....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer, so it's no problem for me.
I simply need a number or instruction as to what I should include with the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
Honestly, I find this quite annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price, or is there another way to get the credit?
I also think in general that it is not fair to ask children to take on the role of a parent for their younger siblings.
However, I think it's also good for older siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, help out for a bit, bring the bottle, etc.
This way, they learn responsibility, help out at home, and are involved.
As long as they are still young enough to play by themselves, I don't see a problem with that.
If your K1 is occupied for a short time alone and it's okay for him, that's fine.
You can best judge for yourself whether this is suitable for your children.
It's not as if he's supposed to wrap K2 up and accompany him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is also the psychologist's statement.
Because if something actually did happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller novel a few years ago, and although I can still remember almost the entire plot, the title escapes me completely. Perhaps someone here knows it?
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself in food and going into his enclosure with his carnivorous animals.
The case is taken over by a female detective who, after a short investigation, ends up at the therapist's clinic where he treats anxious patients, who runs the clinic.
The detective has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before every suicide to go to the site of the suicide and document it, and then post the photos online.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where the patients have a chip implanted in their brain that suppresses an anxiety center and ultimately forces the patients to face their fears in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to death deliberately)
This confronting of fear is referred to in the book as "the fight."
At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital that had something to do with a fire.
That's more or less the plot, and I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author / authoress.
If anyone knows about this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh dear, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available.
I have to contact my husband first.
But it can take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded back to you?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
A four-year-old child has wood splinters under the thumbnail (outer side) for the entire length.
They tried to pull him out with a pinching forceps.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try to do it.
No chance anymore.
Tomorrow we're going to the doctor.

Due to Omicron: Johnson wants to push through booster vaccination
New Omicron cases are constantly emerging in the UK, keeping politics and science on their toes.
Therefore, by New Year's Eve, all eligible adults in England should receive an offer of vaccination.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress than previously planned in the booster vaccination campaign against the coronavirus in the face of rapidly rising Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
The target date was previously the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
We are facing an emergency situation with the Omicron variant, so it is urgent that the vaccine protection must be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the protection level can be raised again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Get boosted now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, another 1,239 Omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price at pickup?
I am for everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent in an application.
Today, an invitation to a meeting was sent by email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter," but a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled it and depending on whether he/she has a cultural background from there, it's either a man or a woman.
** I have no idea how I'm supposed to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any officials' toes either.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them are leaving.
Only the one that I bought today doesn't work
Apparently, the chair had an undetectable defect at the time of sale.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Only tried it on the #PRS_ORG#.
This has been working for about ...
Not anymore for 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8, but...
However, there were no more.
They are now available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for them.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I will be writing in some detail here about domestic violence.
I just need to write something down to get it off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons quite often.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs all too often is that many victims refuse help or think that we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from that environment.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, and sometimes I am very close to tears myself, is that everyone deserves to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier, though.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series like for "League of Legends"?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Johannes Patrick, the youngster, was reliable.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said in reference to the cup defeat at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October: "We still have some anger in our bellies."
However, it did not settle down after the game - it increased even further in light of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
More than the bare result, the way the performance was carried out disappointed.
As an example, a statistic can be mentioned that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-pointer rate was a mere 13 percent, with four shots (all by the young Johannes Patrick) out of a total of 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory in Tenerife, and did not implement what we had trained for."
That is, to move the ball.
His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, reacted quite differently: "It's a great feeling to win the game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like in front of 10,000 people."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed into the Hohenlohe Arena, but they made the most of it.
Not least also because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team's game.
"The best playmaker I have ever trained," Gleim added, praising him.
While Patrick's team itself saw its top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) fail across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and managed to close the gap to eight points, after they had already trailed 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for deliberation.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm), the giants will host the Skyliners from Frankfurt, and then at most 750 spectators will be allowed in Ludwigsburg.
we used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I contacted them a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have sought legal advice again and have therefore written to them again for this reason.
We originally contacted them half a year ago.
Always smooth as silk: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform at all.
In fact, Max Raabe was supposed to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on the instructions of the authorities" to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Other of his scheduled performances during the Advent season will also have to be postponed for the time being, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists then want to make up for the concerts they had to postpone in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot and often as a young man.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of schlager and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the MTV Unplugged series (2019) reached the same second place in the charts as his successful album Für Frauen ist das kein Problem (2013).
He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with her blonde hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is now an indispensable part of the current German-speaking music scene.
Since 2020, he has been on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck," dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be complemented with existing furniture and we could check beforehand whether it matches in terms of color
It still doesn't work, and I can only lament the cover but not turn the pages.
Federal Housing Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing conglomerates, as demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
"With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies is actually the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens, and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission to decide how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out further tightening of the rental law in talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent cap until 2029, a limitation on rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak to the Justice Minister to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax anyway, "we will talk with our coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician emphasized.
Hello, I wanted to order something and a few days later I realized that I had forgotten the last step in the payment process.

At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has spawned numerous tornadoes across the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 fatalities to lament.
The images from there remind one of a war zone.
In the night from Friday to Saturday, several tornadoes in the US caused heavy destruction and possibly claimed up to a hundred victims.
The storms leave a roughly 320-kilometer-long trail of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants and roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates that up to a hundred people may have died in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that they are sold out of Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very unfortunate.
Is it still produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
Until when do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I now order the ceiling and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I returned an item via the contact form or requested a return and wanted to check whether it was received or processed, as I haven't received any confirmation yet.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees financial incentives for getting vaccinated.
They are in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - following the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
He switched to a company he badmouthed.
This does not make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It was a year ago.
He obviously didn't stick to his old position either and went looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, who cares?
He didn't think his job was very good either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I take a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Hello, Boron!
I am currently running an adventure called Over the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign specially written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts devised, and now I'm writing the introductory adventure and I'm already tripping over my own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to deliver a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
The further action is supposed to take place there.
Some miles from the village, the heroes are supposed to be ambushed by a group of goblins, who lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuade, act, threaten, recognize the danger early on, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords
If not noticed, the goblins lurk in a ditch and ambush the heroes from either side with three on each side armed with bows flanking the wagon, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If the battle ensues and the heroes lose, I have two solutions
1. All the heroes fall unconscious and are then found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is, of course, gone.
2. If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf with two of his servants intervenes and comes to the hero's aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything's fine.
How do you feel about the Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much of a starting point for the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take on board many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would still like to send them back
If you can then have the receipts sent back, I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am fed up with Sky Sport F1
Hello, dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality of German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I want to vent a bit with this post.
First of all, the F2 race broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the race today to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the start accident put the schedule far behind the plan, they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, legally F1 takes precedence, so everything else has to be restricted, which is why Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Nevertheless, it was still dumb, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes did a good job of accompanying the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident.
Then, in F1, there was once again a lack of knowledge of the rules among commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tires when there were corresponding radio messages about the topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was an option for Verstappen.
I think that such basic rules should be known simply if you comment on F1 at a pay-TV channel.
It's also not the first time that there has been speculation about what is now possible or required according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties about the subject of rules.
In general, I don't like Roos's affected commentary style, but I have to admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I actually like Heiko Wasser from RTL more seriously.
On top of that, there are constant gaffes that simply make both of them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
In particular, the latter brings a lot of chaos to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the final round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as one can hear at F1TV, where the German audio track without commentary is all that is needed immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
These two channels also make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as free-to-air broadcasters.
While I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programming is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster of F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the advertisements.
Thus, the grandiose F1 season is much less enjoyable than it could be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to know your opinion on this.
This one: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice so far and haven't received anything.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email, and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them already showed a defect after relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for help.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using an air pump.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can compare the services.
If the pumps are powerful enough, they can be used to operate entire facilities.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two, or four outputs, depending on the model, but a fan pump can also be used to add an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (available in our shop) or a decor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here, one could mention a treasure chest, shell, or similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction that results in low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or the like via an air hose with a diameter of 4/6 mm... and then it's ready to go.
The fan pump should be at the same level, or higher than the water level and mounted externally.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed between it and the water level.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent it from happening if water ever flowed backward, which would cause water from the pool to flow through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even though we list the processing time as 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily.
If everything goes well on the road, it goes very fast.
We just want to take a little precaution so that no one gets upset just because it took a little longer once.
It's like that, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in the logistics sector...of course, Corona doesn't stop here either.
Please do not rate it badly just because the delivery is delayed, that is exclusively due to the courier services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though right now we say...they have it damn hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Be angry at no one, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can one also order legs in light colours here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and host into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers have taken a short trip into outer space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the roughly ten-minute flight took place in the western part of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly crowned astronauts back upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were underway for ten minutes and thirteen seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers during the flight.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were the company's honorary guests; the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each of them paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley reflected on her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She was simply just along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Even Michael Strahan was enthusiastic.
He would prefer to go back to space right away, the host said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely autonomously.
The capsule that was detached from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, with intermittent weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned flight to space by Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in Star Trek, was there, as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of largely pursuing the business of space tourism without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate, pushing it forward without regard for the consequences.
With a single button press, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in a single color or cycle through its entire color palette.
When set to colour change, the light stone retains the light colour for about one minute before gently switching to the next decorative colour.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light is proven to withstand all weather conditions year-round outdoors.
In snowy conditions, its light is particularly effective - only a shorter light duration can be expected once the days get shorter.
Please note in winter that snow should not impair the function of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon (AA) format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry
I am currently in the first semester of biochemistry and I actually find the subject quite interesting in itself, and I don't mind working in the lab (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
Of course, I also researched career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also still thought that I would definitely want to study until I got my doctorate.
However, at the moment I have doubts, and the job prospects in particular are particularly depressing.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.), one hears constantly about great career opportunities and that the profession is highly sought after, while on the other hand one hears constantly about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
So I would really like to know:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What did you study/ What training did you receive?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and am considering possibly dropping out of my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship to become a specialist computer scientist.
If you have any experience with that, feel free to share it too :)
Extra stress before holidays and weekends with holidays
This topic came up for me last week.
However, I had to use my long weekend now to relax from that.
That's why we're only adding a post now.
Not only during big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
It seems there is also available during holidays and bridge days.
It was actually like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which we call "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-official.
Last week, therefore, a long four-day weekend was on the cards.
What happened last week then?
Stress everywhere.
There were so many emails that absolutely had to go out before Ascension, one order after another, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Well... yes, well?
Because "next week then" sounds so long after so much time has passed, and that's not allowed?
Or because people really want to achieve as much in a shortened week as they would in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed.
What is this self-imposed captivity for holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent in their approach.
My question is simply: Are we alone in this, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or is this also the case in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't even bought any presents yet.
"The nice thing is, even if there's no snow in Erfurt, you can just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer for Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the holiday spirit by baking and crafting with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
But until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "I haven't bought any presents yet, so I have to get started now for the first time."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth transition during the molt and the formation of new feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage in bird keeping is exclusively due to dietary errors.
Since the plumage is composed of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functional metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the molt are due to insufficient or imbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate vitamin and mineral supply.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable amino acid ratio in most plant-based feedstuffs is specifically taken into account and balanced out.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble in cold water and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR handicraft model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and central Germany, it is a very rare locomotive, probably from the conversion proposal in the ME model railroad magazine issue 11/1968, used with play marks and missing parts, see photos, the function is good, the E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly also from the small-series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to operational condition
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn Company commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that was to be capable of transporting 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h along this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, the DRG determined in March 1926 that the delivery would be as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a Tatzlager drive by AEG, with the mechanical part delivered by Siemens-Schuckertwerke and the electrical part by AEG.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and later found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were delivered as reparations goods to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Reichsbahn Repair Works in Dessau, the reparability of all six locomotives was confirmed.
[4] As the electrification of the Mitteldeutsche network progressed, a growing need for locomotives for the heavy freight service emerged, and in 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, while the remaining machines served as spare parts suppliers.
First, the E 04, E 44, and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were given priority for construction.
Only when it became apparent that the recovery rate of the E 94 could not be further increased, the E 95 came into focus for recovery efforts.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway maintenance depot.
They came to Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own circuit plan on coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig, and Erfurt.
As people got older, the complicated controls on the locomotives proved problematic.
This often resulted in shooters getting stuck in the switches during operations.
Then, the permanent attendant on this locomotive had to use a hammer and wooden wedge to release the valves during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months-long outages in the locomotive.
[5] By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new mainline locomotives available, and there was no plan for a significant expansion of the electrified network at that time, so the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most branch lines, leading to the E 95 being withdrawn from service.
In addition, they had the problem that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to staff their electric locomotives with only one man, which would have been a problem in train operations due to the difficulties with the machines and visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were put out of service in mid-1969, the E 95 01 was the last to follow, quitting service on October 5, 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
All locomotives except the E 95 02 were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at Halle main station.
It took some time for the decision-makers at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completely completed internally.
The locomotive is museum-maintained at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Arnstadt Museum-Bw with a new inner and outer paint job. The transformers were inspected and five traction motors are operational.
- The locomotives were in service on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved their reliability and low maintenance costs in operation.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the central German network.
The main area of deployment was initially Silesia
Model H0 handicraft locomotive in original packaging, in good working order, some optical repairs to the locomotive are required in your own workshop, dusty, with signs of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small production run - possibly from the small-series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle bar is held by two feet...unfortunately, these are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't put the bed together.
The central beam is supported by two feet, unfortunately these are produced with a defect.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When are they sent out?
no, no flat ones.
These are the right ones from the shape, they were just too narrow, according to the assembly instructions
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they fulfill their purpose
Mine are not flat
Could I get these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro range was caused, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation, according to the information.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck Kriminalpolizei has taken over the further investigations.
But that comes much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To dispel fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Up until now, Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now, the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his COVID-19 vaccination.
The illness of a friend inspired him, Şahin said.
Uğur Şahin, the CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false rumors on social media that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated in order to counteract these false rumors.
So far, he has declined it because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further.
He did not ask about the reasons.
The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Fear is difficult to combat with facts; sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle circulates in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"Legally, I am not currently allowed to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
There is prioritization in Germany for the administration of the vaccine.
Prioritization has long since been lifted - and the Biontech CEO has reportedly had himself vaccinated three times.
Fire in transformer station: tens of thousands of people without power
On Friday evening, several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia were plunged into darkness: there was no more electricity, and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had disabled a transformer station.
After a fire with serious damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several communities due to the fire.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption was finally completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers from the THW provided assistance in the communities.
Authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The supplier thanked the affected parties for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology Department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will take several days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to temporarily reconnect some lines, explained he.
A technical defect, according to company reports, caused the fire.
Power is back on
The fire that broke out on Friday around 7:15 p.m. is said to have severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid transformer station, according to Westnetz.
There are extensive cleaning and repair work to be done there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
Thanks to this bypass, the power supply is back up and running.
Since Saturday evening at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 21:30 onwards.
Since 23:15, the last affected people also have power.
More than 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were on duty.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighborhood assistance.
Now it is important that citizens in their neighborhoods look after older or single people and report to the local fire stations if help is needed, explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to official reports, temporary care facilities were set up in schools for those people who were unable to care for themselves or who needed power-dependent medical equipment or medical care, respectively.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euros?
It is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the base on the tabletop.
It is a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 variations of this.
We wanted those with table tops with a diameter of #NUMBER#
We got a diameter of 155 cm.
Today, my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I cannot fold it together to shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they would otherwise not be suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate feedback
Yes, that is really easier!
Then let's do it that way!
Can you send me the return shipping label by email?
the repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find this such a low credit almost insulting.
We do not agree with that
Nordic Combined: Riiber, the skier, wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Once again, the duo had to give way to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a large lead after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both upgraded to v4.5...
it could be that they have heard about problems like this before
I have directly contacted my #PRS_ORG#, and bought a book, it seems to be included.
As soon as I try to open it, I get the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
If the file is possibly corrupted, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
The chat connection is gone and now what?
I also have to work in between!
To ensure an even and clean application of paint, you should clean the parts with a little soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse them with clear water, and dry them.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Paint the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlap of the color layers later creates a uniform surface.
Avoid rapid back and forth swiping of the brush.
This results in unrealistically-looking areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could otherwise show through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors are applied last, with a separate brush.
Otherwise, ugly metal scratches can occur if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before baking them.
The models achieve their authentic appearance through decals or transfers.
From emblems on aircraft to ship names to decorative strips and badges on model cars, decals give the model that final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be easier to apply tape to before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than having the right tools such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks is having time, patience, and a steady hand when applying the stickers.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them to your liking.
Decals are also called water slides because you briefly wet the back of them with water until the carrier paper turns dark from the moisture.
Then, you just push the picture a little bit away from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also moistened beforehand).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the transfer paper away from the side.
Attention: Always check that the image is properly aligned before pushing it completely off the paper, so that it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle, or even tear.
Squeeze out excess water with a household cloth.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only briefly open a book when I look at something else, then I can't read the book anymore and I have to log out and log in and reload the book and find the place where I stopped reading.
On Saturday, I already communicated with you.
Will I receive this by email?
Even for all three packages?
After all, the lamp arrived in three separate packages at my place
OK, thank you anyway!
I will shop elsewhere once I get my money back.
But can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment under private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for some time, but now that it comes to billing with the private health insurance, it suddenly puts up a fight.
In order:
We had applied for fertility treatment in advance with the PKV and received approval for three attempts.
The trials were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt resulted directly in a successful pregnancy and birth, which was billed through the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and carried out two (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet include them in our PKV calculations.
We applied again for cost coverage from the private health insurance company and were granted three more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we performed more attempts than we were promised, and logically, charged the most expensive ones to the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received a nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV will only reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: The other two attempts of the first offer are invalidated by the pregnancy/birth.
The second desire for a child is a new insurance case.
However, according to the terms and conditions, "The insurance event begins with the start of treatment, and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here are:
Who is right, the PKV (only three attempts are reimbursed) or us (five attempts are to be reimbursed)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out in the promises that the further attempts would lapse with the birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would share their opinion.
Thank you in advance for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again?
Okay.
We will never order from them again.
If they add up my sales and those of my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost a lot of good customers.
They can certainly pass this on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you are telling me that I have to return the thing first.
I can't really do anything about the fact that the chest of drawers completely disrupts my life when it arrives
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear and obvious that the repayment was initiated and I still have not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect only occurred after several months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is 24 months.
No, I am not able to obtain another type of packaging.
I will disassemble the wardrobe and make it available to the transport company in that state.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional chairs that can be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them at your place.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
What exactly constitutes a low-budget film is not defined by a general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say about this:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture that was shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
There are plenty of lists of low-budget films available online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what do you dislike at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already completely furnished two apartments with your furniture.
I wanted to find out the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you
With friendly greetings
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes about the waiting position...I'll soon give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus comes at high cost for the EU
The EU can announce a "half-victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs are very high and represent a massive violation of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation in a sustainable way, the researcher from the Berlin-based Foundation for Science and Policy Research (SWP) explained.
This limbo state - Belarus is not quite small enough, but the EU feels like the winner - will probably continue for some time yet.
The treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, ruled Bossong.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole has not decided to oppose this, it comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens the cohesion within the Union.
It seems that it cannot assert itself when a member state decides to do its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying an additional price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: The fundamental agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "Border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
Meanwhile, according to Poland's Border Guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested and returned to the border in the night of Saturday to Sunday, said a spokesperson for the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border protection registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU or attempted to do so in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko of luring them to Minsk as a power broker with the promise of EU entry.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly closed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that brought migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent their departures.
The most effective element of the EU's response, said Bossong, is the pressure on airlines.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard gloves and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account the domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly shuttles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - Mercedes has lodged an appeal after the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is alleged to have overtaken illegally.
A second protest was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver occurred shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the cars in front of him.
I check that.
I am speaking with the bank and will contact you again
thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts the SC Freiburg Fantag
The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the park, members and permanent ticket holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, were able to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were coupons for drinks and sausages.
On that day, the roller coaster cars glowed red and white through the jerseys.
Foxy, Ed Euromaus, and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," the park said.
The collaboration between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it was once again demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
Seeing smiling fans enjoying the roller coaster together confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is it €#NUMBER# and not like the original 1699€?

I had a huge problem with you back then, when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# chest of drawers.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday at the sold-out Blue Note, and also served as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast, and listens attentively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I submitted the return form yesterday, but I did not receive an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and cheap, wrongly delivered goods from China.
Your mistake, which we can fix and not all from our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package still wants to reach #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
With friendly greetings

Sorry, but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like an AfD member saying they have nothing against foreigners.
They won't admit to their i's.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just completely avoid it.
Yes, wow, then you are just as unserious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the evolutionary process in general is completely lost.
As far as I'm concerned, a god started it all.
But once you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
To obtain the best field of view, the magnifier should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed achromatic aspherical lens system allows you to use the magnifier virtually free of distortion and color errors right up to the edge of the field of view.
Lenses are often marked with magnification specifications.
However, these figures apply only to exactly defined conditions, which are rarely those encountered in actual use.
To get the most out of your magnifier, please follow the instructions in the table "Technical Data" (see the user manual in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact lenses, light reflections occur.
The reflections are significantly reduced by an antireflective coating.
Under optimal use conditions - the lens close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: Women in the community of Krembz are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many curious situations while selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man even drove home alone without his partner, because they couldn't agree on anything.
Each year, he plants about 2000 of them for this purpose.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations over the years.
This makes the pre-Christmas period always a bit fun, he says.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise, I'm out as a customer!!
At least I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will also rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about which is the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both therefore have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "turner," which sounds nowhere near as delicious.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems setting up a stable WiFi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly, except for a few outages, to receive and send 50 Mbit.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox receives them as well.
However, at the other DLan module, which sends out the WiFi, the full 500 do not come through anymore, but the more I move away from the module inside the house, the less comes through (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This results in the Internet being slower in the first floor with the new fiber connection than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similar losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost with fiber optic cable over the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house now.
I'm really at my wit's end, which is why I created an account here specifically.
Therefore, I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it's time to switch to a current account
Those who thought that now there would be a lull in the savings accounts were mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to trick their customers into confirming past fee increases with all sorts of tricks, the exemption thresholds for negative interest rates are also continuing to fall.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance for free money and even quartered it for the savings account.
In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank division of the conglomerate - to 50,000 euros for current and savings accounts and 25,000 euros for money market accounts.
However, these lower thresholds now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, a spokesperson confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new agreements made individually with existing customers."
The Commerzbank had already previously lowered its limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the limit at ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the exemption limits in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks now have a free allowance of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also reached the 25,000 euro mark: However, there is still a legal dispute going on there with the consumer centers, which even won in the first instance at the Berlin District Court against this regulation.
Now, banks are already discussing whether they should possibly set aside reserves - in case the higher courts declare negative interest rates in principle to be unlawful and millions of bank customers have to be reimbursed.
The tabletop for 8 people instead of the one for 6 people was delivered.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army on her payroll
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who in 2021 made a splash with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
At least, Aniston says, she allows herself a chip a day (yes, read that correctly: just ONE chip from the bag).
That they manage to capture the hearts of both male and female fans alike is actually a miracle.
Perhaps because she just has bad luck with the good fortune - and is still looking for the great love of her life.
And crossed off the baby wish list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would finally become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
One can only hope that success and fame also bring happiness.
An unworthy end to a career: Räikkönen has to retire
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight brush with the barrier, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, and "The Iceman" is ending his career in the motorsport king class.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the world championship in 2007 with Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix races, started from pole position 18 times, and came in third place 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bobsled - Sport
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's record of 94 successes is the target of the bobsledder.
"I've done the math, I'd have to win nine and a half races per season to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he repelled the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths of a second, moving from third place to first.
Then he changed something in the material settings and on Sunday he gained a larger lead of 0.30 seconds.
He beat the British Brad Hall with his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle).
The Austrian Benjamin Maier came in third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also recorded his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was competing for Stuttgart, came in fifth this time after having previously come in second place.
Christoph Hafer from the BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it that way too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home win - Podium for Jamanka
At the women's event, Laura Nolte won her third seasonal victory in the two-man bobsled on her home track.
After only placing fourth the day before in the Monobob, she went on to win the World Cup on Sunday, with pusher Deborah Levi, as part of the German triple victory.
Two-woman bobsled Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thüringen came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She also recorded her first podium finish this winter, in addition to qualifying for the Olympics.
The Wiesbaden native Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was super cool, first podium finish in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me along.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential to be unleashed, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing off, there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not entirely error-free runs, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I did not receive it, so I could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it.
Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had the time for it.
And now it was said that he was expired, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare Bank.
I want to return it and then order it again, since it's currently on sale :)
Why is the delivery only starting on March 16th?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time
No, only when I tap on it does a separate field appear with the message
It was taken away yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong goods that were delivered.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello, dear wonderful girls and girls and women,
I have a lot that I just want to write about, and maybe it resonates with someone else too...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, am a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he's basically my child 1-to-1.
My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday, and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs, and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand was in a bandage due to a burn).
On top of that, he's got a cold, and we're currently seeing each other less often (once or twice a week), which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My little dog just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just away for a month.
Now we also have to do housework, which we naturally divide up between us.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD condition is currently quite well managed, I am reasonably well treated and am coping well.
Not good, but I manage and am almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot from me right now (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test that I haven't prepared for yet, and the next day I have an anatomy class that I should at least prepare a little bit for.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar, not in my head because there's no more room there.
So my week goes: Just a few more days until the weekend.
But then it goes on from there, right?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need those mental cues because otherwise I can't do it.
In some way, I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly infinitely grateful, and I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived without my kptbs.
I think it also has something to do with the mental load that women carry, and that's why I thought I would find kindred spirits here...
I wish you all a restful evening anyway, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately, the whole other color plus surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The first delivery had the exact color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
Now that we're swapping tables, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, twice.
It was not confirmed, however.
Something completely different: I discovered in school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and that it is just another subject for them, like math or geography.
For me, it has always been a bit strange, perhaps also because I was brought up Christian and I always somehow believed.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also tell stories about work or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to keep them separate.
There's also a curriculum and so on.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes one want to teach religion when one does not believe in it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
I hope my question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? I'm happy to write in English, which I understand well
That's been going on for a long time, so I would advise against it
That's good, thank you.
I expect a prompt response, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help with the film search
Hello, dear people,
I am looking for a film from my childhood (I am 24).
I think it was a film for teenagers.
The film has two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernity (the real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not entirely sure).
Since I can't describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman there.
And in the land of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm so that he can live himself. That's what I think, anyway.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's grave site.
At the end, I think the two soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this means anything to you, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has slept on her stomach from week one onwards.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can take much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything else is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check things out more often, but no constant surveillance.
That drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Observe your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten itself up from the belly?
Or is it face down, directly on the mattress?
You can infer from this whether everything is in order.
We are also all grown up now, and when my husband was born, it was completely normal to put the kids to sleep on your stomach.
Also, we are already "regular customers" at your store and have bought many items there already.
But why are you only offering me 20 EUR then?
Hello, I have already written to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received any feedback so far.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I ask that you contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable in this way.
To put it quite bluntly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
But the fact is that the politics of this channel are now a complete mess.
Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that they were an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: "We don't want to be a permanent billboard."
What are we now?
A run-of-the-mill advertising channel that tries to sell its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
These apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and, at the expense of the action, attempts to make a mess with the exploded rented rooms.
How can one possibly find all of this good?
Great if you like it, I find it horrible.
I request a call back, as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Body damage due to a damaged delivery from #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comfort for stomach aches or simply for cuddling - my little heat friend is versatile and can be used in many ways.
Cherry stone pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can very effectively absorb and release heat in doses.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they are not feeling so well.
The cherry stone pillow with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before warming the pillow, check for untypical odors, stains, or burn marks and, if present, dispose of it immediately.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before warming it up!
In the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the microwave manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking it!
Then place the inner cushion back in the cover.
During the first heating, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications.
Always follow the indicated heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy output can lead to damage (fire and burn hazard!).
Check before warming the pillow in the microwave that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion at your elbow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C)!
Do not use the pillow in cases of acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory complaints, fresh bruises, hematomas, hemorrhages, and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor conditions, or are pregnant, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels have come out, dispose of the product and loose kernels immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during application to rule out overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authority in the country where the user is located.
The cover is removable and can be washed at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt finishes the first half of the season in second place - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of a return to the football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table basement.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt either under their third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the botched debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ, about 3 years old) would no longer charge through my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that a power supply alone would be enough for operation.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts even when the power supply is plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but nothing happened there either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop while it's online?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like the #PRS_ORG# delivered right into my room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But doesn't know how high the seat surface is...
Often on tour and yet with a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
The 20-liter capacity easily accommodates larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And all the other everyday items you need are well organized and easily accessible thanks to the convenient access points in the customizable interior, keeping them separate from the photography equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The stylish, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still allowing instant access to the photography equipment.
This works in two ways: either conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, a well-thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags; or via the side zipper.
The closure flap has a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are actually 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
When the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it's more empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This allows the backpack to be reliably closed without the hook snagging.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: in addition to the flap closure, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from the top - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail significantly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: If you take not only your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you.
The Everyday Backpack allows you to customize the interior space (more on that below) so that you can easily separate both items and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the main right compartment, while the everyday items stay safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even when it's going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I have been waiting in vain for an email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the
The shipping company has announced that it will contact the recipient to arrange collection of the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any message.
I request immediate settlement.
I am now already in contact with the third support employee, and with none of them have I gotten further than a promise that I will receive an email confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
Is it then not predictable when the wardrobe could be delivered again?
Keeping him like that is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you so much for the help
I wish you a nice evening
hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, then I'll place a larger order right away, but at least I've kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And I couldn't have known that last year turned out differently than expected, and so I couldn't resolve it in a timely manner as I should have.
But as a customer, I do not accept the damage, and that is not something I can accept.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are cast and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tuned plates are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics that are specific to certain plates and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that focuses on the balancing of the disc according to the properties of the original installation.
The tuned discs produced in this way provide high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted windows emphasize the character of each car by their attractive and eye-catching appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it meant "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and establish businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer peers to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (known as "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your own individual playing style by fine-tuning them to suit your needs.
Coloma takes place over a period of three years, from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a ban!
This deactivates half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then, the players take turns performing actions such as acquiring resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gun heroes.
Once all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The auctioneer rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, thus changing the available actions.
This continues until the enhancer has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shooting scene in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players contribute enough gun heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive smaller rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I use the shipping method and packaging type of Warensendung (games folded) up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else, it is usually DPD insured and has tracking (wrapped in bubble wrap and with packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send the box in a box for an extra charge of 2 euros, which ensures 100% no creases.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter feed today, and I watched it right away.
> Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Kids Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated parenting debate.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
To us parents and other caregivers, it must never, never, never be about gaining power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child the freedom to develop and to make the framework for the child as large as it is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: States consulting on abolition of testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals
The health ministers of the states want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated people.
"We need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing requirement can be lifted for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to Bild am Sonntag.
The abolition of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference already on the following Tuesday." − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
How should I go about it?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer process purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping from the #PRS_ORG# site on the computer works.
I have updated my bank details.
What could be the cause of this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, which refers to sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most often, it involves hearing sounds/voices, less often seeing images, and the least often feeling pain.
For this topic relevant: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with a higher rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia until the weaning process is complete in order to protect the child.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), carry a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine correctly describes awareness, but **u/Nitemarex** by definition had none.
I misread their comment.
The chair is broken, though.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us with that.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the broken chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation and is also standard in the eCommerce sector.
Please check again whether they at least take back the broken chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money that way.
I already sent you an email, which you did not respond to.
The question again.
In the order and on the invoice, it states that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipping company is #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that true?
If so, I must cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor for me.
Am I not going to be called?
I had a question formulated
Günther Rühle, theater historian, died at the age of 97
He has distinguished himself as a theater critic and as a director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theatrical history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is the new book on the table, fresh off the press: "An Old Man Gets Older."
The shattering diary of a slow goodbye to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I hereby testify my gratitude for life."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistik Austria, in 2020 over ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported to Austria annually is not recorded
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After a 1:1 draw in regular time against host team Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York prevailed over Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Tips and tricks for roulades
I got a lot of great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
There was this at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I've got the hang of it and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef stock.
Do you have any other tips for me otherwise?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What happens now?
What about the books, and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I can manage
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on January 18 that the refund had been processed.
But to this day, the money has not arrived at my place.
Please check that.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not yet bought any poultry?
Time is running out now.
We reveal where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube preamp stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME knobs, you can both set the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers in the VT+ series feature a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" or distortion.
Further up, it was already suggested that the POWER LEVEL control can even unleash a reserve of power if things get too loud and obnoxious.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is actually processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or recording directly.
An AUX input can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so that you can jam along to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board, so you don't need a separate tuner.
Those who also purchase a VFS5 foot pedal can conveniently call up sounds with their feet, turn effect blocks on and off, and "tap" the tempo of the effects that are compatible with it.
In live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I saw it differently with others.
Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back to you?
Because it's too low over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it's not possible, I would also be satisfied with a discount or coupon.
Under certain circumstances, I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Paying more than 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is then a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in nuclear agreement negotiations
Progress is reportedly being made in negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement, according to Iranian reports.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that are supposed to be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development," since at the beginning there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revival of the agreement resumed after a brief interruption of just under a week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are participating in the talks.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now has the highest Corona infection rate among federal states
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest infection rate nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only federal state to have a Corona infection rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value as 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has consistently had the highest infection rate nationwide, the value on Sunday was 990.5.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia slightly decreased, but it also exceeded the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, within one day, 2,242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported.
On Sunday, 200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated in intensive care units in hospitals.
Delays in reporting may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is scheduled for early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, right?
here I don't have to click or enter anything else?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for the return at my own expense, please.
An 8 euro return fee is, in my opinion, an outrage.
It's time for change
#Bundestag, welcome to me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why is the post office here?
If you look at the activity in the Bundestag over the past few months, you can conclude one thing: it is not existent.
We have entered a winter hibernation and have extended the summer lull for several months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, this is probably just down to the dissatisfaction of how things have gone here and how we generally stand.
In recent days, there has been a growing impression that many people here still really care about the German Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is called upon to decide which one it wants to keep alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found, to put it simply, a pile of shards.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have found each other and are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would like to call on everyone once again to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How will the German Bundestag function in the future?
* Which existing regulations need to be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a lot, but that's not a big deal, we have Discord at the end to make up for it.
If you have the time and inclination, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's democratically decide on the future.
I ordered a lamp shade from you, which is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for it and not to my taste.
For that reason, I have already ordered another hanging system from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: does the daily cover #PRS_ORG# also come in oversized versions, such as 240/240, for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cupboard will be collected promptly.
And I ask you to make that happen now.
I do not have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pickup - they will need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can be done.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pickup date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long would I have time to obtain these, or to decide to return them?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today, I had a conversation with a colleague that I like a lot.
She herself lived a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and currently probably eats meat very rarely, if at all.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years before that.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism had been a planned interim step, I answered honestly without much thought.
That is, I used to think that as a vegetarian I was supporting animal welfare, but eventually reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that resentment was brewing on their side, and then they defended vegetarianism, saying that they knew where their meat came from and that vegetarians reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "crude"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel that as a vegan, one is quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without it being anyone's intention.
A harmonium-loving vegan greets you (;
This is not a clear exception under § 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not present at the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# collects my return.
Unfortunately, since I cannot be present in person for a funeral, this cannot be changed either.
Please assign me an alternative pick-up date.
From February 01.#NUMBER#, I will be available again continuously.
Lahnsteiner fortified for water rescue: 45,000 euro grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein volunteer fire department to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor, Peter Labonte.
The equipment van is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, permanent increases in the number of calls are expected: The boom in river cruising on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the further increase in the use of the Lahn as a recreational river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, but synchronizing, deleting, and reloading the app did not work.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole operation has already cost me a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Okay, then that's how it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection in June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the previously mentioned values were determined at the Fenix Laboratory at 21°C ±3°C, 50%-80% relative humidity, and with the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.
Values can vary depending on the type of flashlight used, age, and environment.

6) To make a claim under the warranty, please contact our warranty department with the following information: name, type / model of the warranty object, serial number.
First of all, thank you for standing up for this whole thing here. I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar capacity, i.e. we were also armed agents in the executive branch, and I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be very simplistically posed.
In principle, one should say that the civil servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, and this should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it should also be clear to everyone that special uniforms and weapon carriers also attract people on the right who are conservative in a particular way. It should also be clear to everyone that these people obviously have a hard time dealing with the lived reality, since there are now, in addition to the average white person, many Germans with a migration background, women, and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine stereotypical gay person, since there are fewer to none of those in the executive branch, but rather normal men and women who you wouldn't know are gay unless they tell you), and I can rely on these people in the event of doubt to save my life or put it on the line for me.
But even these fringe groups, although it may sound strange at first, according to my experience, represent a conservative stance, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less understood by overblown left-wing politics, even though this politics claims to be acting in their interests or to be on their side, in reality they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, of course, the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, so one will also find extreme rights there. However, the fact that they are allowed to openly express their views there or even openly plot to undermine the state is completely exaggerated and annoys me as well.
Of course, it does happen that police officers and soldiers, who often served abroad, start to generalize negatively after having had bad experiences, and sometimes say things that are controversial or even politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing sympathisers meet up and engage in lively exchanges of ideas.
Nevertheless, this is well combated in my opinion, and also countered by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply interconnected internationally, and I think that's a good thing. We simply can't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
yes, I don't understand why, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered it back in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order placement
My order is still pending, and it is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, one could also deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany, or is this basket available in Germany somewhere else?
I always only find you as a partner company.
but on the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves that have been filled with something yellow
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
Orderly thanks to a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been bothered by something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with very little free time), but I have struggled my whole life to keep my house permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases when everything comes to a standstill, and sometimes it gets to me and I tidy up and clean.
But it's really never "that someone might spontaneously drop by for a visit."
My husband is (unfortunately) not any better either. It bothers me somewhere, but usually the household just loses against work and apathy.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We haven't yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been on my mind for a long time.
Because for me, I have no motivation to do it, it just doesn't bother me that much as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child provide more motivation or does it lead to sloppiness?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality, anatomically pre-formed cut offers maximum comfort, perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted movement.
Pre-shaping with special, further articulation at the joints for improved mobility (at the elbow and knee joints)
The covered area of the Focea Comfort 4 was more than doubled in the Flex System 2 to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, elbows, and knees)
High-quality pre-shaped areas in the lower back and thighs provide a snug, perfect fit.
The Elaskin 8.8 Stretch Panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and donning equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility when moving the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing around the face at the helmet increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate head cover)
The soft zone located in the collar improves the seal with a fine-tunable adjustment of the width by a flexible, gentle velcro closure that does not adhere to the lining or seams
Double-sealed zippers at the elbow and ankle joints connect a foldable inner cuff to a soft, padded neoprene outer cuff
45° indentation at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and strength when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a hood
Long G-Lock P Back-Zip (Overall without hood) with metal sliders and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent ripping if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels glued flush with outer and inner overlap
Edges of the outer cuffs reinforced for greater durability
Edges of the inner cuffs reinforced for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist-mounted computers).
A career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have done a training course in software development and have been qualified for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-doubting (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
Put simply, this means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking on a rational level with people, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told several times that I come across as distant (although I think that has improved).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in areas such as addiction counselling or family support.
However, I don't know if the specific workday is really like how I imagine it, and it's difficult to find anything about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) even now, because it drags me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("I've messed up the simplest things again") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding them back from their work with my stupid questions"/"They must think I'm mentally challenged" etc.).
I will probably have problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
But you have already gotten the sofa back, right?
There was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pick-up appointment
What do they mean by "please return"?
When I download a book to the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems there?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein from the food that the bird takes in is broken down in its digestive tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids). The bird then uses these to build up its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather growth.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the reformation of feathers in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with particularly high demands on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as otherwise it may disrupt the breeding process.
After this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio in 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A scooped measuring spoon (inset) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the regrowth of feathers becomes visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regeneration process is completely complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, away from direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please forgive me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement by a community member in contradiction to the bylaws
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So, a demolition request was submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the bylaws.
However, the walnut is explicitly listed as a tree to be protected in the statutes.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are quite clear.
Thank you for your answers
We get it.
Then we will use the new packaging for that.
I have not received a message
Well, I still have a sofo without using it.
Could you perhaps offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
yes, I believe that, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Urgent news: Serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
According to the current police press alert (14:03), a car went into the opposite lane while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Okay, I understand.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further career development
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is only moderately good because my dear head is currently chewing over everything that can be chewed over.
Before I go into detail here ... in short: I need advice, and preferably from people who know something about my situation - that is, from you.
I'm currently doing the ref as a rookie.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a field there (to at least remain somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific here).
But then it all seemed too boring to me, and I started looking for alternatives that might be more fun.
At some point I ended up in the teaching profession and was sure that this was it - even though the working conditions are much less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I'm now at the third "I google other job postings" stage.
And it's only been half a year.
Before the Malens, I always decided to continue and at least finish the Ref, after which I can still switch over.
But I am absolutely exhausted right now.
I have had so little free time over the last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's holiday time, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress resistant, but there my weekend was my weekend and my evenings were my evenings.
I was free then.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even a family gathering is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
In general, it's fun and from the outside looking in, the Ref runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I am completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can handle before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing so right now.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was appreciated, had free time when I needed it, and although the work was somehow boring, I was paid appropriately and worked as part of a team rather than as a lone fighter, which is the case most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't end up in the same place again a year from now and be unhappy.
You can tell it's all a bit confusing, but maybe as an outsider you have advice or ideas about how I can get out of this situation, which I'm completely exhausted from and practically start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I won't be making any particularly emotional decisions now, and that's probably not going to lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views can help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me.
I hope at least some clarity has been gained about my situation.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of amps from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound quality.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers deliver authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also, of course, feature the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply do a better job of reproducing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system that lets the natural resonances flow freely.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the introduction of the VOX Valve Reactor technology in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 once again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as more and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed to meet the needs of all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During a thorough analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the output stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The 12AX7 tube-equipped Valve Reactor circuit of every VT+ amplifier perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro straps, it adjusts to the needs of your photography equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a hot shoe flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories in there.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (Olympus MFT cameras, Fujifilm X-A or E series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photography-related items.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also an ideal choice for drone pilots, as it offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including the remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused extensive damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data available about previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still dare not predict when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000-degree hot lava has almost completely destroyed nearly 2900 residential homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This is equivalent to almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Offshore, two new land spits were created by cooled lava, with a combined area of about 50 hectares.
The banana industry, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly hard hit, as about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants depend on it directly or indirectly and it was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, according to the newspaper El País.
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still unites our increasingly divided society.
The more important it is to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "peace-making social contract of primitive peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be revived in the context of this tradition.
How Saint Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who associated the Christmas holidays closely with gift-giving.
Beforehand, gifts were presented on St. Nicholas Day in various ways.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw gold into the windows of three women in one night, secretly, to spare them from a life of sin.
This unconventional form of giving led to the popular German tradition of filling the shoes, especially those of children, with gifts.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject the idea of intermediaries between God and humans as "idolatry."
For these reasons, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition line.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve as a result.
Since most Protestants no longer see these details as so important, it only bothers a few people that the tradition of St. Nicholas is still very much a part of the pre-Christmas season, much like the tradition of St. Martin with Martin singing and the St. Martin procession.
Today, one can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches under the Christmas tree and in boots by the door, to suit any heart's desire.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving gifts since the 13th century on St. Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a happy confusion over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas Man, who is essentially a kind of Santa Claus, with certain characteristics assigned to him over time.
These include, for example, his white moustache, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sledge drawn by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is Befana the witch who is said to have led them to the Christ Child.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia Father Frost gained some fame.
Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Otherwise, buy another e-book reader from #PRS_ORG#.
I have requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.

Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the royal palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a man armed with a gun was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who had allegedly gone into a bank and a betting shop with a weapon.
The man fled in a vehicle, according to authorities, which was later stopped by officials.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was already declared dead at the scene of the crime.
The police did not assume a terrorist motive.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with two earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Light duration max. 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic construction is suitable for year-round outdoor use.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully from within, often threateningly.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: It is the sun alone that causes this solar light to fascinatingly glow, either in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The edge-less, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally-formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself as a daytime object.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the neighbourhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he manages to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of work: "Smart Stone" does not require a power supply or batteries as a solar light.
Place the "Luminous Stone" at any sunlit spot during the day.
Two supplied earth pegs provide firm anchoring if required.
The matt white plastic casing itself is robust and weather-resistant.
Its solar module discreetly houses "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As twilight sets in, "Smart Stone" begins to illuminate itself automatically; the color is up to you: Six attractive light colors are available to choose from, in addition to daylight white.
The shutdown also occurs automatically once the battery charge reaches a predefined minimum or it gets light again.
Once the sun comes out again, the charging cycle starts over the next day from the beginning.
I have done that multiple times, and it doesn't work.
That's a shame, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the coupon isn't credited to me, I won't order from you anymore, out of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved once again.
A variable PWM frequency of 10kHz to 50kHz provides super-quiet operation, especially for bell-anchor motors – the typical "humming" is a thing of the past.
The load regulation can now be adjusted up to 10 CVs to accommodate difficult cases.
The unique "AutoTune" feature allows the decoder to automatically tune itself to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder provides enough juice for older motors with up to 1.5A motor current.

Pill problem
Hello, ladies,
I hope I'm doing this right, this is actually my first post after a year on Reddit.
My problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, more or less out of necessity, because I had such incredibly bad period pains and shitty PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it as it is, because I already have to take enough medication for chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last roughly two-year break, I suddenly got explosive pimples from 0 to 100 and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of the break, things never really normalized.
Perhaps someone has some tips to avoid this happening this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without nonsense, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me very seriously, and the dermatologist appointment is still to come.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel from cover to cover!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Vorbupertär had severe neurodermatitis, then a period of calm, then widespread patches of psoriasis and the acne issue.
I have also tried all kinds of things in terms of diet while suffering from a Christian illness, and I have stuck with a diet that is low in sugar, milk, and meat because nothing else has really worked well.
It may also be that hormonally it's just a phase, but if, like me, you have problems everywhere, you just don't want to go looking for anything else that might be wrong.
I had already eaten everything their colleague semina or the like had.
I wrote it and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what the response was to my issue.
I have to work in between, and at the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it if it was
Please check my bank details; maybe something was wrong there
but is it generally available in large sizes?

In the name of the people: Amateurs pass judgement
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
But their verdict depends on a lot, even though they don't wear robes: jurors decide, along with professional judges, whether and for how long someone goes to jail.

110-kV underground cables will be built anew in 2022
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The decision by the government of Lower Bavaria to approve the plan makes way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk now.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long earth cable will connect the Tann transformer station in the north of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning in Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has only arrived with us in part so far.
The blue Betell number #PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the process continues from here?
Have a nice start to the week!
Forget it, I already explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a glass commode and all the sides are broken, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be collected because no one is allowed into my apartment
Thanks for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is the case with all books, which is why I asked #PRS_ORG#, as it is probably a general problem
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello, dear colleagues,
I've been at the Ref since the summer, teaching is fun for me, but I currently have major problems with time-efficient planning of my geography lessons.
Unfortunately, my school is not very well equipped technically, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can also only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need to spend a lot of time just to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently focusing on the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour is different.
In principle, the methods are always the same, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
I usually start planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra, and I am mostly dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence also the worksheets.
Perhaps a geography teacher could tell me how to work efficiently with the book in terms of time.
I would really like that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one from #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade sector is worried about the Christmas business due to the 2G regulation.
In most stores, you can only enter if you are vaccinated or have recovered.
The trade considers this to be unnecessary and laments revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution at the ready.
The 2G regulations are damaging the important Christmas business for retailers, according to the view of the German Retail Federation (HDE).
In terms of sales of non-daily necessities, the HDE chief executive Stefan Genth criticized declines in turnover.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies look negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should have been the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week, according to the report.
Things are going well only in the food retail sector and online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO.
"2G for shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel.
He demanded that the bracelet system be allowed nationwide.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops that day with the band they received.
In addition, spot checks in retail should be sufficient, just as they are in the public transport sector under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Even the property group Deutsche Euroshop, specializing in shopping centers, spoke of a difficult Christmas season.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-corona level without 2G, and sales were at around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business period," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to Wirtschaftswoche.
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, efforts are being made to find solutions and obtain approval for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, can once present their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel, enter all shops unimpeded." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and the frame also has a defect, which was attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler.
It looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repacked it back into the box and sealed it up.
How should I proceed now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is responsible for setting the lamp's color temperature and brightness.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft, high-quality light that is completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree emission angle allows you to illuminate large areas at relatively small distances, which is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work with both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light from television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
The control panel is located on the back of the light, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included) there.
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings for individual settings on the storage locations, simply press and hold one of the storage buttons for a longer period of time and it's done.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can make use of existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check the batteries before setting it up to see if they have enough power - it has a built-in battery tester - the value for each of the two battery compartments is displayed in the two displays (the left battery in the upper display, the right in the lower display).
In addition, of course, it is possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm tube as a connection for mounting, which allows you to connect directly to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set by adjusters on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality, and are therefore designed for long-term durability and heavy use.
Additionally, a swivel joint is included in the package.
It's great that the package also includes a bag.
This way, you can easily transport or store the light with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Shame, I got that as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-filled comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessen, who had lost twice in a row, were apparently on the way to their next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned things around, got rid of their frustration over a patchy start to the season within an hour, and won with a furious 5:2 victory. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner exclaimed on DAZN, and issued a "blanket compliment to everyone who was involved."
It looked like another setback for the Frankfurters, who were still lagging behind expectations in ninth place, at the beginning.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen 2-0 ahead.
What then happened also impressed the SGE coach.
"When the players came back and put on a fantastic performance," Glasner continued, "that's how it is."
I am insanely happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the field for the first time since the fourth game and after overcoming his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, and he was particularly pleased with the result, especially for the spectators, with a glance at the result.
This was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also feels well-positioned in terms of personnel.
It is extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in top condition.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live a very professional lifestyle.
Now, they want to "move forward step by step and remain humble" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level."
Next, on Wednesday as part of the English week, there is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky).
I just received an email saying that my package is being returned to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly back to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and then re-order the item?
Unfortunately, for me, this would mean that I would not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for women's handball team ahead of quarterfinal match against Spain
Germany's female handball team slunk off the floor with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection suffered a crushing defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers, and now has to face host nation Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were far too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we need to act differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished Group III in the main round with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danish team (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game for everyone, and we have to erase it," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle to reach the semi-finals, a significant improvement is needed against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on the next Tuesday to keep alive the faint dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German thrower in the match against three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels, a backcourt player, with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We now need to look forward quickly."
From front to back, not up to scratch
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the top of their game at the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with a few parades.
The first goal for the DHB team came after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
This was, however, not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women had little opportunity to make an impact - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian team.
The game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, given that backcourt player Mia Zschocke was sent off shortly afterwards for a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she can participate again in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection manage to get into the game a bit better, and at least came within five goals of the opponent by the half-time break.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Groener proteges committed errors in all areas, making it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is a medal contender at the finals, to take advantage.
As a result, the German team was unable to muster a performance improvement and left the floor as a clear loser.
DACH Advent calendar day 6: Family traditions in the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we snagged St. Nicholas Day and use this as an opportunity to focus on family traditions during the pre-Christmas period, Advent, St. Nicholas Day, Christmas Eve, and Christmas holidays.
How was it like at home back then?
Like your partner's?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children too?
What is the best thing for the children?
The boot polishing?
Baking cookies?
Tree decorating?
Is anyone playing music?
Does Santa Claus come, or is it the Christ Child? Or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort around Christmas to try to have the family as nice as possible.
Whether it's established traditions or something different every year: tell us how it went in your family!
Please send me any transaction number... or anything else that might help
Payment confirmation... etc
I would like to give a gift voucher code
just like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Do they do that there?
The title implies that I am a mobile vaccinator working in vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Once these are soon largely completed, it will then go on to some extent to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, provided they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, is it compatible with the vaccination...?").
In my area of responsibility, I am responsible for informing people about the vaccination, determining the indication (a person has a right to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination order and no reasons against it), documenting the doctor's findings, and, if necessary, providing emergency care for allergic reactions (this has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have nurses, but only (for heaven's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for preparing vaccines, who are not allowed to administer vaccines (allowed to?), so I carry out most vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the answer
What exactly is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by someone from Amberg, has caused a lot of head scratching in the BR television program "Wir in Bayern".
However, unlike on many previous days, the term remained unguessed by the callers this time in the series "Host mi?"
No, it was not a "nervous person."
And also no one who "has to do everything quickly."
That, the people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Where the man from Amberg announced the solution, which probably caused astonishment among many people in the Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a cloth used to wipe the oven clean."
Dialectologist Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more familiar dialect word "Houdern".
Closing a gap in education - probably also for many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks now.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized it, and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice for a racing bike - really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I still wanted to train a little in preparation for my bicycle tour next week.
I said it, did it, and I set off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40 km were also really nice - but then, the thing that lurks in every city (this time: Thanks, Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire definitely did not want to participate in the rest of the ride anymore.
As I had no real opportunity on a weekday to get a replacement jacket and hose, I had to turn around and take the first train home with a rather bad mood.
It was also not quite as bad emotionally, perhaps it's even better if I practice changing the tire one more time before the bike ride.
Now, however, I am faced with a question and I hope that you can help me.
As I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days ahead of me, I would much rather not have this problem recur frequently.
Now, it really wasn't that bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had ridden 120 km by 4 pm on the day I picked up the bike, wearing them out!) were also there, and he had already described them as suboptimal, as he had used them for several years on rollers.
But when I think about the fact that I still have to change a tire after 80-90 km of driving, I'm probably really in a bad mood :D
Now I have gotten into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unpuncturable.
Of course, it all sounds very tempting now.
But are they really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tyre now, only to be disappointed in the end.
I also wonder: I think I currently have 25x622 on the road bike at the moment.
There are also those (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me to get different tires for a racing bike in general?
The Schwalbe site seems to recommend my absolute! layman's knowledge the Durano DD more?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!
Car hits tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old crashed his car into a central island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for unknown reasons, and then ended up on the opposite side of the road, the police reported.
There, it collided head-on with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree, trapping the man inside.
The 27-year-old, as well as his 23-year-old passenger, were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.
yes, we have deleted all the books, reauthorized everything, and loaded new books

After the release of our new high-end broadband speaker B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also welcome new additions.
The new offspring is called SOLO 15 and visually resembles the great predecessors with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design proposal includes a suitably designed foot that is included to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
The SOLO 15 is inherently suitable for persons for whom the maximum volume plays a relatively minor role, but for whom an exceptionally high sonic level is desired.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of generating such large unfiltered sound pressure levels.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and for her size very impressive and accurate in her movements.
Tonal, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble boost.
This is generally common practice with broadband antennas to optimize the strongly increasing high-frequency bundling.
Focused exactly on the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
By slightly rotating the tweeter outwards, the treble range can be reduced, resulting in a warmer sound image.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM result in a dynamic response that is unmatched.
The SOLO 15 thus not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to consider the final aesthetics of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan for corresponding changes during construction.
For example, if one wants to veneer the casing, the speaker's depression must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
Once all the plates have been cut (e.g. at a hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the corresponding location in order to be able to easily run the cable through there later.
With the help of a router, the speaker opening in the front is now cut out, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be flush fitted later.
On the back side, this opening should be fitted with a 45° chamfer to maximize the opening area of the speaker chassis inside.
The four soldering points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the "Detail Fase" image.
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two sidewalls on a flat surface in front of oneself.
Now the back, lid, front, and base are glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be installed and glued in place.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in thickness as needed, provided that one opts to use ready-made moldings from the hardware store rather than making them out of 16 mm MDF oneself.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then come all the plates of the foot, that is, the two sides, and the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or a Forstner drill, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex port, as well as the connection clamp on the back panel, is facilitated.
Next, a rounding bit is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off using this method.
Next, the base is firmly glued to the foot of the case and additionally secured with long wooden screws.
Next, the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill bit) of the screw holes for the speaker chassis and the connection terminal is done.
After the case has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming/blowing), the cable laying begins.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back panel.
To do this, one pushes the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, and then lets it stick out about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there as well.
Next, the frequency converter is prepared and put into use.
The frequency switch circuit diagram, as well as the corresponding wiring diagram, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
Once the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
With the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and a bit of skill, you can pour hot glue onto the opening and thus seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, one can check the seal accordingly.
Now comes the dampening, according to the description.
Next, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and secured with the appropriate screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen the sound, a mat of the damping material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June, even though it's still early spring?
Hello to all of you
Finally, we can announce that we are organizing the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, due to known reasons, we are unable to accommodate more than four people in the studio, which entails a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the switch, so we will be streaming the Oscars 2021 with at least seven beans and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get drinks cold in advance, plan good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night ahead.
