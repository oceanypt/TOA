Students play the main role at the annual conference of Zhejiang University, research results open the minds of people-Xinhua News Agency
Washing hands with air, diagnosing diseases with breath, and accurately searching for smog sources Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year at Zhejiang University, a series of mind-blowing academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers behind these achievements are students, whose research covers the environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities and education. Starting with a curious idea, students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won national and international awards.
Biosensors: Your Home Physician
The team of Zhang Diming, a PhD student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on a smartphone that is half the size of a smartphone.
“All you need to do is take a deep breath, and the instrument will give you a preliminary indication of your health from the composition of the gas you exhale.”
Zhang explains that the sensors are connected to a smartphone, and when the gas is exhaled, a health report is displayed on the phone.
Smart wristbands that can monitor health status are available on the market, and generally monitor physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor, using graphene, a new material that targets chemical elements, has a sharp “smell” that gives it a deeper, more accurate sense of health.
Intelligent Surgical Lights: Powerful Eyes for Doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are being used in operating rooms.
The invention won a silver prize at this year's 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of graduate students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, Lin Jing Zhu and Jun Fei Shen, opened new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights, invented the smart LED shadowless surgical light.
“Many diseases that are not detected and removed early are related to the lights that doctors use in their operating rooms.”
Shen Junfei says that, for example, in early cancer screening, if the doctor does not see all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
The smart surgical lamp has four discs that enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During surgery, the surgeon can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and opacity of the light spot at any time, according to surgical needs and personal habits.
This smart surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Shao Yifu Hospital, affiliated with the Zhejiang University Medical School, and the Children's Hospital, affiliated with the Zhejiang University Medical School, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won first prize at the National Challenge Cup.
Washing Hands with Air: Water-Saving and Cool
While ordinary people wash their hands with water, a little soap, and a little hand sanitizer, Lee and his classmates invented an “air hand-washing device.”
Just by standing on the sink of the device, our body weight would compress the air out.
"It's like a balloon.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
That way, we can wash our hands clean!”
The colouring reaction and bacterial residue experiments showed that the effect of hand washing with this method was the same as that of normal hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, both to ensure the degree of cleaning and to save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, the invention stood out among many of the world’s top universities, winning the sole gold prize.
Please arrange to get back to me as soon as possible, thx.
Please cancel the order and refund the cash, no points, no more #PRS_ORG#!
Bone and spicy vegetables are not suitable for children to eat
If yes, please order as soon as possible.
No, thank you.
He asked me to tell you where he was.
I can't wait. Cancel the order.
I #PRS_ORG# bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can it be changed?
OR CANCEL YOUR ORDER
Okay, that's it.
I think it's a very meaningful certificate, a first aid certificate.
This is one of the skills certificates that I think is important besides the driver's license!
Let's generalize: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time after an accident until the ambulance arrives, and it is this period of time that is crucial.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, a stroke, a cardiac arrest, then we have a window of life of four minutes, golden four minutes!
So the people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone falls around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them, rather than standing there stupidly, unable to do anything. That feeling of helplessness is too frightening.
“In China, our official figures are three million accidental deaths a year, the most dangerous of which is sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% are saved.
In casino hotels in Las Vegas, 70% to 80% are saved, compared to less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing.”
That's what First Response founder Lu Lei said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, you don't do anything.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed before rescue is possible.
I find that few of us now have this awareness to learn first aid, but when it happens, it is too late, so I appeal to all of us to learn this skill so that we can react in a timely manner when faced with an emergency.
Maybe it could save a life!
The first aid certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross training center, I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students also have discounts.
PS: The last picture is a list of my goals to accomplish before I turn 25. I added the first aid certificate to my list a few months ago, but I did it!
Then to examine the other certificates to be examined, I intend to take a diving certificate, before the Little Red Book saw a diving first aid certificate, the certificate seems to have a first aid certificate to be examined, so in fact first aid certificate is very useful!
I've ordered.
One of those 13-dollar shrimp dumplings?
I haven't tried.
Why don't you write #NAME#?

Yesterday #PRS_ORG# leaked meals, this time give me a shrimp dumpling!?
Because I saw it was valid when I entered the code earlier.
To conclude, I personally think The Four Seas is a complete mess, in every sense of the word.
But if you're going to say that the film isn't a highlight, it's not because the music isn't at least good.
There are many types of bad films, from the ones that make you fall asleep in the cinema to the ones that make you feel outraged at the end. The Four Seas is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, and it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is truly gifted at insulting audiences.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation from a Chinese novel, unremarkable and full of holes, like a windbreaker on a little horse.
Even after you’ve seen it, you’ll wonder if there’s a metaphor behind it, but when you think about it, it’s just shit.
"I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do.
The protagonist is supposed to live on a small island far to the south, depending on his grandmother.
Her grandmother has a wish to see snow, and the plot arranges for a neighborhood gentleman to drive a minivan and take her to the northeast to see snow.
An elderly man riding a van from the south to the north-east to see the snow?
He and his father were very confident about it.
Then the old man stopped.
How did her brother get a license to run a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why is it so easy for a bunch of idiots on an island to shut down a section of a mountain road?
Then, in the middle of the road, the truck that was delivering the reinforcements stopped on the side of the road, and it was impossible to find the truck driver around.
It's too obvious.
Why should an unreliable, suspected criminal be an assistant police officer?
When asked why he did not call the police, the policeman in the film specifically asked if he had any difficulties.
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn’t know how to use a hotel card to open a door, and then forcefully arranges to sit outside his room for the night without being able to find the hotel owner?
This mystery permeates the entire film, and the scenes are so far-fetched that it hurts me to recall them.
Besides the plot, what is worse is the film’s plot, or lack thereof, which is a disgusting patchwork.
At the beginning of the film, you think he wants to make a comedy, after 20 minutes you guess it might be an animation, halfway through you think it might be a drama about the struggles of young people in a small town, and at the end you don’t know what you’re watching, followed by deep self-doubt about why you’re going to the cinema to see poop on New Year’s Eve.
For most people, it’s also very familiar that if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, you’ll make a movie about motivation and comedy, and then tell the audience how a talented novice gets to success step by step.
If you want to make a love story, you tell the story of a town boy who loves to ride a motorcycle and a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot can't contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
(For example, the character played by Yun Cheong, whose new motorcycle has just been burned, and yet he can still sing), you can't create brain holes that even Kennedy wouldn't be able to see.
As for the fact that the heroine, who is not mentally retarded, acts in some ways like a five-year-old, I don't know if it's because of her acting or because of the director's demands.
I also wonder why Han Han, as a racer, is so keen to add crash scenes to his own films.
Is this kind of film scheduled for the Spring Festival to add to the crowds?

Chongqing Vocational School Pilots Modern Apprenticeship System-Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, reporters learned from the City Education Committee that from this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students receiving pilot training will also have apprenticeship status, and after admission, they will be pre-registered as employees by pilot enterprises.
Municipal education and training committees are required to regulate the recruitment and admission procedures for secondary vocational schools and enterprises, to clarify the dual status of apprentices as students of secondary vocational schools and as employees of enterprises, and to sign tripartite agreements between apprentices, schools and enterprises in accordance with the principle of two-way selection. In the case of apprentices who have reached the age of 16 but have not reached the age of 18, agreements must be signed between the apprentice, his or her guardian, the school and the enterprise, determining the rights and interests of each party and the specific position, teaching content and protection of the rights and interests of the apprentice on the job.
Pilot schools are encouraged to use modern forms of apprenticeship to conduct pre-employment training and transition training for enterprise employees jointly with cooperating enterprises.
The pilot schools are to reform the model of talent development.
Schools and enterprises jointly design human resources development programmes and jointly develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise masters &apos; standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
The duration of students &apos; internships in enterprises is determined in accordance with the programme for the training of professional talents, and the duration of top-level internships is generally six months.
According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can take 2 to 5 apprentices and form a learning group, ensuring that the students master the skills required for each rotational training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will establish 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches, each pilot with a number of about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
In accordance with the principle of first piloting and then implementing, and gradually advancing from point to face, it will explore the establishment of long-term effective mechanisms for joint recruitment, joint training and integrated human resource development between schools and enterprises, effectively improving students &apos; job skills and improving students &apos; employment rates and employment quality.

South African doctors: Omicron is highly contagious, but mostly mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus causes less severe symptoms than the Delta variant, even though it spreads faster.
As the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa, reported that the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as flu-like body aches and coughs, according to the Associated Press.
The organization’s director, Dr. Unben Pillay, says he sees dozens of patients a day, but none of them require hospitalization.
“They can control the disease at home, and most recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation,” says Pillay.
This, he said, includes older patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to become seriously ill with COVID-19.
In contrast, he says, the COVID-19 patients he treated during the previous Delta outbreak “had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many are hospitalized within a few days.”
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take weeks to collect enough data, doctors’ observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Infectious Diseases, only 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks are seriously ill, half the proportion in the previous wave; the average length of hospitalization has decreased from eight to 2.8 days; and only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients die, compared with 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Citing data from the National Institute for Infectious Diseases and other reports, Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, said: “At this point, almost everything indicates that this is a mild disease.”
He added, “It’s early days, and we need to get some late-stage data.
Normally, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we have only been in this wave for two weeks.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and the rates of hospitalization, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the dominant COVID-19 strain worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicentre of the outbreak.
According to health officials, new cases in Gauteng increased by 400% in the first week of December, with tests showing that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been delivered!

Education Review: How to Save Kidnapped Children?
By analogy with the well-known public service slogan “no killing, no buying,” in a good environment where there is no demand for “kidnapping,” crowd prevention and crowd control will make kidnapping and trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, a platform for the urgent dissemination of information on the disappearance of children, developed by the Office for Combating Child Abduction of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, went online.
It is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the dissemination of information on the disappearance of children and the prompt return of abducted children.
Hearing the name of this app is "reunion", feel warm.
New technological tools are not only named “art” and filled with emotion, but are also properly used, practical, and effective.
The primary objective of anti-abduction law enforcement is to recover abducted children and to protect their safety and freedom.
Then comes the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, to social prevention, to legal education, can be described in many “big words.”
Priority should, however, be given to the physical safety of the victims until the cases of trafficking have been uncovered.
It is a matter of priority, and controversial topics such as whether child trafficking should be punished with the death penalty can be put aside and discussed with caution in the name of urgent “rescue.” But rescuing kidnapped children cannot be delayed.
According to experience gained in investigating such cases, traffickers usually leave the scene of the crime as soon as possible.
For every minute the search is delayed, the child may be one step further away from his or her parents, making the case one more difficult to solve.
In such circumstances, it is indeed pragmatic to provide effective tools, such as the “Reunification” platform, that can directly assist in detecting cases and finding children.
After all, “kidnapping” is a huge task that requires an entire legal system to work.
Combating crime and safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from improving legislation to ensuring justice and rigorous law enforcement, all need to be carried out with the concern of "protecting children and helping the weak."
Moreover, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, could be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three is resting at a train station, and the parents are asleep when they wake up to find that their children have disappeared.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, one should at least be reasonably protective.
Alternating periods of rest for both parents, or placing the child under secure protection, are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
In the context of the police &apos; s fight against trafficking in children, the purchase of abducted children should also be addressed and punished.
A single wrongful act is often only one link in a long chain.
In accordance with the provisions of our Penal Code, the statutory penalty for the offence of kidnapping and trafficking in children is five years &apos; imprisonment and, in the case of particularly aggravating circumstances, the death penalty and confiscation of property.
The minimum penalty is high and the maximum penalty is severe, and it is clear that the crime of kidnapping and selling children is one of the most severely punished offences in the context of the general trend towards “lighter sentences”.
However, a considerable number of cases of trafficking still occur every year.
As a result, some people &apos; s attitudes towards the upbringing of their children are backward and their awareness of the law is weak.
The legal education of this segment of the population should be carried out at the same time.
Effective control of trafficking in persons requires more than strict official law enforcement.
If the kidnapping “market” is widespread, and the kidnappers are motivated by their greed and are constantly innovating kidnapping tactics, creating a situation of “fight and flight” with law enforcement, anti-kidnapping operations will inevitably become ineffective.
Therefore, the eradication of backward attitudes and the dissemination of general knowledge of the law will also help to eradicate the crime of kidnapping and buying and selling children.
The Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Drawing Strength from the 100 Years of the Party's Struggle
On the morning of December 10, in accordance with the unified arrangement of the Provincial Committee, Yang Haodong, Standing Committee Member and Minister of the Department of Public Information of the Provincial Committee, gave an interactive lecture in the Ma Bao Shan Video Cultural and Creative Park, studying in depth the implementation of the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Nineteenth Central Committee of the Party, studying the implementation of the spirit of Secretary General Xi Jinping's important instructions and directives on Hunan, and studying the implementation of the spirit of the Twelfth Provincial Congress of the Party.
Yang Haodong articulated the core tenets and practical requirements of the spirit of the Plenary Session in a thorough, comprehensive and systematic manner, combining his own perceptions and personal experiences in three areas: ideal beliefs and the mission of the heart, self-revolution and the Great Youth Party, and the leadership of the Party and the theory of the Party.
He said that the spirit of the plenary session and the spirit of Secretary General Xi Jinping's important speech on Hunan, the spirit of the provincial party congress, should be combined and learned, and the awareness of defending the "two establishments" and achieving the "two preservations" should be strengthened in thought, politics and action, and the direction of Secretary General Xi Jinping's guidance should be firmly followed.
During the interactive discussion, grassroots cadre representatives, business representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historic resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the "two establishments", how to guide cultural enterprises, and how the youth of the new era can draw strength from the 100-year history of the Party. Yang Hodong answered them one by one in plain language and with vivid examples. He urged young Party members to draw strength from the 100-year history of the Party's struggle, closely unite around the Party Central Committee, firmly follow the Party, and dedicate their youth to writing responsibilities and responsibilities.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories, virgin olive oil and lampante olive oil or refined olive oil, with five grades.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olives by mechanical cold pressing, filtering and other treatments to remove foreign matter.
Depending on the acidity, there are three levels:
Extra virgin olive oil: This is the highest grade and quality of olive oil, a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant aroma, and the acidity does not exceed 1 per cent.
Fine virgin olive oil: slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2 per cent, pure and aromatic taste.
Ordinary virgin olive oil: Taste and aroma are acceptable, acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is olive oil obtained by refining virgin olive oil with an acidity greater than 3.3% or by becoming a "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to harmonize flavour and colour, with an acidity of less than 1.5 per cent and a transparent pale golden colour.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil extracted from pomace by the dissolution method and refined.
The acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
After all, olives are like grapes for wine, and olives from different regions and varieties produce different standards of olive oil.
The best places to grow olives are:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions, such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and rainfall, for olives to grow.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, there is only sporadic cultivation in suitable areas.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, as well as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on, far to the south.
Olive harvesting months:
From March to June each year, olive trees bloom and bear fruit, and from July to October, the fruit begins to develop and ripe, changing from green to red, purple and finally black.
From November to February is the harvesting season (the freshness of the olive oil is important).
Nutritional composition of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, i.e. oleic and linoleic acids, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be one of the most nutritious fats found to date.
Democracy Summit Closes, Biden Says the Flame of Freedom Will Never Go Out
The online “Summit for Democracy,” convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by government, civil society, and private-sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, ended on Friday, December 10.
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also announced plans to convene a second global “Democracy Summit” next year.
A representative of the Taiwanese government, Tang Feng, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lau Kwan Sung, now in exile in Britain, also addressed the second day of the summit.
“We know how much work lies ahead of us,” Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because, as I said earlier, democracy is everywhere, as this summit has shown.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the flame of freedom that burns in the world and in the hearts of people everywhere.”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires a concerted effort by society as a whole.
“As leaders of government,” he said, “we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the defences of democracy, to push for reform, and to achieve transparent and accountable governance that is more resistant to the forces of tyranny and those who seek power over the public good.”
The second day of the “Democracy Summit” focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values, respectively.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks that day, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also noted that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, particularly those posed by emerging digital technologies.
“It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions, and the resilience of democracy,” he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including using all the tools offered by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lau Guanzhong addressed the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China’s ethnic minorities, including the Uighurs and Tibetans.
“For too long, the world has accepted China’s rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it to account,” he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our first priority.”
Rao also called on the free world to unite against the CCP’s threat.
“Maybe some of you are afraid to upset Secretary General Xi, maybe some of you don’t want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some of you don’t recognize the threat to our democratic values,” he said.
And that is why we have failed.
That’s why we have to change.”
During the round table discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship, Affirming Democratic Values," Tang Feng, a member of the Executive Council of Taiwan, issued the National Statement via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the struggle against tyranny and authoritarianism.
He also shared experiences on how to fight COVID-19 through transparency of information and building trust.
He said, “As Taiwan’s democracy continues to flourish, we stand firmly at the forefront of the global struggle against authoritarianism and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights.
As authoritarian governments around the world justify human rights violations in the name of public health and the collective good during the pandemic, global democracy is showing signs of decline.
But in Taiwan, we don’t have to shut down our cities to control the pandemic, and we don’t have to go to jail to defeat disinformation.”
On the second day of the “Democracy Summit,” the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea, and several other countries for serious human rights violations, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company for using surveillance technology to assist human rights violations.

Hello, the turkey from the restaurant was raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to keep it up, so I want to find something at a similar price to practice with.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices tend to be proportional to the degree of friendliness, and if you can't tell, then the expensive normal is more friendly than the cheaper beat, this kind of "entry-level beat" is actually industrial garbage.
They are low-intensity, and the ball is hit on the beat, vibrating so much that the hard ball cannot be held, making it difficult for even the best players to control it.
The logic and underlying message is that tennis is so difficult, that you can't learn it, that you can't afford to buy it, that you're being fooled by cheap stuff, that if you play it twice, you won't be able to play it again, that it's cheap and you won't get hurt.
When you really know what's good and what's bad, that means you've progressed, and then you can come to me and buy expensive things, and I'll make double the money.
Recommended to spend similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, choose Prince, or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good racket can not sell the price, new 500, 600 is good, second-hand 200 pieces, do not smell the pleasure of having a thousand yuan racket?
It is friendly to newcomers, but once you get past the newcomer stage, it gets tough, but most people, especially girls, don't get past the newcomer stage.
The order has been delayed several times
Could you please follow up?
Deferred
Thank you.
So, I already have credit?
Do I need to place an order again?

In fact, a lot of attention is paid to the combination of clothing for a girl with a fat body.
Obese girls wear skirts that are neither too short nor too long, reaching almost to the knees, just enough to cover the fat of the thighs.
Skirts that are too short will reveal the fat on your legs.
Too long will make you feel short and fat.
If you wear it in three pieces, it will appear that you are naturally taller, because the top, skirt and long socks are of different colors, and it will look like an elongated feeling.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard fit for fat girls (the author deeply realizes this), dark colors are also a good way to hide your fat body, and the noble and elegant black short skirt is also the first choice of fat girls.
Wearing dark colored clothes, especially black skirts, will make you look slimmer.
If your legs are fat, your socks and shoes should not be too conspicuous.
The more popular, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
Don't make people feel fat when they look at your legs and feet.
For a slightly fat girl, it is necessary to talk about the tricks of good clothing combinations.
Obese girls should never wear tight short skirts, and the top should not be too short or crammed into the skirt, will make people look very uncomfortable, if the legs are thick, to wear black long socks or mesh socks (the fine checkered one oh), choose a soft texture printed trumpet dress, paired with a sleeveless top, can very well hide the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, fat girls wear short skirts.
A fat girl wearing a short skirt should choose a top that matches the color of the short skirt, which will make your fat body look taller.
Short skirts combined with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most IN combination of summer!
If you are a MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous skirt.
Not only does it hide your belly, but it also shows off your strengths.
A-line skirt will be very thin, more suitable for fat girls, the top to choose a tighter, forming a sense of layering will be thinner.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt, fat MM can also try.
Fat girls are also able to wear fashion.
As long as you can master the rules of good clothing combinations so fat girls will be the focus of attention.
After changing the way you dress, exercise more in your life, and try to get rid of the label of a fat girl sooner 😄

Girl as a target for her sister to raise money: "I think it's skin injury is also good" - Xinhua News Agency
A girl in Hangzhou’s Wuling Square stands in front of a large wooden board with the words “Human Target, 10 Yuan an Arrow.”
Yesterday morning, a photo of a “Hangzhou girl willing to become a ‘target’ to raise money for her sister” went viral.
The photo shows a girl in Wuling Square, Hangzhou, standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than herself, with the words “human target, 10 yuan an arrow” written on it, suggesting that passers-by can shoot with bows and arrows after paying.
The act triggered a heated debate among netizens.
Last night, the head of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau of the Lower City Branch confirmed to reporters that the police confirmed that the girl collected donations for her sister to make such a radical move, but such behaviour is not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls street "target" fundraising was warned
In the picture, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of the Chinese character “个” in front of a large wooden board with the words “human target, 10 yuan an arrow” written in black ink.
The picture went online and sparked controversy.
Some netizens described the move as “eye-popping begging,” and many expressed sympathy.
“We discovered the situation when we patrolled the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd, when the crowd was already quite large.”
When interviewed by the local media, the civilian police at the Tianshu police station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls at the stall, both about 20 years old and dressed in youthful and beautiful clothes.
Among them, the girl who was the “target” kept crying and begging the passers-by to play the game; another girl on the side helped shouting, saying that her friend’s sister has leukemia and now urgently needs surgery, please help everyone.
“We contacted local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting donations for her sister’s leukemia treatment.”
Last night, the head of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau in the Lower Town told reporters that the girl's name was Jia Li, and she was collecting donations for her sister Jia Yan.
However, as the cost of treatment was still more than 300,000 yuan, he did not think of a good way to collect donations, so he committed this act.
He said that the two girls, one as a target and the other as a shooter, had not participated in the event, and that no archers had been seen during the event, except for a few spectators who had taken pictures and posted them on Weibo.
The arrows and bows used were later identified by the police as not falling within the scope of the regulations.
“We don’t advocate this kind of eye-popping fundraising,” the official said.
After being warned by the police officers, she left the police station.

What’s Hot in 2021?
Without a doubt, the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes get prizes?
Some time ago, there was a hot article "Look! Project managers can hit the Olympic gold medal", which mentions that project managers in many projects, absolutely can be ahead, no one can match: Moving bricks, traveling, staying up late at night is the daily life of project managers, firefighting, back pot, and apologies are even more important.
An article that seems to be a joke, but also speaks of the daily bitterness of project managers, representing the underlying discontent with the current project management work.
Those involved in project management are also increasingly choosing to take action to free themselves from the dilemmas of their work.
A growing number of project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management skills, as evidenced by the rising number of PMP (Project Management Professional) enrollments each year.
According to the China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the national cumulative number of PMP® candidates was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified candidates was about 420,000, and the number of effective license holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® license holders worldwide.
The steady increase in the number of PMP holders over the past decade indicates that a growing number of project managers are realizing that it is no longer desirable to simply copy past “best practices.” The rapidly changing environment in which we work tells us that we need to learn, stand on the shoulders of scientific giants, and explore the way forward.
But does the PMP exam guarantee that project management will run smoothly?
Many project management beginners say that by studying the relevant courses such as PMP / IPMP, you can systematically master the 10 areas of project management and five process groups and other related knowledge points, but when it comes to project management work, it is still a fog.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: Project management awareness is not in place, purely based on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; Lack of system project management process system support, the work can not get on the ground, project prediction is not accurate, control sensitivity is poor, the project drags again and again; Members division of labour is unclear, the team "old oil bar" do not know how to deal with cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, project difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R & D management for more than ten years, has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of product managers, project managers and other R & D key talents, and has been awarded the honorary title of "China enterprise R & D management talent training demonstration base" and other honorary titles.

It is also an opportunity for companies to use lower costs and less input to facilitate the development process of project managers and bring efficient operational results to the company.
This course is not only by the team of experts China Huaxia (formerly Huawei R & D management team), combining international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprises real business scenarios, the content of the course in-depth professional lecture.
Moreover, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, to help students to transform the learning content applied to specific work after the class.

捷信“双十二”前夕向消费者倡导理性消费 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站
This year, the amount of online payment transactions at the Carnival reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
A variety of full discount packages, eye-catching live delivery once again make consumers shout to benefit, this consumerism on the one hand to admire the nation's consumer power is becoming stronger, on the other hand also had to calm down to think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of the "Double Twelfth", Chexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Chexin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumer awareness and consumption habits, and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, up 2.04 from 2019.
Overall, our residents perform well at the level of financial consumption, but there are greater differences in different aspects of financial behaviour and skills, and the level of basic financial literacy needs to be further improved.
The level of financial literacy of older people and adolescents is relatively low, and “one old and one young” will continue to be the focus of financial education; Nielsen’s “China Youth Debt Status Report” and the “2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report” published by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has a huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way of upgrading consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have not accumulated debt. Although the younger generation as a whole presents a rational consumption trend, although it differs greatly from the “excessive waste” label affixed by the outside world, some young people do indeed have excessive consumption and consumer behavior, and therefore generated excessive financial pressure and debt risk, even leading to a gradual increase in social problems.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jixin has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality, attentive services, advocating for consumers to establish good and correct consumer perceptions, and actively responding to regulatory calls, by taking practical action to raise consumers &apos; awareness of rational consumption, especially among young people.
During the past few years, Jiaxin has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge dissemination activities for young people, including university students, and by collaborating with top universities in the country to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms of subversive memorization of young people's consumption needs to provide reasonable guidance, help them establish rational consumption concepts, reasonably plan consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of the coming of the Chinese New Year, China Post would like to remind all consumer friends to develop a reasonable consumer awareness and correct monetary concept, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid mistakes in consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
It is important to plan your spending in advance and make every effort to repay your loans on time.

Viet Nam People's Daily - Gulf Cooperation Council Meets Common Challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s stopovers include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this was Crown Prince Mohammed’s first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on the country in mid-2017, leading to a Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a full embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups and maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal cohesion of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the GCC summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards “unity and stability.”
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors to the country.
The resolve of the Arab Gulf States to resolve their differences in order to resume relations with Qatar stems from the need to unite in the interests of all States and of regional stability, with a view to addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince &apos; s visit to Oman, the parties agreed to open the first direct land link between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725-kilometre corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the movement of citizens and the integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding for cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince’s visit to the Gulf countries comes at a time when Iran is negotiating with the world’s major powers to save the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – an agreement that the Gulf Arab states have denounced for failing to resolve Iran’s missile issue.
The Gulf states have long regarded Iran as a “competitor,” and its nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf States consider it flawed not to address the Iranian missile issue and to take action to curb Iran &apos; s activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia has engaged in direct negotiations with Iran in the context of the failure of the nuclear negotiations between the major Powers and Iran to meet the aspirations of the Gulf States.
Its aim is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first meeting of GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to re-evaluate the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to promoting the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

Okay.
It is said that the new mountain area super race exhaust noise is the largest!
This time our team brings you this car, the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
The price is almost two million ringgit, a year road tax tens of thousands of ringgit, four-wheel drive, why called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
The acceleration from 0-100 km/h takes just 2.9 seconds, and the top speed is 160 km/h.
The low body, the imposing scissor doors, the huge air intakes all around the body, and the 6.5-liter V12 engine that can be seen clearly under the glass, are perfect examples of Lamborghini style.
For the description of the car does not need to say too much, just Google yourself, the editor compiled some Google does not necessarily give the explanation!
It's so much attention, wherever you go, everyone is looking, it's very uncomfortable! (actually, it's a bit cool)
1 km fuel costs around RM1 (the owner does not care)
You need to practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it's gonna be a little awkward.
The engine is so loud that you get deaf when you get out of the car. (But it's cool.)
It's too big, it's too narrow in a regular parking space, and I'm afraid it's going to be knocked over when the next car opens the door!
A little lonely, because there are no rivals on the road.
Don't get me wrong, this video is not for sale. Sorry!

Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times-Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of teaching concepts and values that have accumulated over a long period of time in the course of a university &apos; s development. It is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present day, the university spirit has been essential to political, economic, cultural, scientific, and social development, and even to the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has borne a unique mission that differs from that of other social organizations. In the case of China's universities, which emerged in the autumn of national distress, their spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the values of "Min De Jie Shi, Shu Zi Zhi Ping" and the patriotic responsibility of "enhancing a strong nation through education".
At present, the informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly evident, and the global competition in education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying. As an important "supply side", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the General Programme for the Integrated Advancement of World-Class Universities and the Construction of World-Class Subjects demonstrates China &apos; s confidence and determination to move from a large country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, while at the same time placing higher and new demands on the development of universities.
How can we accelerate our efforts to become world-class in a relatively short period of time, building on the gaps that still exist, and “overtaking the curve” with a few world-class universities and disciplines?
In addition to being firmly confident in their goals, paths and capabilities, universities should also make full use of their three advantages: first, the advantage of being a latecomer, which allows them to continuously bring in outstanding academic talents from abroad, learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities, and significantly improve their academic standards and quality of teaching; second, the cultural advantage, which allows them to inherit the wisdom accumulated over 5,000 years of Chinese civilization, promote the development of excellent traditional culture, and thus consolidate their strength, shape their brand and improve their image; and third, the institutional advantage, which allows them to make full use of the systemic superiority of socialist countries, strengthen goal-orientation, unite consensus and strength, and optimize resource allocation, thus providing sustainable and solid guarantees for universities to accelerate catching up with the world &apos; s advanced levels.
In particular, it should be borne in mind that world-class universities cannot be built on the basis of a single model, and that each school must develop its own personality and identity while building on its strengths.
The characteristics of school management should not only reflect the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect each school &apos; s unique objectives, school management traditions and resource endowment.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three characteristics in the management of the university: first, highlighting the development of innovative entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated educational environment that integrates science, education, and business, and forming a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, highlighting the cross-disciplinary gathering characteristics, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, creating a cross-disciplinary institutional environment, and actively nurturing cross-new and emerging disciplines and iconic cross-disciplinary results; third, highlighting the management system and social service characteristics, carrying out in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industrial, academic, and research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important that the University &apos; s spirit remains intact and resonates with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto "Seek Truth and Innovation," the shared values of "Study Diligently, Practice Virtue, Discern Clearly, and Be True," and the motto "River of Hainan, Inspire Genuine Virtue, Open the Doors to the People, and Build My Country" together constitute the latest expression of Zhejiang University's spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of schooling, continuously accumulate a high level of culture, and cohesive spiritual power, which is rich in content and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, “Hainan River” emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, and embodies the philosophy of “the best talents in the world are for my use” as a way of drawing on the high-quality philosophy of world-renowned universities for the education and upbringing of people; “Inspired by True Virtue” emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, and refers to the fact that universities, while pursuing truth, should also be enriched by virtue and strengthened by personality; “Open to the People” embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the quest for new knowledge and innovation in scientific research, and is expressed as reform and development, and revolution and renewal; “Building My Country” emphasizes the spirit of patriotic dedication, and says that universities should always share in the glory and shame of the nation’s destiny.
This series of spiritual philosophy and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
“The deaf hear in silence, the blind see in invisibility.”
China &apos; s universities should further build on the overall framework of the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the contemporary position of higher education and the historical mission it shoulders, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we will adhere to humanistic concern and independent freedom, allowing the university spirit to vibrate with the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus for achieving national prosperity and renewal, and realizing the common ideals of mankind.

While NFTs are booming, a new concept is emerging in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to earn a steady income in the game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet-raising game that combines NFTs with a variety of gameplay, and is currently the highest-volume NFT project, with more than $3 billion in transactions to date.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity earned more than $8.2 million a day, placing it right next to King's Bounty.
On August 6, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of Axie Infinity is spreading a new "palytoearn" model to more people, where, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single player, but can participate in the governance of the game ecosystem, in addition to enjoying the fun and economic benefits of the game.
This subjectiveness is not granted by the game makers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I read a piece of news about a friend's stock price, I was most impressed by the choice of enterprises in the race, that is, the choice of industries to be invested in. First, choose industries with large growth space, at least 100 billion or more in market size; secondly, choose industries with good future growth, considering the best state of industry growth in the next 3-5 years; and finally, choose industries with policy support.
The width of the racetrack indicates the size of the market, the length of the racetrack indicates the stage of development of the industry, and whether the racetrack is flat or hilly indicates the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheers to the right track!
In the new year, the first thing to do is take stock of 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
The tactic is to “do the things right.”
The strategy is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about direction, tactics are about landing, and there is room for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue deepening in the current area or extending into horizontal areas (strategic thinking); on improving customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on improving activity engagement (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and targeting refreshments; on improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin celebrated several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador made bitcoin a legal currency, making it the first time that bitcoin has become a legal currency in a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of a Bitcoin ETF by ProShares on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time in eight years, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to enter the U.S. capital markets and further expanding crypto exposure.
From the standpoint of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden on transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups complain about enrollment discrimination at Yale and three other Ivy League universities-Xinhua News Agency
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice on May 23, alleging that three Ivy League universities -- Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College -- discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian Education Coalition, which led the petition, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, Zhao Yuqun, chairman of the group, said that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to top American universities has increased exponentially, but the proportion of Asians in the three top American universities has remained essentially at the same level.
A number of studies have shown that these universities “persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants” in the so-called “comprehensive consideration” recruitment process.
Zhao Yuqun explained that a 2014 study by Sanders et al. showed that Asians had the lowest admission rates of all ethnicities relative to the number of applicants at these three universities.
Data from the United States Department of Education also show that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students of all Ivy League universities, and that Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yuqun told Xinhua that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice would be able to conduct an investigation and, once the facts were established, take measures to stop the universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in enrollment.
They also hoped that the universities complained of would take a proactive approach to the issue and change their policies regarding enrolment of Asians.
At present, the three universities complained against have not responded.
The Asian Education Coalition was founded in 2015, after a complaint of enrollment discrimination at Harvard University was rejected by the U.S. Department of Education on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the petition also included educational groups of Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani-American origin.

In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory with Mr. Lin, a member of the family of the owner of the house, and the same day transferred 200,000 yuan by bank transfer as a deposit.
Mr. Lin signed the &quot; Conditions for the Receipt of the Deposit for the Purchase and Sale of the Factory &quot; as the recipient of the payment, which stated that &quot; if the buyer does not wish to purchase the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not wish to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double amount. The parties agreed to conclude the contract for the purchase and sale of the factory within one week. &quot;
However, the parties subsequently failed to reach agreement on the main contractual terms, such as the scope of the sale of the factory and the method of payment, which led to long delays in the signing of the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering that the parties could not agree on the content of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
The seller did not sell the house, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry. The house was not easy to look at, the deposit was paid, and the house was ready, and it was only a step away from signing the contract.
Accordingly, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Lin at the Yuyao City People &apos; s Court.
The court held that the failure of the parties to conclude a formal contract could not be attributed solely to the defendant and that it was reasonable to assume that the negotiations had failed. Therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case and the defendant should not be liable for a double return of the deposit.
Following the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the Court of Second Instance upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer Reminder] Take the necessary due diligence in the transaction.
When entering into a contract, the buyer must exercise the necessary due diligence, such as verifying the ownership of the house, whether the house is occupied, etc., and specifying the time and place of delivery in the contract, in order to avoid disputes between the parties in the performance of the contract.
(Deutsche Welle) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Saturday (December 11) saying that the US holding the "Leadership Democracy Summit" is "drawing ideological lines, instrumentalizing and weaponizing democracy, acting against democracy in the name of false democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and shifting domestic contradictions."
According to the Chinese government, "for a long time, the US has imposed its own political system and values, pursued 'democratic transformation,' imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions,' with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long since become a 'weapon of mass destruction' for US interference in other countries.
The summit was Biden’s fulfilment of his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video link, and 111 leaders from around the world were invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the US, citing problems with America’s own democracy and arguing that the US was not qualified to host such a summit.
And there have been voices of skepticism, both internationally and within the US, such as criticism of the inclusion of authoritarian leaders from countries like the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, and suspicions that the Biden administration’s real intention was to organize the summit for geopolitical rather than democratic purposes.
Newly elected German Chancellor Scholz also attended the Video Democracy Summit
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "the pathology of today's American-style democracy is evident, with money politics, identity politics, political partisanship, political polarization, social rifts, racial conflicts, and the division between rich and poor," and that American democracy is a "game of the rich" based on capital.
In his speech, US President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the defences of democracy, push for reform, and achieve transparent and accountable governance that is more resistant to the forces of tyranny and those who seek to pursue power nakedly over the public good."
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted, "we must renew it in every generation, and in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "face ongoing and worrying challenges, and democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The United States, for its part, has committed itself to following up this Democracy Summit with a one-year initiative that includes a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and to support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete, public commitments to improving their democracies ahead of the Entire Democracy Summit, scheduled for the end of 2022.
"Let all of us implement our commitments and report next year on the progress we have made," Biden said.
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent it to the wrong address.

Education Thoughts: How University Examinations Can Make "Academic Champions" and "Academic Suckers" Each Get What They Deserve - Xinhua News Agency
Three students at Lanzhou University of Transportation wrote to the head of the university, reflecting their confusion about the university exams, and requested that the exams be made more difficult and that the type of questions be changed, so that the exams truly reflect the actual level of the students.
Indeed, university exams have long been a “hot topic.”
On university campuses, students come from all corners of the world, with varying levels of ability and learning experience.
It is inevitable that there will be different perceptions when assessing a group with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the examination questions are of a single type, with a high rate of repetition, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different perception.
Students who do not have to work hard may be able to pass the examination if they concentrate on it immediately before the examination, and if they think of other ways, they may be able to achieve the same result.
As a result, there is a “strange situation” in which “bad students” who don’t work hard can pass, and even get high grades; and “good students” who never miss a lesson, do their assignments and notes well, and don’t score much higher on exams.
It appears that the students of Lanzhou University have a good reason to complain about the problems in the university exams, and I am sure that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou University.
In this sense, the three students who wrote the letters are to be commended for their frankness.
In fact, anyone who has ever attended a university knows that it is not uncommon for students to prepare for exams in a hurry, to try to “steal” assignments from teachers in various ways, to try to get into the examination scope, and to seek “focused tutoring” before the examination. It is not even unusual for students to take notes during the examination and ask teachers to raise their hand after the examination.
In the view of the author, as a way of evaluating the quality of teaching, the success or failure of a university examination depends more on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific assumptions on which it is based.
At the university undergraduate level, specializations begin to be segmented, with many specialized courses focusing on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, a comprehensive mastery of the fundamentals of a subject is what is tested in university exams.
Undergraduate knowledge, on the other hand, is basically the basic theory of the subject and basic common sense. From the point of view of knowledge, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As one teacher put it, “The basics of university mathematics, learned 20 years ago, are still being taught, and are still the focus.”
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the exam is a single type of question or that the questions are repeated.
In many universities, the exams are generally organized into groups of questions, which are then compiled by senior teachers of the subject, and the exams are read by all the teachers of the subject, thus to some extent overcoming the problem of duplicate questions.
However, in order to formulate a set of tests that are consistent with teaching and learning practice, the questions are based on the overall situation of student learning, and are easily normally distributed. It is also necessary to comprehensively master the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of student learning, so that the examination proposal has a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and type of questions, both highlighting the basic knowledge examination and taking into account the ability examination, while innovatively designing the type of questions.
Examinations are the driving force of university education, and students will have corresponding preparation programmes based on the type of examination. In the long run, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou University attaches great importance to students &apos; letters of recommendation and has implemented corrective programmes throughout the university.
All educational units are required to organize teachers to conduct discussions and self-examinations at the end of the course, to develop exam questions and related systems, and to strengthen supervision and inspection of exam questions and the review process, to refine the assessment of results, and to strengthen comprehensive evaluation of all aspects of course teaching.
Mechanically solve the single type of test, duplicate questions and other problems are the university exams need to face the issue, of course, need to introduce a corresponding system, but it is more important in everyday life, requires teachers to comprehensively master the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student learning situation, both ends eat through, teaching and learning will be better matched, forming a beneficial interaction, the exam will be more practical, so that the "superstar" and "bad student" each have their place.
If it is not possible to change the location of the branch for me, can it be changed to an out-of-town location?

The photographer is also very humorous and enjoys taking pictures all day long.
When choosing photos, because I saw a lot of cases on the Internet, do not want to let guests delete too many photos, but when we choose photos, really, not mean to us to add photos, directly package of 24 photos, not a single (heard about my cousin shoot wedding photos almost the same time, seven thousand package and more than a thousand photos, I was amazed, and I was afraid I would choose too much)
I saw two pictures that weren't very good, and they immediately helped me retouch them.
When I looked at the photos my sister had taken before, I was really pleased with our photos. They were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
We sincerely recommend everyone to take a wedding photo of Mrs. Sun Han-kin!
Price: 3999 yuan

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah no birth paper Internet counterfeit paper out of stock
The Sabah National Registry Office said that since the beginning of October, it has not been able to issue birth certificates to newborn babies due to the exhaustion of stocks of special forgery-proof paper, with a cumulative number of 3,200 affected so far.
However, the Director of the Bureau, Kairouaninus, assured that all babies who had applied for birth papers had been recorded in the system and would be re-issued when the forgery-proof papers arrived next week.
At the press conference, he gave explanations in response to an online media report that the issue of printing birth certificate paper in Sabah lasted for 10 months.
He said that the problem had arisen two months earlier and that Sarawak was facing the same problem.
“One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the pandemic, which has led to delays in shipments to our country.”
He explained that Sabah newspapers were printed on a different type of counterfeit-proof paper than was used in other areas, and that it was therefore not possible to borrow stocks from other states.
The latest batch of counterfeit-proof paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6 January and was handed over to the printing company for partial printing on 8 January, Keruaminus said.
“The Bureau will be sending a team to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to collect the documents and return to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing, which is expected to be completed within two more business days (December 20).”
"We will notify the applicants to go to the branches to collect the birth paper."
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
From 7 o'clock more to now
Isn't that almost there?
I &apos;m talking about food.
I'll be right across from #PRS_ORG#
Okay, thank you. The restaurant says it's ready.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set up "buffer zone" State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issues letter to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities-Xinhua News Agency
Beijing, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in port cities, requiring people leaving land border port cities (except those with ports connected to Hong Kong and Macau) in the near future to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and people traveling to land border port cities to undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the circular, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date of determination and public announcement of the scope of port cities by the provinces, districts and municipalities until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the circular also suggests that port cities that meet the conditions may study the establishment of epidemic control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to officials from the National Health Commission &apos; s Disease Prevention and Control Department, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of some port cities, and people from both sides of the border travel frequently.
The implementation of a policy of differential management by subdivision and the change from one line of defence to two lines of defence to prevent and control outbreaks is expected to move the threshold forward, reduce the risk of outbreaks, and achieve maximum effectiveness in preventing and controlling outbreaks with minimal social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, China has experienced a number of local outbreaks, all of which were imported from abroad through port cities.
According to the above-mentioned circular, this revealed that some local epidemic surveillance early warning was not timely, closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions was not implemented, regular nucleic acid testing was carried out in a formal manner, cold chain items were not destroyed at all stages, centralized isolation sites were not properly managed, and emergency response to the epidemic was not sufficiently scientific and accurate.
The circular requires that efforts be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanisms in port cities, strengthening the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, in order to expeditiously remedy the deficiencies and weaknesses in epidemic prevention and control in port cities.
The circular emphasizes that port cities should simultaneously study and deploy work on epidemic prevention and control and public welfare protection, publish and make public welfare protection hotlines accessible, regularly check the supply and prices of basic commodities and other potential risks, and promptly solve and proactively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the public.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include open roads, waterways, air ports located in the county (city, district, flag), city (county, state, union) and municipality under direct administration, the specific scope of which is determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality under direct administration) according to the epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.

The truth about the U.S. military's 20 years of bloodthirsty killing - Xinhua News Agency
(Video source: Pipeline)
On 11 December, a pipeline platform microdocumentary entitled &quot; The Killing Machine &quot; attracted widespread attention.
The film tells how the United States launched the war in Afghanistan in the name of “counter-terrorism” and exported American-style democracy through the war. For 20 years, the poor soldiers used weapons, became bloodthirsty, killed innocent people indiscriminately, and committed various crimes against humanity.
They have used drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian sites, distort human nature and set up killing squads.
For 20 years, US forces have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has “black jails” where “suspects” are subjected to torture and physical humiliation.
One crime against humanity provokes the hatred of many more Afghans.
As the video puts it, the US-style war “against terror” is “the worse the worse.”
The war did not bring the Afghan people the hope of peace, democracy and prosperity, but only a ravaged country and countless deaths and destruction.
Let’s unmask the truth behind the bloodthirsty killing of Americans in the name of “anti-terrorism” and the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
Inadvertently see the following article, from the commercial point of view and the point of view of the preservation period, talk about why the customer wants the logistics company in the customs zone to help canning, although canning is deep processing, not within the scope of operation of the customs logistics company, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers, I touched a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials are the same for both pouches and cans, and there is no difference.
So why is the shelf life of a pouch one year and that of an earpiece two years or more?
Or, why is there such a big price difference between headphones and earphones?
In fact, starting from this point, many consumers, or mom-level believe that it is because the raw materials are not the same, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers out of this mindset after eating reaction also said that the sound of the taste or taste is not the same!
Now let me tell you the reason for the expensive, where is it?
Why are their raw materials the same, but their prices so different?
Most manufacturers set their prices on the assumption that if the price of the bag is too high, the consumer will not accept it, which means that the manufacturer will make little or no profit. On what will the manufacturer survive?
So they have a large increase in the pricing of the hearing aids to secure their profit margins.
As a result, most manufacturers are promoting headphones rather than pouches.
And you think so many manufacturers every year advertising costs tens of millions or even billions, where does this cost come from?
You can imagine.
Then, with the development of society, market promotion costs, such as: promotional personnel in the mall, the exhibition cost of the mall, the cost of product gifts, advertising costs, etc. are also constantly increasing.
So manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and the sound, the price is also constantly rising, in fact, it is with the increase in market costs and new products.
The main objective is to obtain higher profits, but in fact their raw material costs will increase by no more than 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, do not hesitate to link up with doctors in hospitals, allowing them to assist in the promotion of products, making a profit ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per listen.
China’s relevant laws do not allow such practices, which are in fact a fraud against consumers.
It is recommended that if you have a jar at home, you should buy a bag of milk powder and put it in a jar. This will save money and increase the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, which will not have any effect on young children.
Also, do not think that the shelf life of the hearing aid is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of the hearing aid is the same as the bag after unpacking, just say that the bag is not easy to store after unpacking, and is prone to moisture deterioration.

Don't scare people off at the start line-Xinhua
A visit to a book fair often reveals a boom in the sale of successful academic books.
Many of today’s books on success advocate “best practice” – assuming or implying that you can “do” something, and then telling you “what” you need to do.
"How to do it" is the most important and fundamental part.
That’s why they all have one thing in common: either you do your best, or you don’t do anything; either it’s 100, or it’s 0; either you climb Mount Everest, or you stay where you are.
This “best principle” is universally “right,” but 99% of people are scared at the start line.
Because this theory advocates a path of “determination, re-humanization, and a 180-degree turn,” which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
To shout “you need to change” in the ears of those who hold onto the status quo, follow the old ways, and reject change is to play the devil with the devil’s trumpet.
The vast majority of people are intimidated by the word “transition,” or they take the courageous first step in a moment of impulse, but often the momentum is short-lived, and the transition is not sustained.
This “universal humanity” is most eloquently expressed in Mr. Masaryk’s famous “From Tomorrow On.”
The biggest problem with the “best principle” is that the threshold is too high, often beyond the ability of ordinary people, leaving the vast majority “staring at the door.”
Perhaps the “second best” principle is a path that could put more ordinary people on the path to relative success.
At its core, the “second best” principle is “lowering the threshold” – encouraging a theory that says that if you can’t do 100, you can do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; and if you can’t climb Mt. Everest, you can climb the small dune at your doorstep, because it’s always better than standing there.
In short, it is better to do something than not to do anything.
As the threshold is significantly lowered, there is more room for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as they do so, the likelihood of success increases.
The road to success is only a little longer for those who follow the “second best” principle.
In short, the “best” principle, while ostensibly designed to make everyone successful, ultimately motivates only a few; the “second-best” principle motivates many more, and benefits as many as possible.

0.71 million tons of carp reserves in Qinghai Lake increased this year-Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, Dec. 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters from the Qinghai Provincial Agriculture and Rural Affairs Office learned that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year compared to the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial period of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp commonly known as "Huang fish", is unique in Qinghai Lake precious fish species, to maintain the Qinghai Lake basin "water-fish-bird" ecosystem safety and biodiversity has an important role.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply as a result of large-scale human capture and killing and the increasing degradation of the environment in the breeding waters. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake amounted to only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, it was listed as endangered in the Chinese Red List of Endangered Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented closed-lake fish farming, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and products thereof.
At the same time, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year, thanks to measures such as artificial breeding and release, cleaning the main rivers entering the lake, and designing scientifically reasonable "fishing passages".
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Agricultural and Rural Administration, said that up to now, nearly 180 million fish have been artificially bred and released in Qinghai Lake, with a contribution rate of more than 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources.
The Qinghai Three Rivers Source Region is an important ecological barrier and water storage area not only in China but also in Asia, and Lake Qinghai is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers and Lake Qinghai, protect aquatic wildlife, and preserve the biodiversity of the Qinghai Plateau, Qinghai has issued notices banning fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Lake Qinghai since this year, and has established a comprehensive management system banning fishing in “one river, one river, and one lake”.

The restaurant only gave me a bag, so I put it in the bag. It's cold.
I'm just wondering, is it packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I'm wondering if it was leaked or someone took it from us. Thanks.

"I don't know.
Most girls suddenly experience their first menstrual period sometime between the ages of 13 and 15, and stop menstruating around the age of 50.
After that, I will come more regularly once a month, depending on my health.
But it is not a regularity that can be accurately predicted, with a tolerance of about a week, which requires preparation in advance, and sometimes luck changes (suddenly a few days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the intensity of pain vary from person to person, from three days to a week. Some women have little bleeding, while others have massive bleeding. Some women don &apos; t react at all, while others are so sore that they need to be taken away by an ambulance.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end, and the only thing that can be done is to suck up the blood with a sanitary napkin or swab to prevent it from spilling onto the clothing chair.
Menstrual pain is mainly due to the secretion of adrenaline, the beginning of the menstrual period has not come and painful period when you hurry up to take ibuprofen can effectively alleviate the pain in the month, painful period after the start of eating no use.
During the premenstrual period, the uterus is filled with blood and adrenaline is released in excess, causing abdominal cramps.
If you're about to have your period, and you're pulling your belly for some reason, you'll basically have your period in two days.
It is best to change the sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Apart from sleeping time, the worst case scenario is to change 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pads. If you add the portion prepared in advance, you may have 50 pads, not one per month.
(Amendment here, sanitary pads do not need to be changed frequently, about five or six hours can be changed once, a maximum of eight hours)
Menstrual hormone haunting may be more moody, ovulation will also be unstable because of hormonal changes in the body, it is very unlucky, the body to make a stumbling block.
But official crime rate data show that women’s ability to control their emotions is still high, and they don’t use emotional issues as an excuse.
It is not only blood that flows, but also the fallout of the uterine lining.
The endometrium is at its thinnest at the end of the menstrual cycle and then gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is like a house. Every month it builds a house (the endometrium thickens) to welcome guests. If the guests do not come, the entire house is demolished (menstrual discharge) and a new house is built the following month, and so on.
Who wants to go through the inconvenience of bleeding 24 hours a day for several days each month for decades, with abdominal pain and back pain?
But you are born because your mother has her period, and your period is to prepare you to live in a house for 10 months when you come into this world for the first time.
In the past, many women &apos; s activities were suppressed, and women were brainwashed by society to think that they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels sick during menstruation, if someone feels that the preparation of a woman's body for childbearing is sick, it should not be said in public. Girls, stand up, don't think like that again. You haven't experienced it, you won't experience it in your life, and men who don't really understand it, don't be so ungrateful and ignorant.
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary pads, they really work.
It's the winter solstice, and it's disappointing to miss a comparison.
To order a separate meal for the children to eat
I hope to see you again soon.
Is it a leak?
Choosing the right foot bath basin can play a good foot health care, today's national beauty editor will answer this question, hope to help friends.
With people's health awareness, foot bath basin is increasingly popular with consumers, the market has emerged a large number of different products, ranging from more than a hundred to a thousand dollars of foot bath basin assorted, giving consumers a wide range of choice.
In the relevant data surface, compared with traditional household appliances, foot bath basin and other health-carrying household appliances sales are booming, but foot bath basin has no special industry standards, so there are certain safety hazards.
"It's too dangerous to bathe your feet in electric water!"
Mr. Lee told reporters that he had recently bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present, but that his father felt tingling in his feet while bathing.
At first, Mr. Lee thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt tingling under his feet.
Mr. Lee tested the electric pen, which lit up, and was surprised to discover that the water in the foot bath was charged.
He subsequently contacted the merchant, whose attitude was good, and Mr. Lee was still unhappy despite the removal of the footbath.
He discovered that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation regarding the maximum temperature setting, which groups of people are suitable, and which materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
In general, however, footbaths do not have to be charged, but it is not excluded that a small number of products are not strictly controlled when they leave the factory.
Therefore, at the time of purchase, choose a partitioned foot bath.
Electricity and water are separated, and there are no security risks.
At the same time, you can test with a stylus at any time.

Hunan Daily, December 10, 2016 (All Media Reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Ean Ean, Correspondent Liu Xiaoling, Photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Exhibition and Xinhua Red Tea Promotion was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the sprint of 100 billion tea industry goal.

Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly by perception, through the reasoning and logic of reason.
Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy, which seeks to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "metaphysical" is taken from the "易经·系辞上传" "metaphysical is called the way, metaphysical is called the instrument", translated by the Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji period) by metaphysic.
The metaphysical branch includes ontology, natural theology, and its extensions.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real beings and which are merely concepts".
Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical foundation, the notion that all phenomena can be explained by natural reason, was proposed by philosophers who supported science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to a method of study that leaves God out of the equation.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of the systematic reflection and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the rules of conduct accepted by a group of people or a culture.
The main subdivisions are metaethics (abstractly studying the essence of ethical theories or criticisms) and normative ethics (judgments of various moral views and recommendations of ethical guidelines for right or wrong behaviour).
It studies what kinds of moral codes of conduct people should follow), applied ethics (the study of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and drawing conclusions from observed patterns).
It examines ethics not from a presupposed theoretical point of view, but by examining the real choices made and observed by actual moral agents, all the moral factors that contribute to that choice, and the ethical notions held by social communities.
The history of ethics includes Greek-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Valls and Montaigne, among others.
Part II: The ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.

To a friend.
I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the humanitarian assistance provided by our friends over the long period of more than 30 years since the death of our loved ones, especially since my personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has been uninterrupted to date.
Today, the parents of the vast majority of the victims have died, and the orphans have grown up and have families and jobs.
It was your generosity that helped our bereaved families through the most difficult of times.
While the COVID-19 pandemic is raging around the world, most donors are retired.
Therefore, I urge you to suspend your humanitarian donations to our rare group, the Tiananmen Mothers, a humanitarian relief effort that should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love, and I am confident that your deeds will go down in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, and I ask my friends to excuse me!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
TAO: Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief overview of the 32-year history of humanitarian aid of the International Federation for Chinese Studies and Solidarity (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the course of its humanitarian aid work, ASLEF and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the executors of projects often intersect.

Aid often fails to reach those in need.
In 1994, he suggested that the Tiananmen Mothers set up a special group to coordinate and be responsible for receiving and distributing humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF established the Six-Four Orphans &apos; Education Fund. Eleven years later, in 2009, after all the Six-Four orphans had graduated from university, the MCDF established the Six-Four Orphans &apos; and Older Persons &apos; Special Needs Assistance Fund, which has been in operation ever since.
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and community donations during the Six Four, from generous individual donations, and from the support of the Fraternity University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Foundation for Rehabilitation Research.
It was not until last year, 31 years later, that the 64 survivors finally received a portion of the funds raised in the name of the 64 from Hong Kong.
During this time, Human Rights in China has also been independently implementing its humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's call to stop donations on June 4 is for the sake of donors, and we are indeed some retired elders whose income is not as good as before retirement, and hereby express our thanks for Mr. Ding's "letter to a friend".
We will respect your decision to terminate this project within two years and to resume it immediately if necessary.
I would also like to express my gratitude and respect to those brave fellow citizens who, over the years, have consistently given generously and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid.

Thank you very much for choosing our products. Before using our chips, please take 5 minutes to read the following carefully:
After opening the box, please check whether the goods are complete.
In the event of any omissions, please contact Customer Service immediately.
The top cover of the microfluidic chip is made of PC, do not allow solvents to react chemically with the PC.
Do not use a hand-held syringe to fill the chip directly, as this can lead to leakage.
Common substrate microfluidic chips are tested in pure water at 500 mbar (100um channel depth) or 300 mbar (50um channel depth) before shipment.
The glass substrate chips are tested with pure water under 800mbar (100um channel) sample pressure before shipment. When using glass substrate chips, please be careful not to collide with sharp objects, otherwise the substrate will be damaged.
During use, consider the viscosity of the solution and do not exceed this range, otherwise it will cause leakage.
We recommend a flow rate of less than 150ul/min for normal substrate microfluidic microchips and less than 50ul/min for oil phase microfluidic microchips when the injection pump is filled with pure water.
Increase your flow rate parameters from slow to fast depending on the viscosity of the actual filling liquid.
Universal chip, after the experiment is completed, please clean the internal channel in a timely manner, otherwise it is easy to cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumable and cannot be reused over a long period of time.
If the chip is damaged due to long-term use or improper operation, it will not be replaced.
If you need a microfluidic chip that can handle higher pressures or flow rates, please contact customer service for customization.

Thank you for the review of the rabbit was also said to reject the old style is not suitable for the old style did not think that the finished product is simply too beautiful.
Thank you for your endorsement, Mr. Dandan. Your satisfaction will give us the energy to move forward, and we will continue to do so!
This photography studio is amazing and highly recommended for all the kids!
From the reception, make-up, costumes, lighting, photography to the final stage, everything was flawless.
Make-up artists are particularly delicate, they will match your makeup according to your style, and the cosmetics used are all first-rate brands.
I don't need to tell you, it's pretty professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better studios in Beijing need to be queued up six months in advance. My colleague shot in Beijing, and after watching the film, he thought it was just so so.
This studio, a place with a soul and an attitude, was chosen deliberately.
Our facial expressions are poorly managed, and I think this is also the short version of most people.
Makeup artists, photographers, post-production, a great team.
We and the people around us can't help but praise it.
I had already recommended it to my girlfriend, and she was just as delighted when she saw the film.
It is to be hoped that such studios will not be buried, and that more people will discover ta and shoot in their own style, rather than in a uniform one.
Thank you very much for the five-star review, both of you are very thoughtful, creative newcomers, we are the creative studio, as long as the customer likes us, we will do our best to complete, thank you for meeting.
The sweet and caring assistant, and the lively photographer teacher, everyone in the team were super nice It was a wonderful shooting, a very memorable experience, and the effects of the shooting were much better than I imagined Everyone worked hard, thank you very much 😘😘
Thank you so much for your review. It's a blessing to meet you. From Hue to Qinhuangdao, your trust in us is the distance of thousands of kilometers. I'm so happy to meet you.

I'm gonna get a phone call from the restaurant right now.
A programmer who wants to share his personal experiences.
If you intend to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you do not have this idea, it is better to study yourself, after all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes six months to learn.
But training is indeed a very good option if you intend to get into this business, especially for those who are self-controlled and self-conscious.
If you have a strong self-discipline, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, it is necessary to look at the strength of the teachers of the institution. If the strength of the teachers is not strong enough, the training institution will have little meaning. Of course, the strength of the teachers of some newly opened training institutions is not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing to investigate the training institution, it is best to investigate the students out of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution knows exactly how the institution, the course is good or bad.
Hello, I don't know how to answer your question, because I don't know your personal situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your personal situation.
For example, your specialty, your age, the language you want to learn, and even the city in which you want to study or work.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or computer specialized has graduated, then if time is sufficient, I personally recommend self-study, this is the most efficient and cost-effective, now there are many off-line on-line training institutions are actually very good, but a high learning cost, two more time investment, basically need concentrated training 3-6 months.
But if I say these situations, self-study is very convenient, now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or go to b site also have a lot of training resources, if you do not look for resources, you can also contact me through the profile, obtain free resources, or detailed advice is fine.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video integrated learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can afford to pay a certain amount of money and time to learn, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn, so that learning is not very hard, the teacher also explains in detail, questions are also answered by someone specialized, and it is also helpful in planning or supervision of learning.
And now a lot of training institutions will sign an employment agreement, with internal nominations, after studying recommended to the company, so that later to find a job interview can also save a lot of things.
These are some of my thoughts, the previous because I do not know your situation, so only roughly introduced and not detailed, if you have other want to consult, you can contact me at any time to exchange communication.
I said before 1:00. I saw it on the app.

My daily work
- Your request, my service.
Service with a heart, clean with a heart, stay good.
You care about the details, FengGue housekeeping help you do "clean" as I can, service love.
Keep all homes clean, set up housekeeping signs, provide services in place, and keep homes clean.
Cleaning in and out, my daily routine.

We can only succeed if we do things with our hearts, and we are serious when it comes to tailoring.
Give me a chance, I will make you satisfied, quality says everything, because professionalism deserves to be trusted, your approval is my greatest encouragement!
It's not a good time to do business!
But I always believed that as long as I was serious, persistent, and hard-working, I would be better than anyone else, at least better than sitting around complaining!”
The plan of the day lies in the morning, and all good things begin in the morning. I wish you happiness, good luck, health, and good will to start the new day, and to remain in good spirits throughout the day. Good morning.
As a child, happiness is a thing, and it is happiness to have it; as a grown-up, happiness is a goal, and it is happiness to achieve it; and as a mature person, one discovers that happiness is a state of mind, and it is happiness to realize it.
Be the most authentic and the best you can be, act from the heart, and do not regret this life. There is only one path in life, follow your own path. There are two treasures in life: a good body, a good spirit, and a beautiful and bright life to the old age!
Each stage of life presents different challenges.
Often, it is not the ability that limits you, but the courage to face it positively.
If it cannot be avoided, it should be faced.
The more you fear, the more you will be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face them, they will eventually be solved.
China and Saudi Arabia Collaborate to Organize Saudi Arabia's First Contemporary Art Biennial-Xinhua
Riyadh, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's first biennial of contemporary art, the Diriyah Biennial of Contemporary Art, officially opened to the public on Dec. 11 at the Diriyah JAX art district in the northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
This biennial exhibition is jointly organized by the Fondation de la Biennale de la Chartreuse and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with the curator of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, Feiyu Ti, serving as artistic director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of the biennial exhibition is "touching the rock across the river", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of socio-economic transition, and also reflects the current situation of socio-cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
Covering nearly 12,000 square meters, the exhibition spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six modules: Touching the Stone, Crossing the River, Legacy as Experiment, Thinking on the Edge, Reaching the Public, A Beautiful New World, and The Spirit of Art.
The works of 27 Saudi artists comprise more than 40% of the exhibition, covering painting, installation, and performing arts. The works of 12 Chinese artists have also attracted considerable attention, with some artists using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Ying, who reconstructed a classic mountain landscape from rubbish in her series Behind the Story of Unfinished Mountains (2014).
Mr. Barkley, Chief Executive Officer of the Dirar Biennial Foundation, said he hoped that the biennial would create international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia &apos; s thriving cultural industries and creative communities and to enhance interaction.
“The aim of the biennial is twofold: to bring Saudi contemporary art into the global dialogue, and to integrate Saudi audiences into the contemporary art world,” Ti said.
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the biennial, where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as intercultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Integrated Regulation of Rural Public Benefit Job Management-Xinhua
Kunming, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- In order to continuously improve employment support for people emerging from poverty and consolidate the results of poverty eradication efforts, the Yunnan Province recently issued a policy on the management of publicly beneficial jobs for the promotion of rural revitalization, contributing to the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization.
According to officials from the Yunnan Provincial Office of Human Resources and Social Affairs, at present, Yunnan has created a total of 448,300 rural public-benefit jobs for the employment of rural disadvantaged groups, such as the labour force that has emerged from poverty. These jobs play an important role in helping people emerge from poverty by increasing their employment and income, consolidating the results of the fight against poverty, and effectively improving the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments, including the Yunnan People &apos; s Social Welfare Department, the Department of Rural Revitalization and the Department of Finance, and are mainly aimed at harmonizing the scope of targets for grass-roots recruitment for rural public-benefit positions, the management of funds, the development of positions and the management of positions.
In the area of job development and creation, the new regulations are clear and set up according to the principles of “job creation according to demand, employment based on job, dynamic management, and total control,” “who develops, who uses, and who is responsible,” and “one person per job, voluntary disclosure, and unified management.”
The recruitment procedure must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, notification, approval, public notice, recruitment, pre-employment training and on-the-job training.
In addition, the new regulations clarify the specific responsibilities of the main departments responsible for the development of rural public service jobs, the subsidy standards for rural public service jobs and the forms of subsidy. They stipulate that each department responsible for the development of rural public service jobs shall purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for persons placed in rural public service jobs, and require the relevant departments to regularly monitor the distribution of rural public service job subsidies.
Wrong address.
Hello.
Possibility of cancellation of orders
I'll order again.
Has it been cancelled?
2. Although the right wing has had a period of success in its history, it has not lasted long, and the reason for its short life is that a little sunshine makes it shiny, and a little hot water makes it sweat.
But, to be honest, the right has played a positive role in social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements and have great respect for him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social problems seriously.
But I disagreed with his anti-Communist doctrine, arguing that anti-necessary revolution inevitably leads to social turmoil, the destruction of people’s livelihoods, a mixture of political groups, and foreign interventions.
4. To change or improve China, it is necessary to have patience and an attitude of responsibility for the country and its people. Those who try to take advantage of political speculation are not right-wingers, but bastards.
Then talk to the left.
The Left is a bunch of outcasts of time and politics.
If the right has a positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's speeches and analyze their ideas when necessary, then the left does not have it, because what the left wants is exactly the rubbish that the Communist Party throws away!
5. Recently, I have seen some of my friends rebuke the thieves while rebuking the leftists, and I am quite moved by this, but I don't think it is necessary.
Don't try to argue with the Chinese and the leftists, they're all the same, and there's no reason to argue with them.
And don't try to prove that we're right, let alone try to get anti-terrorists and leftists to acknowledge it, why should we?
This is what I say to my friends: when the anti-terrorists insult you, when the leftists insult you, it proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people also had ideals when they were young and forgot them when they grew older, or pursued them but became paranoid.
The ideals are gradually abandoned, and even the young dragon-slayer turns into an evil dragon.
Left and right I think generally refers to restraint and freedom, China from the historical culture of innate genes lead to China as a whole should be left-wing.
At home, the right is liberal and focuses on efficiency and development, while the left is more regulatory and focuses on fairness and security.
Now that society as a whole wants to focus more on equity, and China and the US are competing, the shift to the left is certain to continue for many years to come.
Even if you don't understand, just like it.
I don't say anything. It's just the way it is.
In the past two years, the U.S. embargo and blockade of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused “US-based” companies to suffer huge losses.
The U.S.-led embargo on China's chip industry, which requires its own enterprises and allied countries related enterprises to simultaneously blockade China's chip industry, has directly led to the orders and profits of global chip suppliers being affected, causing the R & D investment of chip manufacturing enterprises to decrease, and the production capacity to decrease, thus causing the disorder of the shortage of the chip supply chain on a global scale.
Today, the “chip shortage” has affected all major industries around the world, from automakers that have halted production to mobile phone makers that have seen their prices rise. Almost every industry that uses a chip has been affected.
In an effort to regain “chip” sovereignty, technology giants in an increasing number of countries are embarking on a path of “de-embellishing.”
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control, hinder the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, the United States recently moved frequently, and chaired the "chip summit"; and invited 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and supported US domestic technology giants, for example, Intel, a long-standing technology giant, to regain its leading position in the chip field, spent $ 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in the US state of Arizona, and opened up chip subcontracting business.
While most people think that Intel's move will cause a certain impact on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., and is likely to steal Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s "breadbasket".
This is because Intel, as a long-standing technology giant, has been deeply involved in the field of semiconductors for decades, has a large number of talented teams and technology reserves, and will certainly rise quickly in the short term, beating Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
However, Intel’s decision was not taken lightly by the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Chung-Wei Zhang.
At the "2021 Masters Think Tank Forum" held in April, Zhang was surprised. With regard to Intel's investment in building a wafer factory, Zhang said without hesitation: Intel's construction of a chip factory is quite ironic.
Zhang’s resentment of Intel’s entry into the chip business stems from a 30-year-old grudge between Zhang and Intel.
During the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of American manufacturing, the world’s leading semiconductor company, and the world’s biggest computer manufacturer.
Until the 1980’s, the world’s high-end semiconductor chips were dominated by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, in which a chip was designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory, and Intel was representative of that era.
But this model is overwhelming for some small firms, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are discouraged by the huge costs of building a production line.
Under the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear the phenomenon of division of labor cooperation, in 1984, hearing that there was a company specializing in chip design, Zhang Chunmu believed that since there was a company specializing in design, then it could be established a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang’s vision became a reality, and Taijiquan was born.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing focused its core business on the single segment of "wafer processing", not designing, but only providing subcontractor services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, the newly founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was small compared to the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Chuanmu had sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing was only involved in the manufacturing sector of the chip industry, it was obvious that it had a very high self-esteem, disregarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and resolutely refused to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
At the time, Intel wasn't looking at wafer processing services.
It is not surprising that the giant of wafer manufacturing services did not look at it at the time, but now it is also starting to be a wafer subcontractor.
So, Zhang finds it ironic that Intel is entering the wafer subcontracting business.
Today, the market value of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has exceeded that of Intel.
Faced with the strong offensive of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel naturally does not dare to hold its ground.
Today, TSMC is rushing toward 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm, as it was seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: the February 2008 rise in the price of gold, the rise in the price of goods, and the rise in the price of goods and services. The spread of public opinion formed a wave peak, followed by an “exponential decline” (the smoothing curve) that eventually dissipated.
They look exactly like the [online opinion evolution model] shown on the NIC website.
What is an abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches randomly selected from the same event, showing [solitary peaks], [serrated] and [cliffs].
The “solitary peak” is an artificial heating, rapidly climbing the top of the hot searches, attracting the attention of the public; the “serrated” is a periodic heating, ensuring that the topic tops the hot search lists; and the “cliff” is a collective withdrawal, the hot search has finished its “function”, received a new task, and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of one event coincides with the trough of another, at the same time, which must have been when the unified group of Marines took over the task of launching a new round of offensives.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attracts attention, which is responsible for popularization, which leads to war, which diverts attention, which affects cognition, which misleads judgments, which incites emotions, which blackmails decision-making, black accounts batch by batch, node by node refinement operation, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread of public opinion dissemination.
Communication is a science, leaving aside all the subjective factors of position, emotions, and objective data alone, black public relations will be nowhere to escape.
Whoever passes by leaves traces, traces that we dig out together.

Omicron strain of COVID-19 detected in Mauritius for the first time - Xinhua News Agency
BEIJING, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi reported their first cases of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus on Dec. 11.
For the first time in the country, two cases of infection with the omicron strain were reported in Mauritius on 10.
According to the Maoist Minister of Health, Kalesh Jagutpal, one of the infected persons was a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on 27 November; the other was a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for nucleic acid on 30 November following contact with a person who had recently travelled to South Africa and returned.
Following treatment in hospital isolation, the nucleic acid results of both infected persons were negative and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on 10 that for the first time in the country, three cases of infection with the Omicron strain were diagnosed.
All three were students who returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not hospitalized as they were mildly ill.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Government of Sierra Leone is steadily increasing its control measures.
From 6 December to 10 January 2021, passengers over the age of 12 entering the country by air will be required to undergo a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health also announced on 10 January that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines would begin to be administered to children aged 5 to 11 in the country.
The Minister of Health of Malawi, Kumbidze Chibunda, said on 9 that for the first time in the country, three cases of infection with the omicron strain were detected.
The country’s health authorities sequenced the genomes of 12 positive COVID-19 samples collected between 9 November and 2 December, and identified the three cases of infection.

360 Integrated Home Furnishing
Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Home, 156 South Ring Road
In the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to look at the beginning of my budget is 70,000 to make a basic renovation.
A series of scams begins in the store.
It was the first time I went to the store just to show them my house plan, they did not go to the field to measure the house, they could actually give me a quote that my 135 house 70,000 can be fixed, probably showed me their materials and did not know what brand of materials they are.
The second trick they use is to drag you into the store and take your deposit (which you can’t withdraw from once you’ve paid it, unless you’ve had enough experience fighting them in a theoretical battle).
When I was hesitant about paying the deposit, they invited their so-called manager to tell you how much we could give you if you paid the deposit today.
This is a great pit, and I am a living example of being deceived, in the moment of impulse, I paid a deposit of more than ten thousand.
The quote he gave me had a lot of problems. 70,000 doesn't include plumbing, doesn't include any doors and cabinets, bathrooms, and those three are the major costs of the basement.
Apart from these, their service point fees are also higher than other companies.
I lost confidence in the company and was forced to sign a contract without any explanation at the outset.
When I went to get my money back, they looked very experienced, with small teams dedicated to dealing with you.
Anyway, it's the customer's problem and they're not responsible for it.
All kinds of shifting responsibility, and there are many details, I do not want to say one by one are tears, in short, do not choose them, because my friend asked them to renovate the house is not good quality, later to count you all kinds of costs.
It's like they're just a bunch of crooks, but now they're pretty, and it's like they're closing down and becoming something else.
So don't choose this crappy renovations company.
Then everyone in the selection of Baidu look at these check these consultations because the renovation is not small money.

It's so awful, I'll cancel the order if I don't get there in 30 minutes!
Is there no other way, such as changing the address?
Okay, then don't cancel this conversation, and if I don't get my money back in 5 to 10 days, I'll go after you.
I asked if I could cancel less than 15 minutes before.
The turkeys were supposed to be cooked, but they got raw meat. They couldn't eat it.

Tianjin, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will be extremely large on December 14.
Gemini meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018, photographed by Anju, an astronomy enthusiast from Beijing.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the Gemini Meteor Shower is caused by 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo asteroid.
The Geminids are also the second meteor shower known not to have been "bred" by a comet.
Shu Lipeng, a member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an astronomy popularization expert, explains that, like the Chinese New Year movie, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "screening period" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is known as one of the three major meteor showers of the northern hemisphere, along with the Quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is the relatively slow velocity of the meteors, rich in colour, and the presence of a number of flares, making it suitable for both visual observation and photography by beginners in astrophotography.
Gemini meteor shower photographed by Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast from Tianjin, in Tianjin Jizhou on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts indicate that this year &apos; s Geminide meteor shower will reach its maximum around 3 p.m. on 14 December, with a maximum ZHR (number of meteors per hour visible under ideal observation conditions when the radiation point is directly above the top of the head) of 150.
Gemini meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the Geminids were impressive, but this year's Geminids will be slightly diminished by the moonlight.
The 14th is the 11th of November in the lunar calendar, the moon is in a crescent phase, the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, and the moon will fall in the second half of the night, at which time the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Those who like meteor showers can observe them during these hours of late night, when the moon is behind, but be wary of the cold.”
How can as many meteors as possible be observed?
"It is not advisable to observe in the city, but rather in the suburbs or in the countryside, at a high altitude, with little light pollution, with an open view facing northeast, and patiently waiting for the moon to set, then visually observing it.
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so it is not necessary to look constantly at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
If you like photography and want to capture a spectacular'meteor shower', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, spare batteries, and shutter cords are also essential for stability and continuity.”
He said.
What are the differences between laser TV and conventional TV in terms of market positioning?
In my understanding, the title says the traditional TV should refer to LCD TV, and laser TV and LCD TV in the market positioning differences, mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared to the full-fledged market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is clearly more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product for large screens.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV size is 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of the laser TV is generally 75 inches or more, and the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TV.
In recent years, laser televisions have been increasing both in terms of shipments and sales globally, accounting for more than 60 per cent of total sales of 80-inch and larger televisions.
In 2020, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140% and continue to grow at a high rate.
Its success in the large-screen market is largely due to its eye-friendly performance.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source is not directed directly into the eyeball, and the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions and less irritating to the eyes than the backlight source of an LCD television.
Ophthalmologists from the Saixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and the Beijing Harmony Hospital conducted a rigorous comparison test of 144 groups of people watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirm that laser televisions do indeed have strong eye-protective characteristics, and in certain respects even ameliorative effects.
In a time when visual health is increasingly important, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye-friendly advantages, but also open up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the price of LCD TV is constantly down, the current market price of laser TV is mostly in the thousand yuan, with the upgrade of size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
There must be a reason.
With the continuous development of light sources and technological levels, laser television has many advantages that LCD television and projection cannot achieve.
Thanks to ultra-short-focal-length projection technology, the projection distance of laser television is shorter than that of conventional projection equipment, enabling a 100-inch large-screen experience at a short distance, with a small footprint and a small host computer.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser televisions can reach over 2,000 lumens.
Combined with lower heat generation and lower equipment losses, the TV has a longer service life.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more stunning audiovisual experience.
Talk about false demand, but the product of demand segmentation, the picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not for video players, want to balance the large screen and viewing environment is insufficient, you can try, everything has its advantages and disadvantages, weigh and judge yourself, just be afraid to listen to the words of one side.
Simply put, ultra-wide-angle near-focus projectors -- laser televisions -- have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors to get close to the screen, which is not optically optimal.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, microstructured veneer screens are used, which are expensive, and the price of an 80-inch screen basically replaces a 65-inch LCD.
One more thing, I particularly hate projection manufacturers take diffuse reflection to the eye good this when selling point, come on, the eyes can see the light on the screen for the eyes is direct light, you reflected on the ceiling, the eyes can not see, even if more true LCD TV is diffuse "direct", turn on the ceiling of the TV is not also illuminated?
Furthermore, a projection screen would not work without diffuse reflection.
It is precisely the heat-spot (light-spot) effect of high-gain screens that is overlooked, where a lot of light is reflected into the eye at one angle, which is really unpleasant.

With the appointment date on Weibo, the younger sister sent me a choice of time schedule, and the response was more timely ~
Before I went, I saw the photography in the store, more of the outdoor wedding dress, it's beautiful, and there are many styles of photography involved.
After the day came, I simply exchanged my thoughts with my sister, and she patiently tried on two sets of clothes in my style, and finally decided to start makeup ~ the photographer would set up some props before shooting, would guide the movements, and would be more careful about the details.
But maybe because they didn't communicate specific shooting ideas with me, it didn't come out in the style I wanted, but it should be pretty.
After the shoot, the photographer will help select the photos, exchange post-production style, it feels very careful.
It'll take about half a month to get it fixed. Wait for the results.
For the second time, I won the photography category of the King's Dinner event ～most of the clothes of the whole event could be chosen for photography.
Finally, choose a black satin dress and experiment with different styles.
The whole shooting process took about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, the photographer responsible for shooting was my 95-year-old brother, I still feel a little young, I hope to give more advice in the future in terms of motion guidance for customer shooting ~ very talkative, the shooting process was pleasant.
The Art of Visual Aesthetic Photography
It's on the front page. Check out Queenie.
To the store first fill in the name and telephone number then choose clothes, wedding dress can be chosen, changed three or four sets of clothes is quite patient, make-up after choosing a long time, service attitude is also good, after shooting will teach you how to make the style, is taken out of the feeling of a big face, refinement said to be half a month, three or four days to send, feels like no difference with the original
The location is good.
There are a lot of options for clothing.
There were about three make-up locations, and inside there was a camera studio.
The staff is very friendly and helpful.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also be very careful to teach you the movements.
If dissatisfied, the photographer will also offer to re-shoot.
[Experience] may be a little over the shape, the original two eyelids were placed out of three eyelids.
The ends of the eyebrows were shaved, a little embarrassed about not drawing eyebrows on a daily basis.
The photo was taken about 10 days ago, but the effect of the P-diagram was not very satisfactory, and it was obvious that the eye patches were still visible.
Because I wasn't sure what style I wanted, I tried on two dresses, and I ended up with a black one. She said it was more Hepburn-esque.
The hairdresser and make-up artist were super patient to help me get out the results are very satisfied.
After I put on my makeup, I started to take pictures. The photographer instructed me how to pose. The whole process was easy and harmonious.
After the shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorite pictures and finished them. My brother said that the film would be finished in 15 days, and the ending was very satisfying.
No reply for 3 days...I can't sign up for the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan because your system doesn't recognize my credit card!
The weirdest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay.
Now I have to pay shipping every time.
Can I get an exemption and wait until you've finished your investigation before I'm charged my monthly fee?
Little umbrella buys insurance. Does it work?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
According to the Insurance Brokerage Regulatory Regulations (2015 Revision), to become an insurance brokerage company, it must meet three key words: shareholders, the initiator has no significant violation record in the last three years, the minimum amount of RMB 50 million can be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Supervisory Commission.
These three are in fact very strict, in summary, is to have strength, to go through the approval of the national authority of the Bank Supervisory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks in the country), shareholders to have good manners, as an insurance brokerage company small umbrella insurance, the policyholder does not need to question too much small umbrella insurance is regular or not, after all, there are these three thresholds, not all insurance companies can reach.
In that respect, it is good and trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star serious illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest listed Hua Thai Super Mary 5th serious illness insurance, claims settlement and insurer are Hua Thai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not question its reliability.
From the contribution model: Internet platform products, because there are fewer operating costs of business locations, and the cost of employee wages, so Internet products generally have a higher price-performance ratio, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payments, alleviating the contribution pressure of the policyholder, while it can maximize the leverage of insurance.
It's very good.
Can be considered.
This is particularly important because insurance is an industry that requires a very high degree of professionalism, and many customers of Internet products can take out insurance themselves. In this case, there will be a lot of errors. In the area of health information and employment, non-insurance practitioners will often add their own subjective awareness when taking out insurance, feeling that they are healthy or fit.
I myself have done insurance telephone sales in "Tencent micro-insurance" (as well as the umbrella, also an internet insurance brokerage platform), very responsible to tell you.
Insurance on the Internet is real and reliable. What is not reliable is the people. Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there is a lot of misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance 60000000, buy insurance for mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 severe illness coverage, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid light, will not tell the insured, the first month 1 yuan, the next month is to be charged at normal rates, ranging from tens to 200, many customers charge a year or two of their own purchase is not clear what.
The insurance company claimed $6 million (a lot of money).
Free mobile phones are only given to those who have special insurance numbers, such as 6666 or 8888, and if a winning text message is sent, the recipient is not reminded to redeem it.
(This is another pit for the insured) free 60,000 severe illness coverage, is short-term, if only on this, no other commercial insurance, in the event of serious illness, 60,000 can do, can not solve the problem, later life begins to run naked.
Misleading insurance sales on the Internet are also being severely punished by the State.
So, overall, there is no problem with the platform, nor with the product, but with the professionalism and professional ethics of the operators.
In fact, many off-line insurance brokerage products are broader, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are better value for money than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers to insure their offline products, saving them 2,000-3,000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I: Minya insurance broker, with more than 3 years of business management training experience, serviced nearly a thousand enterprise users, cooperation with more than 100 insurance companies, before insurance, I will start from the customer needs, tailor-made insurance products for customers, insurance, for customers to compare three companies, strive to achieve the best nuclear insurance results for customers, after insurance, for customers to make insurance policy, insurance policy hosting, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow with each customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer will be helpful to the author!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is an insurance transaction where the policyholder can complete all the insurance process independently by clicking on the link.
In this process, neither the policyholder nor the insurance adviser is required to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder.
While taking out insurance on the Internet is less “ritual,” and may not even involve a paper contract, it does not affect the validity and legal effect of an electronic contract.
This model, somewhat similar to the streamlined operation of "telephone selling," has the fatal problem of purchasing insurance in such a way that the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, shouldn’t we think carefully about whether we’re choosing an “intermediary” that will be with us for many years to come?
How do I get in touch with the waitress?

No problem, remember, no need to arrange re-delivery, I've bought another one, I don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
I have opposed, and continue to oppose, any form of defamation and verbal abuse, let alone such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, as long as we eliminate such scoundrels.
Without regard to political parties and factions, it is this kind of uncivilized behaviour that should be resisted first.
I have taken a non-responsive attitude, starting with your Facebook friend requests, continuing with your sardonic posts, and ending with your attempts to post my alleged home location and father’s name on social media.
Not only did you continue to tag me with the same frequency as six meals a day, but you also continued to discuss some obscure, humiliating statements about me with your so-called friends on Facebook.
I didn't know that later I received several friends to send about your Facebook friends account uploaded a photo of you and sexual harassment statements.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent any longer.
After the news of my report to the police was posted, you did not subdue yourself at all, but became even more arrogant.
I do not care what your political background is, or what your status is, in our society, there is a need for respect for both genders.
Yes, you can continue with your ridiculous, obscure, humiliating, insulting statements, you can continue to say that you only care and care about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your drawing, or you can continue with all of your offensive statements.
Yes, I can't and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to be so humiliated in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, are you all right?
If I say yes, you won't believe me.
I don't think there's any girl who can say she's okay after being bullied like that.
Whether at work, in society, in politics or in business, only those who lack even basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart.
I cut a part of the message to comment.
You shouldn't be able to impersonate yourself on your own posts, right?
I can only say you're an enemy of civilization.
I'm gonna smile.
Vietnamese People's Daily - Prime Minister Phan Minh Chung attends the 3rd National Digital Enterprise Development Forum
During the 3rd Viet Nam National Digital Enterprise Development Forum, two main sessions were held, focusing on digital enterprises and the digital transformation of the country, and digital enterprises and the economic recovery and development during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to Minister of Communications and Media Nguyen Minh Triet, in 2021, despite the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number and revenue of digital technology enterprises in Vietnam maintained growth momentum, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical Vietnamese digital products has grown, focusing on solving the major problems facing Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Minister Nguyen Minh Triet called on digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing national digital transformation platforms, which is a national mission.
At the forum, the leaders of various departments and state agencies, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are researching, developing, applying and transferring digital technologies shared their breakthrough ideas and solutions to mobilize and pool the resources of the whole society to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, jointly promote the digital transformation of the country, and post-pandemic economic recovery.
Speaking at the forum, Prime Minister Fan Mingzhen stressed that digital transformation is the world &apos; s inevitable path and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue and, as it serves everyone, it requires everyone &apos; s participation.
People and businesses are the core, subjects, targets and drivers of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies need to be for people and businesses.
Prime Minister Fan emphasized that digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit, with internal strength as the main, strategic, long-term and decisive factor, and external strength as the important and breakthrough.
At the same time, he believes that digital transformation needs to be driven towards in-depth development and sustainable development, participating in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery and development, responding to subsequent changes, overcoming the depletion of natural resources, and supporting the green transition and development of green energy.
Digital transformation requires participation in the creation of databases for the preservation and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, the country &apos; s landscape and people, and the promotion of digital transformation in areas such as banking, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics.
The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and countries more prosperous.
Prime Minister Fan Mingsheng called on governments, agencies and enterprises at all levels to strengthen leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, raise awareness of digital transformation, continue to develop and improve the system for digital transformation, strengthen state management, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises in a spirit of respect, communication, listening, positive and proactive.

The Yangtze Main Stream Achieves Full Coverage of On-Water Green Integrated Service Area-Xinhua
Wuhan, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- On December 10, the Puling Waterfront Green Integrated Service Zone in Chongqing City was completed and put into operation as scheduled. It is the second waterfront green integrated service zone to be officially opened upstream of the Yangtze River, following the opening of the Luzhou Waterfront Green Integrated Service Zone in Sichuan Province on December 8.
By now, the water-based green integrated service zone has covered the upper, middle and lower Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, said that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces had built and operated 10 on-water green integrated service areas in the middle and downstream of the Yangtze River, which had been widely acknowledged by crews and played an important role in advancing the high-quality development of Yangtze shipping.
The full coverage of the on-water green integrated service area is another milestone in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River, and the capacity for receiving pollution from ships and providing shipping services on the Yangtze River has been significantly improved.
It was introduced that the on-water green integrated service area is an important facility for providing all-round production and life services to a wide range of ships and crews, helping a wide range of crews to solve the "urgent and urgent" problem.
The two on-water green integrated service areas in the upper Yangtze River, which have been built and are now in operation, integrate life services, production services and government services. They are based on the theme of green environmental protection and feature ship maintenance and ship emergency rescue services, enabling ships in the port to be moored once and receive multiple services, which will make the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and their lives more convenient.
Three U.S. Aircraft Carriers Converge Near China, Powerful Weapons Rarely Visit Guam 2022-01-17 多维 多维报道：中美关系最新消息：最新卫星图像显示，三艘美国航母正在集结近中国；美国媒体还披露，美国海军武器库中最强大的武器之一罕见访问关岛，释放重要信号给美国在印度太平洋地区的盟友和敌人。
On January 9, satellites spotted the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Strait of Malacca, according to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank.
The Strait of Malacca, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic point on the first chain of islands in the Western Pacific.
The platform anticipates that the Carl Vinson will be deployed in the South China Sea.
This was the first deployment of the Carl Vinson with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey aircraft.
In addition to USS Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which left the United States on January 3, is now cruising the Pacific.
For the first time, Lincoln also carried an F-35C squadron, part of the United States Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to these two aircraft carriers, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan, based in Yokosuka, Japan, deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser Lake Champlain and the missile destroyer Stockdale.
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform released the latest satellite image, showing that three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(微博@南海战略态势感知) 三艘美航母集结周边中国 最强大武器罕见访问关岛 On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the U.S. naval transport aircraft CMV-22B.
Also, as reported by the US Cable News Network (CNN) on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US naval arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, arrived at the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday, January 15.
According to analysts, this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This was the first visit by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea islands.
The image shows China's Yongxiu Island in the Nanhai Islands.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam enhanced cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, and demonstrated the United States' capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as boomer submarines.
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunderbolts" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunderbolt the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity," which also includes U.S.-based shaft-launched ballistic missiles and bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads, such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to a friend about Meta's recent 26% drop and $251 billion in market capitalization, Zuckerberg says he's "facing unprecedented competition." Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company that earns most of its revenue from ads, and the advertising companies that make money today have traffic channels of their own.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on, regardless of functional targeting, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance," with many apps externalizing Meta ads and monetizing through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because of Apple’s changes to its privacy policy, Meta is no longer able to access user data, which affects the effectiveness of its advertising.
Apple’s current privacy policy is user-friendly, prompting users explicitly to allow an app to access their information, and most people’s normal response would certainly be no.
The revenue impact on Meta will be even greater if Google does something else.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta’s earlier revenue growth (whose weight is uncertain, but certainly exists) has weakened.
It is generally understood that Meta does not operate in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Each year, at least 10% of Meta’s revenue comes from China, mostly from Chinese companies doing overseas business.
Meta employs about a few hundred people in its Hong Kong office and has several major agents on the mainland.
For Chinese companies looking to expand overseas, Meta is an indispensable advertising channel, and most of the money they burn goes to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the first two years Meta made a lot of money from Byte.
Byte's domestic agents are advertising to Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is good.
I haven &apos; t looked into it recently, but it certainly isn &apos; t better than it used to be.
The days of Chinese firms burning money abroad on a massive scale are over.
Third, new flow channels have not been successfully developed.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta’s hands.
The biggest problem is not just declining incomes, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets look not just at earnings, but more importantly at expectations for the future.
Clearly, Meta’s expectations are not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg spoke of a “metaverse.”
Metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but it takes a long time to realize, and the story should not be enough to sustain Meta's market value in the next two or three years.
So the next two years should be a tough time for Meta.
Regardless of Facebook’s current glory, with revenues of $100 billion to $200 billion a year, the company is in fact very much in crisis, with little safe haven compared to other Internet and high-tech companies.
Although his several social networking software now has a high daily life, and also the mainstream social networking software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of Tiktok, Facebook also has little confidence, and subversion is just a blink of an eye.
And make a meta-universe this hopeful and unattainable concept, in a short time there is no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company, and is constantly looking for a new racetrack the fundamental reason, but I think his racetrack choice is wrong, a road without return above are some of my thoughts, for reference.
