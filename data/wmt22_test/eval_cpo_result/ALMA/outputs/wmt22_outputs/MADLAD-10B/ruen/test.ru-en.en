In my opinion, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac's age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of Balzac's age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Adolescents are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Model "Micropackage Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different stiffness sides: medium-hard surface is formed by latexed coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft - a sheet of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter adapts quickly to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model should be highlighted breathable materials.
The latex, perforated for air permeability, is excellently ventilated in a natural way, as is the coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping place is maintained.
The mattress is also covered by an extended warranty period.
The official warranty from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact the service life of the mattress is longer.
Protection against dust and dirt is entrusted to the removable jacquard cover, supplied in the kit.
Purchase a pair of mattress orthopedic pillow - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filling determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

So no support.
I remember with horror those feasts and guests at my parents' house.
Guests on the threshold, and on the stove are still roasting cutlets, mom is curled up on the floor.
Oh, my God, I was sitting at the table exhausted.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you carry food, two days, a day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They're good, and a cake must be with them.
Since then I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I set the table on the minimum.
And delicious I cook them, bake very often just like that.
Germany: The fourth vaccination against coronavirus is inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
In the opinion of the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed force.
Despite Germany’s vigorous vaccination campaign, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient for full protection.
The head of the General Practitioners Association, Ulrich Weigelt, is convinced of this.
About this on Saturday, December 11, reports Die Welt.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer, at the latest in the autumn," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigelt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with flu vaccination".
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omikron".
And the new variant is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the likelihood of re-infection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
This is shown by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
On this basis, BioNTech / Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omikron".
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
A third dose is therefore necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, president of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, advocates shortening the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, Salzberger believes that accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience shows this very convincingly," the expert emphasized.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally created with ice fishing in mind, and not only for fishing for carp.
These vibes have a greater specific weight than similar sized analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration in vertical and horizontal wires.
As a "winter vibe" when fishing in the balance, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, up and down movements with the rod almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, logs and other obstacles for which a snag is possible.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant for winter fishing for catfish and large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when a pointed and aggressive feeding of the bait is required.
Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unrolls and returns to the original vertical.
No less successfully Bet-A-Vib is used for winter fishing pond trout.
To suit her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to irritate a passive pike that does not react even to live catches.
Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy when catching in a cast.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it is well combined with a line and braided cords of even large diameters.
For fishing for pike, pike, grayling or perch, apart from the uniform, the "step" is also relevant, sometimes with a "crunch" on the bottom.
If you are fishing in crowded places, you can change the front tee to a double one, which will reduce the likelihood of snags.
Among the lures of its class Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively shallow and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers sit on the necks of old parents.

7,000 Russian mercenaries reported in Libya
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) "Wagner" in Libya.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, the Chairman of the Supreme Council of State of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
"There are currently more than 7,000 Wagner mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at the Gardabiya airbase (which is also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the interviewee of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located in Libya".
"Wagner" has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, the agency's publication noted.
Russian authorities officially deny that the private military company "Wagner" is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else could the mercenaries be?
According to the agency, "Wagner" allegedly operates in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, bodyguards for leaders, and protection for energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of mineral and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, the "Wagnerians" allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
The group is not listed in the security agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not listed in the personnel forms.
The company is under U.S. sanctions.
We recall that earlier the post-presidents of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against "Wagner".
The decision is expected to be approved by the EU Council on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of State of Libya is de facto the second chamber of the parliament with advisory functions with Islamists dominating it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for the elections of parliamentary deputies and the Head of State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks until the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," the article notes.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, according to Sky News Arabia.
Foreign Policy as Seen by Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% think that failures prevail.
"Successful examples: 'we defended Syria, we restored peace there', 'the decision on Nord Stream 2', 'the whole world was scared by the cool weapons', 'we squeezed the Crimea'.
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," and "isolation from the world," according to the Public Opinion Foundation's survey.
The Dubai Government has completely abandoned paperwork - all government services have also become only digital
The Government of Dubai has announced that it will be completely paperless and digital.
All government services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the emirate news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase in the digitization of all aspects of Dubai life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," said on Saturday the emirate's Crown Prince, Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now internal and external document flow in all public institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: health care, housing, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitization of document flow began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, the authorities calculated that 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in cash equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's car production and exports fell below 2020 level
Turkey’s car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's 11-month figures were worse than last year's result, reports Bloomberg, citing data from the Association of Turkish Car Manufacturers.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were released from factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75,900 cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year.
And if, according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed positive dynamics compared to last year, then according to the results of 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The decline was driven by a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which fell 29% against the dollar in November.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 MSB subjects received a deferral on credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of incentives for small and medium-sized businesses, reports the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform".
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, pursuant to the instruction of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the Order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. 127 "On the Approval of the Procedure for Providing Deferral of Payments on Loans of Small and Medium-Sized Business Subjects" was adopted, - wrote Alikhan Smailov in his reply to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans provided for granting by banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities, deferral of payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to MSB subjects, including IP, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days, at the discretion of the MSB subject.
A different deferral period could have been specified in the borrower &apos; s application.
During the deferral period, claims and litigation work, notification of the need to repay overdue debts, as well as charging of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended," the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for deferral of payments on loans from 603 borrowers-MSB subjects, of which 553 MSB subjects received deferral in the amount of KZT 9.7 billion.
In MFIs, 131 MSB subjects submitted applications for deferral, of which deferral was granted to 95 subjects in the amount of 105.8 million tenge", - concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Purasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily transfer the strain "okmiron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may tolerate it easier than those with a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergey Purasev explained why the coronavirus strain "okmiron" may be dangerous.
The reason lies in the conditions under which the virus emerged.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunocompromised person.
That is, when it mutated, it encountered no resistance from immunity.
As a result, it is more aggressive.
Because there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there are these spike proteins, spikes, may be more than expected, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Purasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may tolerate "okmiron" easier than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when young 30-year-olds die, and old 60-year-olds in the form of sneezing.
The immune response is furious in the young, it is completely inadequate: where it was only possible to threaten with a finger, it hits like a cannon at sparrows, "concluded Sergey Purasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to cure only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, itching in the throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia by the end of the year can start vaccinating the adolescent generation from 12 to 18 years.
Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the genome engineering laboratory at the Institute, noted that this category is very actively suffering from COVID-19.
In adolescents who go to school, the number of contacts is maximum.
This is the most socially active stratum, as well as the children of kindergartens, - said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the genomic engineering laboratory of the MTFI.
Huge thanks to the author for this article.

Immunologists hypothesized why obese people become victims of COVID-19
The authors examined fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
The immune cells located in the adipose tissue, macrophages, were also infected and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
HIV and influenza viruses are known to hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system’s response.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably capable of doing the same.
Biologist told about the causes of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semen Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and told about the ways of its prevention in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
The development of dementia also affects bad habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in abstract thinking.
"There is discussion that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its onset," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities requiring the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics, FGAOU VO RNIMU im.
N.I. Pirogova, Head of the Department of Cognitive Disorders of the Federal Center of Brain and Neurotechnology Anna Bogolepova told about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30,000 illegally removed artifacts from the country
In the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has managed to repatriate some 30,000 artefacts that had been smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on Al-Hayat TV, the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities Shaaban Abdel Gouad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gouad said that all the smuggled artefacts were registered in the archives.
The Department is now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, the cultural treasures are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
The auction house Christie's on July 4 held an auction, at which a bust over 3000 years old was sold for $ 5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the object of art was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and had not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has actively pursued the repatriation of antiquities illegally removed from the country at various times.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in the Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees’ personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not give its employees corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank uses the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a customer that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have switched to remote working, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the information about the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but very difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is already outside of any literary associations, disgusted with imaginationism, he is alone, but known, in demand, sometimes strongly scolded by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him in their arms.
During the year more than 60 poems were written, many of them - real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motives" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Rus".
And the main success - at the end of June 25th, Gosudarstvennaya Izdatel'naya Druzhba concluded a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
No one of the contemporary poets of Sergei Alexandrovich was honored with such an honor, he was the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Yessenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sophia Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange the family life, to maintain sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
Life seemed to be improving, there was something to rejoice, but for him everything was predominantly painted in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Maybe the wind is whistling
Over an empty and deserted field,
Then, like a grove in September,
Alcohol drains the brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had lost a lot of weight, looked bad, and was obviously ill.
More and more frequently repeated groans, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was given to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
Let's say, relating to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Aisedora Duncan, was recovering in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (Yessenin would visit him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But the evidence of the poet's drinking, scandals on this ground, calls to the police are plentiful - scattered in dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 1920s, the poet's dreadful romance with the green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin stayed for a short time with a friend, the imaginationist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, with his very good income, Yesenin never had his own home either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he lived in rented flats, hotels or with acquaintances.
The elders recall:
"He came only to spend the night, and in most cases in an insane, drunk state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the staircase...
As he fell, he scratched his face and wheezed.
Having recovered a little, he began to cough continuously, sprinkling the whole sheet with blood..."
Yes, and Esenin himself after a trip to Europe and the United States (in the United States at that time was prohibited, but Duncan brought with him a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I saw nothing but huts and streets...
I'm at the end of my life and I can't remember people...
Well, and drank, of course...
But I drank because I was bitten by sorrow."

Polish Foreign Ministry: Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
Polish Foreign Ministry: Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon"
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Paweł Jabłoński expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The Deputy Foreign Minister made the relevant statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he "is actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world".
As the website kp.ru wrote, earlier the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It concerned 17 individuals and 11 entities.
Europe has declared its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve."
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not for Senka hat": when the velvet jacket makes a mockery of the man
Velvet jackets dominated the social events of 2021.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die" he appeared in velvet raspberry jacket and traditional "Bond" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket for the Earthshot Prize ceremony, which did not correspond to the royal dress code, and then chose a more classic version for an event in support of the charity Royal Variety.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend tried on himself and Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress has already noticed a growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to data provided to Gazeta.ru by the service's analysts, they were bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and fitted silhouette, the main colors - dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - sets of velvet suits they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets this season are represented in almost all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is considered to be a model of Gucci, which came to one of the premieres of the film "The House of Gucci" brand ambassador Jared Leto.
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of interweaving the threads, a dense fabric with a fluffy outer texture and a smooth inside is obtained.
More budgetary options are made of cotton or polyamide, but also, accordingly, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that in the case of velvet jacket the main thing - not its model or cut, but the appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a solemn event, - explains Vakhoshkin. - It will also be suitable for those cases where the invitation specifies the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should have a proper advanced party with wealth, - believe the authors of the Telegram channel on men's fashion "Beautiful Brammell." - The owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to related social events, where there is always a dress code.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same ornate things: classic trousers with arrows, single-tone shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, buttons.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from "Beautiful Brammell" are sure: it will be inappropriate to appear in a velvet jacket of an ordinary employee at a corporate event, but if it is a question of "a manager from those who manage this event, then "yes", he has such a thing in the theme".
If the employee rank is lower, and his goal is the desire to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to knock out financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
Management will accurately evaluate the phrase "not for Senka hat", - believe the editors of the Telegram channel on men's fashion.
Very mixed feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, it's so exhausted.
And it is not associated with a nice face of a young girl.
To be honest, I do not understand the admiration of others.
But with all my heart I wish you luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, paid.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they grieved?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also not in surplus - gas, oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are now sold.
The demand for fuel is wild.
It's dripping.
Who's in the flight then?
As usual - an ordinary buyer.
Do Indian problems bother the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be regarded as idiots who "missed" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good salary.
I didn't see a single beautiful person in the pictures in the article.
Just mediocrity within the average passenger.
Perhaps, if such characters are confident in their beauty so much that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, then such and will not sit, most likely.
But only because of mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful (-ic)", but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "A slave who is conscious of his slavery and fights against it is a revolutionary.
A slave who is not conscious of his slavery and wanders in a silent, unconscious and silent slave life is just a slave.
A slave whose saliva runs when he self-satisfiedly describes the delights of slave life and delights in a good and good master, is a serf, ham."
Immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the coronavirus strain "omicron"
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron".
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called vaccination in six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
"With the previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases - after four," said the expert, calling for revaccination in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kruzhkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has been given two vaccines and a booster, or he has been sick and vaccinated, or vaccinated and sick, then he has received "hybrid immunity", that is, many antibodies and neutralizing enough," - the expert clarified.
"G7" warned Russia of "large-scale consequences" in case of invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will cost expensive" to Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," the statement said.
Further, the ministers call on Russia to "reduce the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities", which US President Biden spoke about during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers also stated.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in return," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine &apos; s restraint.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement said.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss said Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "a single voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia."
Pfizer vaccine found to be 32 times less effective than the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
To this conclusion came scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China in Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was deemed less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 drug.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety," Professor Malik Peiris said.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and an increase in mortality if no additional measures are taken.
Head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking NATO arms supplies to Kiev
The head of Ukraine’s defense ministry, Alexey Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev’s acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine’s purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin later softened its position regarding rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to pursue the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
These include the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the authorization of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andrei Melnik expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect weapons supplies from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons with the risk of military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite "Russian occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is convinced that Germany will maintain the same "illogic" position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev expected help from Berlin in equipping the naval fleet.
Ukraine expects that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemned the strengthening of Russian armed forces near the country's borders.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," the statement said.
The G7 ministers and the EU High Representative noted that they were "united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine."
British Foreign Minister Elizabeth Truss at a press conference in Liverpool warned of "large consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to give up aggression against Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).

It was a question of negotiations in the "Normandy format".
The North Atlantic Alliance has also advocated a dialogue on Ukraine in the "Normandy format".

Revealed ways of returning money stolen through online stores
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores, and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when bank card data fall into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to store the main funds on a card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be placed in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend setting up a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen during purchases in stores that do not use the 3D Secure protection technology, it is possible to initiate a refund procedure.
"Within the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility is placed on the participant in the chain of settlements who does not use this service," - said the representative of Promsvyazbank.
An expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay Artur Zaremba emphasized that the buyer has the right to file an application to the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be contested and the money refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Ekaterina Mizulina, a member of the Public Chamber and director of the League for a Safer Internet, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 requests were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances may be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
German Chancellor-elect Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
While Scholz has declared his desire to preserve good relations between Germany and Poland for many years to come, the leaders of the two countries have expressed unequivocal expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia could use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has said that it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving the crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains a source of disagreement.
The European Court has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the operation of "Nord Stream 2" in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to stop the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of the consequences if Russia violates the border of Ukraine, a position confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the "G7".

And I know such apartments very well and I can see perfectly how it was redesigned.
May they be well.
It is always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, toilet, window sills, taps.
You wash them once a year at Easter, so you have to wash them off.

"Under the "creation of conditions for creative activity" is meant the creation on the basis of the transferred property in different regions of Russia writers' residences, in which there would be comfortable conditions for creativity," - explained in Mincifra our publication.

Found money in the wall of the church plumber will be paid $ 20,000
A plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This is reported in a press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians will be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was repairing one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packages with money and checks under the insulation.
He gave the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," he was quoted as saying by KPRC-TV.
The find appears to be related to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
At that time, about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cheques, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church suffered no losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of $ 25,000 was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cowley was not eligible for this amount, as the reward had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at the time allocated $ 5,000 for the reward and later received another $ 20,000 from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's integrity.
He's gonna get $20,000.
It was previously reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - these are her characteristics "as a real person".
That is why the attitude towards it is so negative.
And it is not that "she is financially much richer than all the writers", as it is written here.
There are people richer, but not all behave so brazenly, so provocatively, as this madam.

In Brazil, citizens are obliged to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, it was required to require COVID-19 passports from those entering the territory of the state, a decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Also on the list of exceptions are persons arriving from countries where the lack of vaccine is proven.
"The situation is even more serious if we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourism," Barroso said.
Previously, the Brazilian authorities obliged unvaccinated tourists from coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme of full protection against COVID-19 has been revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Person of Science of Russia Anatoly Altstein in conversation with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
During intranasal administration, immunoglobulins A are formed in large quantities. When the vaccine is injected, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus can not penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you introduce both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision on double vaccination," the doctor said.
The chief preventive UrFO, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injectable is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help because in such a case, the protection of the body is supposed to become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Huseynov said that the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is exactly the picture seen in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, um...
I talked to the dog (dead long ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, food, caress, love and games for a runny bitch, then ahead.
But the pessel was trained and generally clever.
I chose my company and went home.
On the video method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I stopped many owners not to run after the dog, although they said that out, 200 thousand run (pomsky), straight took the hand and led in the other direction.
In the end, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog that ran somewhere.
Massive anti-vaccination protests continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and the authorities’ plans to make COVID-19 vaccination compulsory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spanish people, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some were holding posters with the words "This is a false pandemic", "I will not be vaccinated".
A major protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce health passports by the authorities of several regions of the country was taken against the background of an increasing number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against tightening restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with the security forces.
A group of demonstrators began to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia on this issue there is no consensus.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine," probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve that title.
Only with one thing I agree with Zakharova: the Americans brought only death and plunder to any country wherever they appeared.

WHO detected "omicron" in six dozen states
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the new coronavirus strain "omicron" has already been detected in 63 countries.
Several experts already say that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was described in the WHO report.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has been actively spreading only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new coronavirus variant.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the degree of spread of the "delta" strain, the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Earlier, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the United Kingdom.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will displace "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of sick in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "omicron" at the moment in the Kingdom are sick several hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts forecast tens of thousands of deaths from the "omicron" strain, and at the peak more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
What the British health-care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower than that of other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian Sputnik V reacts to "omicron" - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "omicron" strain.
Why do we see the stages of aging?
Better to see in detail the performance of your exercises.
It is unclear in the first exercise how to do: sitting on your heels or standing on your knees, as written, but how then to lean your hands on your thighs?
Or your hands on your waist?
Curious White, you are right, communication on the Internet - it's completely different, communicate easily and casually, and in a personal meeting and nothing to say.
And to see a person in person, perhaps, it is not what you expected, did not touch - hence the attitude.
When he meets his man, then the views will change.
Again, the Soviet era is called "the time of demons".
Then people believed in God much more honestly than today.
And they were brought up practically according to God's laws (love your neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What is today's ideology - money at any price.
Goblins like Globa have little faith (or no faith at all), but even if so, the time of demons came in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad, communal housing with Bolshaya Zelenina maintains communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to keep the warmth of the older generation.
Perhaps this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was not cancelled.
Unfortunately, we see more and more at funerals.

Yeah, for what?
You pushed your brother without calculating your strength?
And you're always so clever that you never hit anyone accidentally and never injured yourself?

$135 billion went to apps - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending on apps grew by 25% worldwide, and the number of downloads by 8%.
The most popular in the world turned out to be various video services.
Users downloaded the video editor CapCut the most, and spent the most on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed a significant increase between January and November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. User spending in apps increased even more significantly: by 25%, to a record $ 135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile application market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began its post-pandemic recovery.
"Will this'return to physical' slow down the growth of the application economy? Not at all," the authors of the report believe.
India has become a leader in the number of downloads of applications, accounting for about 20% of all downloads.
It is followed by the US (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of gadgets on iOS, as before, spent more than users of Android: iOS accounted for 65% of all spending in apps.
Among the applications, the video editor CapCut took the first place in the number of downloads for 2021.
It is followed by two Indian apps: video service MX TakaTak and online shopping app Meesho.
Telegram is also in the top 10 by number of downloads.
In general, judging by the number of downloads, VPN services are popular among users (there are two of them in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to the creation and broadcasting of videos (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, the top 10 includes two other such services - Moj and SnackVideo).
"The most users spent in applications for live broadcasts and online streaming," - the authors of the report.
YouTube leads the way, with TikTok video service, Disney+ and HBO Max video streaming services, and Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma also in the top 5 in terms of user spending.

Around the world, people have adapted to the pandemic by moving to mobile life, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The most successful industries were those that helped people get closer, both virtually and in person," said App Annie's Chief Marketing Officer, Lexie Sidow.
The revenue of the mobile games sector in 2021 reached $90 billion. The leaders in the number of downloads were casual and hypercasual games, in which there is no or almost no story and minimal video design.
The top 3 most popular games in the world included Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the top games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.

Russians were warned about a new scheme of scammers
The attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is written "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, product director of Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communications is deepfakes.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real recordings with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of a person's behavior.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, the attackers can call the victim’s acquaintances via video link or create a video featuring a copy of the person to be sent for blackmail purposes.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, because a skilled attacker can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenario," - said the expert.
Varonis’ leading system engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video-based technologies.
David, I'll add it.
In what I wrote above, I made an emphasis on the fact that all this bought in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow much paint and walk in short skirts, show stockings and tights on the legs.
It's the province, but the store HAD such a product.
In the big cities, Muslim women also used make-up and showed their thighs.
So in Dushanbe, it is a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there are no cosmetics.
Listed five actions that will help avoid diabetes
Blood sugar problems are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to it, and for no good reason.
Diabetes can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regimen - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water positively affect metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the way to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Specialists advise to adhere to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to a feeling of fullness, secretion of digestive juices and improved absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova talked about "holiday migraine" in workaholics
Several factors can lead to a deterioration of well-being on the weekend
The cause of deterioration of well-being after working days is often "migraine on the weekend", said a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research fellow of the Faculty of Basic Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine Zuhra Pavlova in her Telegram channel.
According to her, especially often suffer from workaholics, who have a headache, breakdown and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are many objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changing conditions.
On weekends, our lives change radically.
"We sleep long, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less," the doctor argued. "Because of the lack of coffee, a small breakdown begins.
From overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness."
Late rising plays an additional role.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jet lag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes most strongly on weekends.

South African scientists claim low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "Omicron"
South Africa claims low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "Omicron"
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "Omicron") corresponds to (the level of) the vaccine's effectiveness of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, due to which... the vaccine's ability to protect against infection is called into question, - says the text of the study, published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, specialists specified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron coronavirus strain could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar in familiar products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product may be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie, composition and glycemic index.
On the label can be presented several dozen names, essentially denoting sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently used names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other skimmed sugars such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black syrup), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which refer to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
As stated in Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and to the many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar taste differently, but no matter what the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
To calculate the exact amount of sugar is not easy, because it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues the transition to the decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the Chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany remains committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, because at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin’s support for Ukraine’s energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok said that the process of certification of the "Nord Stream - 2" gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, during the coalition talks and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline "does not meet the requirements" of the EU.

Twitter account of Prime Minister of India hacked
Hackers have hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It has been reported that India has allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal tender, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi’s office has been asked to ignore new reports.
Representatives of the Prime Minister said that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
The page of the Prime Minister of India has already been hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund with the help of cryptocurrency.
Referendum in New Caledonia: majority votes against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, had yielded the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced at noon on Sunday, 12 December, the majority of New Caledonians voted against independence for their Territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third ballot was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to the preliminary results published by the local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted in favour of independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
Voter turnout was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians taking part in the vote.
Commenting on the preliminary results, Agence France-Presse said that "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as pro-independence supporters urged voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and "fair" election campaign.
This non-participation thus paved the way for a third victory for the supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As announced on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is due to address the outcome of the referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia’s independence has been much discussed in the last weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have spoken out in favour of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour has repeatedly said.
A similar statement was made by Republican candidate Valérie Pécresse, who published a column in Le Figaro in late October urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it is not his responsibility.”
Nevertheless, the President added, "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France".
Sveta, oh, hello!
I told you a little... a lot, it's still embarrassing, embarrassing.
Thank you for not turning away from my channel.

WSJ readers criticize article on US-Russia relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of Russian-US relations.
The author of the article expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow, and made a number of insulting remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "stand with a united front against Russia."
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quotes a comment from a reader.
"Europe is not ours to 'lose', and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine," another noted.

Earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing jet drones of the new generation
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was announced on December 11 by the non-staff adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president’s office Alexey Arestovych.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will be fitted with Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: fuselage and the like," Dialog.ua quotes him.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arestovych said that they are jet-powered, not piston-powered UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the factory at the end of next year, concluded Arestovych.
The ANKA aircraft was developed by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the military operations of the combined forces in the Donbas.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced that the construction of a factory for the manufacture of modern military drones has begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the Bayraktar Savunma company and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, where personnel will be trained, as well as tests and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called the memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
In Singapore Changi Airport escaped lions.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were going.
One of the escaped lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from it because of the protective net installed next to it.
The confrontation ended with the arrival at the airport of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all Singapore zoos.
They immobilized the lions with darts with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Specialists warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies show that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid have a lower risk of developing certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose on the contrary promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises keeping track of the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if you deviate significantly from this figure in the higher or lower direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without the advice of a doctor, be sure to follow the dosage and avoid cereals with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, contained in avocados, Fine recommended that men after 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK by April due to the omicron strain may die about 75 thousand people
Forecasts by British scientists show that up to 75,000 people may die in England in the next five months due to the spread of the omicron coronavirus strain, unless restrictive measures are tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reported.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergencies at the British cabinet, by April 2022, the country will record at least 25,000 fatalities due to the omicron strain, and about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to avoid overloading the National Health Service if the omicron strain turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant and existing vaccines are unable to exclude infection," said mathematician Rosanne Barnard of LSHTM.
Earlier, the Health Safety Agency of the United Kingdom informed: if the speed of spread of the omicron strain remains at the current level, then by the end of the year, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, 1898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the United Kingdom, of which 633 were detected in the last 24 hours.
However, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure may already reach 10,000 cases.

Worldwide demand for superyachts grows by a quarter
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the effects of climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and the money for a floating fortress of 50 million pounds and above, will not decrease, writes the Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that such agitation on the market has not been in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of contamination on land and prefer to escape the pandemic aboard their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are held on zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behaviour of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that, in times of hardship, traveling into space, living on yachts, or flying their own planes irritates the public, because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to take action and suggest new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, even though they realize that, given the mobility of money, this will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, impressive is not only the number of ordered super yachts, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-meter REV Ocean yacht.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool", as well as a submarine designed to explore the depths of the sea.
Helicopter decks, open-air cinemas, and even martial arts platforms have become commonplace on existing superyachts, such as the one owned by UFC fighter Conor McGregor.Richard Wilk, a professor of economic anthropology at the American University in Indiana, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it is symbolic, given that there are just over 2,000 multibillionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is a thousand times larger than that of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the largest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission footprint fell on his 162.5-meter yacht Eclipse.
Even when the owner is not on board, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give a command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not attract sympathy when they, like Australia’s richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain on YouTube that there is no mooring space for their giant ships.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels longer than 50 metres.
Identified dangerous weekly dose of alcohol, leading to the development of colon cancer
American scientists have determined what amount of alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of cancer.
About it writes the Daily Express.
Specialists have concluded that the consumption of four or more portions of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, men who drink moderately have a higher risk of developing colon cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they do not guess how four-legged pets are really developed.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligence is developed in animals.
Although the vocabulary of a dog is not as extensive as that of a human, a new study proves that a dog can respond to 89 words or phrases consistently.
The work of scientists was published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs can not play chess or compose poetry, understand nothing in politics, economics and art, but they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, according to experts, show better results in understanding the words of human language, but statistical data for accurate conclusions are not yet sufficient.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine prepared for the trade of the United States and Russia
The US and Russia will "bargain" about Ukraine's entry into NATO, said analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the publishing house "Glavred".
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations on the United States guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere".
If you are offered something knowingly unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the offerer.
And in the case of Ukraine, a bargain is emerging," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"The preparations are carried out covertly, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, not waiting for the group to be detected and deployed counter-forces," he said.
China boosts development of rail transport industry
Chinese advanced technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition, held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province / Central China.
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said company representative Hou Zhaowen.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was commissioned earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and serviceability of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased exports of rail vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed".
In May this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd rolled out the first Chinese-developed double-decker high-speed electric trains for export to Europe.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the test operation of the metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will travel along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's rail equipment industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the Trade and Investment Department of China's International Trade Promotion Committee.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's high-end equipment production in the world market," said Feng Yaoxiang.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced rail transport equipment production system, with a full range of support facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxiang, the country ranks first in the level of electrification of railways and in operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist listed early signs of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semen Golosheykin in an interview with Sputnik radio listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia may be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive disorders, such as inability to concentrate, planning, lowering the level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion about the fact that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its onset, said the specialist.
Golosheykin emphasized that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways of treating dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking
"There are recommendations for the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community," said Golosheykin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking," said Golosheykin.
Earlier, a charity for dementia research in the United Kingdom said that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 and older.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered problems with vision, because of which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia specialists called aphasia - a state when a person can not find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist Demands to Send Saakashvili Abroad for Treatment
Former President of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili needs psychoneurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the medical council set up by the Georgian Ombudsman, told journalists.
His [Saakashvili’s] neurological status is leading in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, changeability of character," - said the specialist, noting that it does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the former president should be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia," said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
In the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage medical care after he was disciplined by prison staff.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to revoke the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Then we wonder about the extension of retirement age.
These amounts could have been spent on treating people who are really sick.

Protests against COVID passports in Spain
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate were held in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, reports Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports have become mandatory for bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
Many demonstrators came to the event without masks.
The slogans on their posters accused the State of totalitarianism and called for respect for citizens &apos; choices.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city declared a medical dictatorship and called the vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected, more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people.
The bills on the unified system of QR-codes were submitted to the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, public catering and retail facilities with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or transferred disease, or medical discharge from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for train and air travel.

Steep Climb: How Chinese Are Becoming Alpine Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create in the country resorts of international level
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, raising President Xi Jinping’s target of 1 trillion yuan, but also promote the economic development of backward remote provinces.
Taiwu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greening works are also carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task in the long term - to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is far from being the case.
Games Advisor Justin Downes says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year, more and more Chinese go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many years to create a skiing culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation has yet to be created.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, not far from the venues of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chungli, and now no one of the locals suffers without work.
The country is opening more and more shops selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes open restaurants with national cuisine.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station on Taivu.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, with athletes leading major international competitions and resorts and equipment reaching world-class standards.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO said
More than 500 million people in the world could be plunged into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed humankind’s progress on universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
To mark the International Day for Universal Health Coverage on 12 December, WHO and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic has disrupted health services and put excessive strain on health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic has caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, leaving more than four billion people virtually without social support.

Reuters: Taiwan Minister Disconnected from Democracy Summit Broadcast at White House Request
Taiwan's Digital Technology Minister Audrey Tan's panel discussion at the US-sponsored Democracy Summit was switched to no-video mode, according to a YouTube video of the summit.
Reuters Agency, citing sources, claims that the picture was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was marked with a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map that Ms. Tan had shown had been drawn up by CIVICUS, a South African non-governmental organization, and ranked the countries of the world according to the degree to which they guaranteed civil rights.
Taiwan was marked in green as "free," while the PRC, the DPRK, Laos, and Vietnam were marked in red as "closed."
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the views of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the US government."
The PRC was not invited to the Democracy Summit.
Reuters sources noted that the map displayed by the Taiwanese minister could have run counter to Washington's "one China" policy.
An agency source said that after the map was shown, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of portraying Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Democracy Summit" took place from December 9 to 10, with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During "day zero" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Council of Security Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

Personally, my contribution to ecology - refusal to purchase unnecessary and long use of things.
If I go out of the framework - do not throw away, but give to charity.

Do not put them all in one heap - there are bad people, you may have claims to them on a specific occasion...
but what about the number of children, age, pension fund and the like?
Write that they are "bastards, did not return the money."
But how many and when they have children, it is not your business until they gather these children to hang on your neck.
And if this is impossible, then what right do you have to condemn them?
Probably, it's only in education so...
The (self-elected) parents dictate their rules, openly disregarding the already existing ones.
What if it will apply to other spheres of life, judicial proceedings, etc.?
The laws are not written for them.
And if dad does introduce his method of upbringing and education?
It's scary and a very bad example for others.

The Foreign Ministry told about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long road of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
One-sided negative predictability is there, but in part of some perspective of improving relations everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion to the long road we have traveled with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is related to the desire of the US to impose approaches on Russia on many issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not venture to give optimistic forecasts about the prospects of improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, there had been no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to resume dialogue with the US.
Virologist warned about the dangers of vaccination with a nasal drug against COVID outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with a nasal COVID-19 vaccine may develop allergies and need medical assistance, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping malls.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to set up nasal vaccination stations at airports and shopping malls, but I would initially only do so in health-care facilities.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is there, it is small, but it is desirable that the person after that sat next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that act literally in a minute or two, which sometimes is very necessary," said Netesov.
In the opinion of the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in the use of the drug will be gained.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the inoculated person with a stuffy nose sneezes after injection.

Serbia has produced about 2 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, Minister of Innovation and Technological Development Nenad Popovic told TASS.

1239 cases of the omicron coronavirus strain were recorded in the United Kingdom in 24 hours - RT in English
During the day, 1239 cases of infection with the new omicron coronavirus strain were detected in the United Kingdom.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people contracted the new variety of infection in Scotland and five - in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast calculated that in England by April due to the outbreak of coronavirus caused by the "omicron" strain, 75 thousand people may die.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Russian President's Spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose restrictions on Russia without suffering," the Kremlin spokesman said on Russia 1.
Peskov claims that "everybody in the world understands" this.
It was previously reported that the US considers the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sphere as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in respect of Russian banks and the Russian Fund for Direct Investments.
The head of Sberbank, Herman Gref, is convinced that this is impossible.

New Caledonians reject independence from France
According to the final results of New Caledonia &apos; s third referendum on independence, the overwhelming majority of voters rejected secession from France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5 per cent voted against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of ballots were invalidated.
Voter turnout on that day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago went to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris has refused to postpone the referendum date.
In October 2020, the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, the region already held a referendum on independence.
The majority of the inhabitants supported the location of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France claimed possession of New Caledonia.
About 270,000 people live on the archipelago, the territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration allows the region to organise a vote on independence twice, with two years &apos; interval.

WHO preliminarily considers "Omicron" less dangerous than "Delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily believes that "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
However, there is evidence that vaccines are less effective against the new COVID-19 variant.
According to information on December 9, "omicron" is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and the significantly altered antigen profile of the protein of the "omicron" strain suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("severity of the disease" - ed.) May be less severe than with "delta", - says the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of "omicron" infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than "delta".
In Russia, two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center said.
The head of the Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there is no reliable data on whether the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine named four scenarios for Zelensky
Former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and may also compromise on the Donbas.
Denisenko told about this on Sunday, December 12, in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first scenario, which Denisenko called a "perfect storm," implies that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a reduction in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and confrontation of the authorities with the key FPG (financial-industrial groups. - Ed.) ", - added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine may compromise on Donbass, which may lead to confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky’s position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third scenario is a confrontation between Zelensky's opponents and the president, which is likely to lead to the seizure of power and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
In such a crisis scenario, Zelensky will begin "reshaping power", Denisenko added.
Another scenario is Zelensky's transformation into a "father of the nation".
This could be caused by an event that would be a major shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the former deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any likelihood of an "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the US that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from a survey conducted by the Rating sociological group showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as Head of State.
Analysts forecast a situation in which only 21.8% of Ukrainians would vote for Zelensky in the upcoming presidential elections, while 14.5% would vote for former President Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of all respondents expressed support for the president.

I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the garden and not earlier than the beginning of August.

Poet arrested for Red Square protest: "10 days for quoting Yevtushenko, that's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for 10 days.
A student of the Moscow State University of Economics was detained in Red Square with a poster with the hashtag #poetvrossiibolshechempoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was charged under the administrative article for repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public event.
He was detained for the first time on 23 January in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, lost, to the decline of general culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," - explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to explain the message of his message in more detail.
How were you treated by the police officers when you were arrested, this time and before?
What did the department ask, how did they comment on your action?
This time the officers were more correct, the maximum detention, polite, as funny as it might sound in some context of this word.

Researchers told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
Research has shown that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root fruit contains vitamins B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the functioning of the body systems.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high fiber content, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular consumption can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable is better to stew or boil, rather than fry in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, like other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are foods containing carbohydrates that are quickly broken down into sugars, such as sugar, sweetened soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper Kommersant warned about a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private households and an increase in processing capacities.
In the opinion of market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only be replaced by imports.

But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - managed to survive thanks to regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "The Squid Game" and "Tenderness" by Anna Melikian - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engines, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but, judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Universe. 10 years later" of TNT TV (part of "Gazprom-media") is available.

"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more correct to say that Poland only reworked the idea of 1776, but developed it quite effectively.
Actually, the slogan "Ukraine is not Russia" appeared in 1848.

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Current Camera reported on Sunday.
The aim of the missions to be launched in five years' time is to assess the habitability of Venus' clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed instruments for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
So far it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the nearest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist, but it is likely that Venus was originally a terrestrial planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is expected to arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question is whether it is similar to life on Earth or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life was born on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the project "Venus Life Finder" Mihkel Pajusalu.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of metaverses became popular this fall, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend to create remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, because people are tired of disconnection and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money go into digital format.
Anja, you are right, changing diet is a conscious process.

British economist failed to give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O’Neill could not make a forecast for 2022, because, in his view, such attempts would fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in second place - inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in commodity prices was temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of infinite generosity of central banks has already outlived itself" and it is time to return to relations where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with the expected rate of GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, the issue of productivity growth should be addressed, as well as the rise in poverty and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of the Global Research Department of Otkritie Investitsii, reported that positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin named the monetary policy of the Fed, the dynamics of oil prices and fears over the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is pleasing: if we compare ourselves with ourselves, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There is progress, but it is weak.
Another problem is that there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people do not know about them.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) agency show.
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at the meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenue, the Korean brand Kia leads the Russian market.
In 10 months of this year, it managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
Kia's sister brand Hyundai's growth is even more significant - more than 35%, and revenue from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
On the leading positions this brand and the increase in the weighted average price of the car - for a year at Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - stronger dynamics of price increase was only at Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands have not grown so significantly: according to statistics of the committee of car manufacturers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closes the top three in terms of sales volume in monetary terms Japanese Toyota - cars of this brand Russians spent for 10 months 275.5 billion rubles, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand increased both the volume of sales (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (almost by 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz simultaneously has a good growth in sales and weighted average price - higher, for example, than BMW - hence the greater growth in financial capacity, - explained TAAPI Director General Tatyana Arabadji. -
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are performing fantastically, and they have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
Russian Lada in terms of revenue growth dynamics shows average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity are companies whose car sales in units in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and even in the minus - for 10 months Russians spent on SUVs and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and disruptions in production, which encompassed the entire world automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Regularly rewrite price lists for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volumes of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation contributes to this, as well as the desire of automotive companies to recoup past losses, experts believe.
In the conditions of a shortage of cars, I think that many car companies were even able to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of past periods that they could not include in the price of cars earlier,
says VTB Capital's automotive industry analyst Vladimir Bespalov.
I think that financially, car manufacturers are feeling very well now, maintaining high sales margins."
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which are observed during 2021, prices for new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert explains.
In the long term, the market will grow in both quantitative and monetary terms, but mainly at the expense of inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov forecasts.
As supply increases, the scope for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian automotive market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the increase in the cost of cars will slow down, car manufacturers will be able to get their income from volumes, says independent consultant for automotive industry Sergey Burgazeliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers now strive to get the most profit from each car sold, Burgazaliev noted.
Increase in the volumes of car production is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia agitation is heated by uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the market situation, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold more expensive than the original cost, says the expert.
Biden spoke about the deployment of US troops to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending US troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian “invasion.”
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
"There were never such plans," said the White House chief, answering a journalist's question as to whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he emphasized that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the US will deploy forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Estonia).
"We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the eastern flank, the B9 - all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to protect against any attack from Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, Russian President’s Spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the military use by Kiev of drones supplied by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."

If a fraudster calls from such a number, such as an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another security structure, it is inefficient to immediately discard it, and to enter it in the black list, most likely, you will not have time.
Because to confirm his lie about his involvement in the security structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and persuade.

As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey show, in my opinion, you are, to say the least, off topic.
Just yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of the joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KAMAZ.
