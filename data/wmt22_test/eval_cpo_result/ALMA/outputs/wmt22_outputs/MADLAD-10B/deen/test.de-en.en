The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods.
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer and therefore it is not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should enclose the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Sometimes looking, sometimes helping, sometimes bringing the bottle etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be children enough, I don’t see a problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for the short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
It’s up to you to decide if this is right for your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while falling asleep.
Purely legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is where the psychologist’s statement comes from.
Because if something really should happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course your discretion;)
Please help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot but the title doesn't come to mind anymore maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by pouring himself with food and going to his predatory cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, comes to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the place of suicide and to document and put the photos on the internet.
Anyway, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another drives herself to death with intent)
This facing the fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is so the rough plot I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author / author.
If this story is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book I would be very happy.
Oh yeah, I have the password for the Wi-Fi not available.
Must contact my husband first.
However, this may take some time.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 y., splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years, has wood chips under the thumbnail (outer side) over the entire length.
Have tried to pull it with tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
Did not work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to advance booster vaccination
New Omicron cases continue to worry politicians and scientists in the UK.
By New Year, all eligible adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress with corona refresher vaccinations in view of rapidly rising Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
Previously, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support so that vaccination campaigns can also be accelerated in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
There is an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why vaccination protection must be urgently strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Get boostered now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 additional Omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I'm for everyone to introduce themselves with pronouns
I sent an application.
Today came the invitation to a conversation by mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background from it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone help me please?
** I am a foreigner and don’t want to trample on the feet of an official.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today does not work
Obviously, the chair had a non-obvious defect when sold.
How else can such an upholstery damage occur after nine months?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working for approx.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and invoice me.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I am going to write something somewhat detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from my soul.
I (21) frequently come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One issue that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims do not let themselves be helped or think we could not help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my job that move me more than when I can’t do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I do not know what the reason is, maybe it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone deserves to be able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier.
Please, always remember, you are worthy to live without violence, that is so incredibly important.

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby defeat of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick said, looking back on the Cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomach".
After the game, however, it did not settle - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Even more disappointing than the naked result was the manner of the performance.
A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma is representative: The three-pointer rate was just 13 percent, 4 goals (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer came from John Patrick: "After the win at Tenerife, we just weren't focused enough and didn't put into practice what we trained for."
Namely to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "It's great to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe-Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team’s game.
"He's the best playmaker I've ever coached," said Gleim.
While in Patrick's team even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
It was only in the last quarter (22:15) that the Giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already been down 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time left to quarrel.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm) the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg maximum 750 spectators.
we used to have another e-mail address, but I changed it.

Always fresh from the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to delight his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is on the road with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "upon official instruction" to contain the coronavirus.
Also other of his planned appearances in the Advent season have to be cancelled, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to catch up on their dates that were already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe already liked to sing a lot as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin and founded the Palast Orchester with fellow students in 1986.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He has made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blonde hair combed back strictly and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is indispensable in the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been touring since 2020 with the show "Guten Tag, liebes Glück". dpa

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing
The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing groups, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants certainty that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
By the way, a colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against the formation of monopolies.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent ceiling.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician emphasized.

Tornadoes kill at least 100 in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have traversed the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be to be lamented.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
During the night of Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the United States and possibly claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms are leaving a 200-mile (320-km) trail of devastation, mostly in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado raged through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, the official figures rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she showcase #NAME# is sold out.
That is a shame.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely taken out of the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
until when do you want to get in touch?
If the delivery cannot be made to my home, I will have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or submitted a return and wanted to ask if it arrived or is being processed, because I have not received any confirmation yet.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees cash bonuses for vaccination.
Thus, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans to vaccination calls - following the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to receive corona vaccinations.
He has moved to a company about which he has blasphemed.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
Obviously, he has not stuck to his old job and has looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn’t like you back then: well, it doesn’t matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to the greeting!
I am currently leading the adventure Over the Griffon Pass for a group of 4 friends and I want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out and now I am about to write the entry adventure and stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a cart of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the rest of the story is supposed to unfold.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins are to ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: persuading, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever the players can think of.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If not noticed, the goblins lie in wait for the hero in a hollow path and flank the carriage to three left and right of me armed with bows, while two with spears stop the carriage.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
The heroes are all unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The group of goblins will later play a decisive role, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many replies, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I’m sure I’ll take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narrative.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I would like to send them back anyway
If you can send me the receipts, I can pack the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm annoyed with Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to take a little air with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the start accident meant that the schedule was far behind the plan, they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!)
Apparently, however, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and must therefore restrict everything else, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was in F1 once again ignorance of the rules with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both of them only decided that Verstappen could change the tyres when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on the subject.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
In my opinion, you should know these basic rules if you comment on F1 on a pay TV channel.
It is also not the first guessing, what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
Generally does not like the artificial comment style of Roos, but admit that it is a matter of taste.
But I seriously like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant stupidities that make both of them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest in the comment, which he obviously does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-off round Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to F1TV as only the German soundtrack has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising than Sky in the training sessions, and that as a free TV channel.
Although I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the program of Sky Sport F1 is also very meager and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL is doing a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
So in any case makes the great F1 season much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable channel.
I would be interested in your opinion.
You're reviewing: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicoloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and is still not being delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front of the chair).
I ask for support.
Ventilation pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lift.
We offer this series in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect several diffusers.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model fan pumps are also suitable to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find in our shop) or with a decor, which converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or similar to be named.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction, ensuring low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to a spout or similar... and you can start.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and be installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent, if once water would run backwards, that the water from the pool runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we indicate here in ebay the processing time with 3 days, so it is packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take a little precaution so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry... of course Corona does not stop here.
Please do not immediately rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, we like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment,...they have a damn hard time
This is also very different regionally.
Do not be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrest?
Is it possible to order the legs in light?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and host to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under bright blue skies, Bezos personally welcomed the newly elected astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, said as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Among the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on their way for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honour of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their tickets.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission.
During his missions, he had to work hard and do everything himself.
She just flew along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would prefer to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, temporarily with zero gravity, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aeronautical Federation and many other experts consider 100 kilometres above the Earth to be the limit to outer space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin’s third all-manned trip: the first in July was Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, was attended by 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy chief Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of driving the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of mankind and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject actually quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before studying, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to study until the doctorate and will.
At the moment, however, doubts come to me, especially depressing me the career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear again and again great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear again and again of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really be interested:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What did you study / what training did you do?
4) Would you do it again?
Thank you very much for your answers!
I am really unsure at the moment and am thinking about possibly dropping out of my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, please write them as well :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why only now a post to it.
Not only before major holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress at our company.
As it seems there's the also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
Last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails that absolutely had to go out before the driveway, order here, order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that should not be?
Or because people seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also very nervous.
What is this self-flagellation about holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we are not allowed to treat ourselves properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simple: Are only we, the Swiss, like that?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the festival by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love it," Catterfeld said.
But she still has a lot to do before the festive days: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I have to get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of molting and feather formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in poultry farming is solely due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during molting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON-Bio no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered over the drinking water or over the soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Still not working
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG / DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME issue 11/1968, used with play tracks and missing parts see photos, Function good, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have restored
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could carry 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were delivered to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau determined that all six locomotives were suitable for remanufacturing.
[4] As the re-electrification of the central German network progressed, there was a growing need for locomotives for heavy freight service. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were preferably constructed.
Only when it was foreseeable that the refurbishment number could not be increased further with the E 94, the E 95 moved into the focus of refurbishment.
[4]The locomotives were initially stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway operating station.
They arrived at Hall P in 1960.
They were used in a separate circulation schedule mostly before coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
So it often happened that switches stuck during switching operations.
Then the Beimann, who was constantly traveling on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the bolt again during the journey.
Damage to the drive motors occurred frequently and led to months of failure of the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough newly built locomotives and a significant expansion of the electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the splitter types, so that the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one man, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility conditions from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were decommissioned in mid-1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which was decommissioned on 5 October 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was placed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at the Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external restoration of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then it belonged to the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986 the interior of the locomotive was completed.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is cared for as a museum.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and outer painting, whereby the transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the central German network.
Main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handmade model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical reworks on the locomotive in own work necessary, dusty, with play traces, cellar smell!!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage traces.
Yes the F-parts are it
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The central beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam can not be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't set up the bed.
The central beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately faulty produced.
The central beam does not fit into the provided bracket.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
no no flat.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones of the shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they fulfill their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I have them sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
Residential fire with two slightly injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range was caused, the police said on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (district Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume a deliberate arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping again
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin posted on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously commented publicly on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was false information on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this, because communication should not revolve around him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a serious Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, often fueled by misinformation and suspicion."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, so sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not allowed by law to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization in the vaccination of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been suspended for a long time - and the Biontech chief has been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Tens of thousands without power after fire in substation
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with serious damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to live without electricity for about 24 hours.
As a result of the fire, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities on Friday evening.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale fault could finally be completely removed late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood help.
The supplier thanked the people affected for their patience and the helpers for their dedication.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians were initially only able to put some lines back into operation temporarily, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at around 7.15 p.m. on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Comprehensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 6 pm, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., those last affected by the outage have also had electricity.
More than 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood aid after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings at noon on Saturday.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and notify the local fire department if help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not provide for themselves or who need power-dependent medical devices or are dependent on medical care.
Good afternoon!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euros?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
But I can not mount the base on the table top.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can not push them into each other and thus shorten.
Can you help me?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, as it is otherwise not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy about a feedback
yes that is really easier!
Then let's do it this way!
will you send me the return note by mail?
the repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
Such a low credit I find almost outrageous.
We do not agree
Nordic combination: Riiber wins
The German Nordic Combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Once again, the duo had to surrender to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country with a large lead after the ski jumping.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made s new and use the version 4.5...
it could be that they've heard of the problem before
Have directly with my #PRS_ORG #, bought a book it also seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be incorrect, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work in between!
In order for the paint application to be even and clean, you should clean the components of dust, grease and fingerprints with a little soapy water, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Slight overlap of the paint layers ensures an even surface later.
Avoid swiping the brush back and forth.
This results in unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metallic shades and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal streaks when they mix with normal colors.
Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve an original look through the decals or decals.
From national emblems on airplanes to ship names to decorative strips and license plates on car models: The decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still within easy reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or easier before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them.
Decals are also called water slide pictures, because you briefly moisten their back with water until the backing paper becomes dark due to the wetness.
Then slide the image only a small piece from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away from the side.
Attention: Always check whether the image is correctly positioned before you completely slide it off the paper, so that it does not stick to the finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Suck off excess water with a kitchen towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and reload the book and find the place where I read.
On Saturday I have already communicated with you.
Will I receive it by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 individual packages with me
ok anyway thank you!
then I will buy elsewhere once the money is back.
But can I get it back without problems?
Fertility treatment with PKV / What is an "insured event"?
Hello to all,
we were some time in fertility treatment, now when it comes to the settlement with the PKV, this is suddenly cross.
In turn:
We had applied for the Kinderwunschbahndlung in advance at the PKV and got the approval over 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the private health insurance.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle them with the PKV.
We again applied for the cost coverage at the PKV and were again granted 3 further attempts.
After some more trials (we performed more trials than promised, logically the most expensive are charged to the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 trials (2 + 3) the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 trials.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first approval expire.
The wish to have a second child is a new insurance case.
According to the Terms and Conditions, however, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or we (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts expire?
* Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Thank you in advance for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
All right.
We will not order anything from them again.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customers.
They are welcome to pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the refund was initiated and now you tell me that I must first send the thing back.
I can probably do nothing for the chest of drawers arrives completely upset with me
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It says clearly that the refund has been initiated and I have still not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect did not appear until a few months later.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with stools to be purchased in addition, but unfortunately we can not find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget film is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Would like to inquire the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much
Best regards,
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I soon give up again, because it just does not work here.
Hello.
"Half a victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost to the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can claim a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation in a sustainable way, explained the researcher of the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of uncertainty - Belarus is not giving up very much, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
The way people are treated at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
There is apparently an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not oppose it decisively, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens the cohesion of the Union.
"It obviously cannot assert itself when a member state decides to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said: an agreement in principle on asylum policy is made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
New attempt to cross the border
Meanwhile, according to the Polish border guard, migrants have again tried to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
Fifty-five migrants were detained on Sunday night and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were thrown with stones by the migrants during the incident near the village of Czeremsza.
According to reports, one soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, who is in power in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania blocked sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
Belarusian society is probably not adjusted to the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule violations during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
One protest relates to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in Red Bull in the final safety car phase, when he allegedly overtook in violation of the rules.
A second appeal was filed against the scoring at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I'll check it.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you
thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park organises SC-Freiburg-Fantag
Europa-Park, the namesake of the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As the park announces, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The rollercoaster trains shone red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," says the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
The first SC Freiburg Fan Day at Europa-Park showed once again how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" in the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I left the contact form yesterday to return an item, but did not receive an email confirmation or the like.
My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your stupid chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake you fix and not all from our budget.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a re-order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This e-mail has not arrived so far.
The package wants to go to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry but just because he says he's not an antisemite doesn't mean anything.
This is like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both will not admit their i.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should simply leave it completely.
Yes wow then you are similarly not to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
For my sake, a God has set the whole thing in motion.
But once you are a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is all nonsense.
And thus you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously as Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be placed as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically free of distortion and colour defects right up to the edge.
Magnifiers are often marked with magnification values.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifier optimally, we ask you to observe the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see user manual in the package).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
Reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable if the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Fir sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curious situations when selling fir trees.
Once, a man is said to have gone home without his partner, because the two could not agree.
Each year, he plants a good 2,000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a little funny, he says.
And that with the voucher??
Otherwise I am gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss which court is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both therefore have their name.
In German, an equivalent would perhaps be something like the "Dreher", which sounds far from delicious.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wifi network.
Before I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which except for a few failures has received and transmitted 50 Mbit flawlessly.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, they also arrive.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain to me why with fiber optics so much internet speed is "lost" via the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really despairing, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it’s time to switch current accounts
Those who thought that the current accounts would be quiet for the time being are deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to use all kinds of tricks to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past, the free amounts for negative interest rates are also falling further.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long regarded as relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now it has just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for overnight savings accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have even been granted in the first instance before the Regional Court of Berlin against this regulation.
The banks are already discussing whether they should make provisions - in the event that the higher instances also declare negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.
The table top for 8 people was delivered instead of those for 6 people.
The base is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston Has a Whole Beauty Army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like an uphill and downhill ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made a stir in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of her appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, you read that right: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
That the hearts of female and male fans still fly to her equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she is simply unlucky with her luck - and still looking for the great love.
And stripped the baby wish from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would be a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame also make you happy.
Unworthy end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
At the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Räikkönen had to abandon his Alfa Romeo less than halfway through the race after a driving error and a slight contact with a gang.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the top class of motorsport.
To say goodbye, his wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest achievement was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and finished 103 times on the podium.
Friedrich takes 60th World Cup win - Nolte wins doubles - Sports
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I calculated that, I would have to win nine and a half times per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the two-time Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, on Saturday, he defended the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from third to first place.
Then he made some changes to the material setting and drove out a larger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took more risks today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also claimed his 22nd win in a row.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, riding for Stuttgart, came from second place to fifth this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it the same way," said Lochner.
Nolte wins at home - Podium for Jamanka
In the women’s doubles, Laura Nolte won her third win of the season on her home track.
After only finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced to World Cup victory with pusher Deborah Levi in the German triple on Sunday.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came second with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she scored her first podium place this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden finished in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium in the World Cup, I am superhappy that Mariama takes me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not completely error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had the blanket already in the cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just did not receive it and therefore could not redeem it, so I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that it had expired which annoyed me very much.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order again, because it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And do not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and women,
I have some things that I just want to write and maybe it's the one or the other too...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog does not scream or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (since 6 years together) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him, because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burn).
On top of that, he is chilled and we currently see each other less (1-2x a week), which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My dog has a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have some housework to do, which we naturally divide between ourselves.
But cooking myself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTSD illness is currently quite well adjusted, I am halfway well treated and get along.
Not good, but I get along and am almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy class for which I should prepare at least a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that, the whole thing continues, right?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Loading...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I’m just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I can’t handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't do it...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I’m infinitely grateful that I don’t have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't put that in words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought that I would surely find fellow sufferers here...
I definitely wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately is the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
In the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, twice.
But it was not confirmed.
Now something completely different: I noticed at school that many teachers of religion do not believe in God and for them it is just another subject like mathematics or geography.
For me that was always a bit strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed that way somehow.
How do you feel about it?
Perhaps you can also tell about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you do not believe it?
Culture wahren or something?
Hope you question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?I like to write in English, I also understand it well
That's a very long time, then I would refrain from it
It's good, thank you.
I expect a prompt response, no later than the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie search help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the film there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernity (the real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can not describe it in detail anyway in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, their paths cross and a story is born.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm to be able to live myself, I think.
I think the transition is also the grave of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight against each other.
If you know something I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has only slept on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than you think.
Make sure that everything is right around it, no cuddly toys, frequently go in and look, but no minutes of surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Very good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it stand up straight from its belly?
Or is it lying with the face forward Directly in the mattress?
From this, you can deduce whether everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was e.g. common practice that you put the kids on their stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But then why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
Let's be clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this station is now under all the dirt.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time go on a big begging tour.
It was said that they were an "independent" Internet station.
Quote Arno: You want to "not be a running litfaßsäule".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising station that tries to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they are allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How can you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I ask for a call back, because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Body break due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach aches or just for cuddling - My little warm friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry kernels can absorb heat very well and release it again in doses.
The removable inner cushion is easy to heat in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the use particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry kernel cushion with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following areas of application:
Before heating the cushion, check for atypical odor, stick or burn stains and immediately dispose of if present.
Please take the inner cushion out of the cover before warming!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first heatings, a slight moisture formation may occur on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications.
Keep to the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burning).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is permitted in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max 43 ° C) on your elbow!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as in persons with reduced pain sensitivity.
In case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams open and loose cores leak, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and out of the reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to exclude overheating!
Any serious incident occurring in connection with the device shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after first leg - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 are working their way out of the bottom of the table.
For Ingolstadt, it also does not work under the third coach.
Celebration in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone is enough for operation.
No way, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the plugged-in power supply.
Then I removed the battery, but here too nothing happens.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network mode?
Is something else broken?
Thank you so much for your help!
I would like the #PRS_ORG# to be delivered to my room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But do not know how high the seat is.....
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity swallow even larger photo equipment without problems, which can be stowed securely with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need in everyday objects, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, stays well organized and separated from the photographic equipment.
With the “update” of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still allowing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
There is a metal closure hook in the closure flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different “fill levels”: there are 4 anchor bars, stable riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be closed reliably without the hook clicking in.
The second possibility also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional top-access backpacks - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: If you not only take your photographic equipment, but also everyday objects or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
This also allows you to pull the backpack in front of your body from the right side to access, for example, the camera gear in the right main compartment, while the everyday items stay securely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And because the backpack’s outer shell is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry, even if you’re headed to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the
Contact by the freight forwarder to collect the wrongly delivered table announced.
So far I have not received any message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am now writing with the third support employee, with none of them I got further than the promise that I will receive an email as a confirmation.
It is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#
It is foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping it that way is not an option for me...
It does work.
Thank you very much for the help
Have a nice evening
hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that last year went differently than expected, I could not guess and just could not redeem and clarify it in time.
But the damage I have as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of dynamic drivers who appreciate reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is based on the characteristics of the original assembly with the balancing of the disc.
The thus produced tuned discs ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, and the cut-outs improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic qualities of our tuned windows emphasize the character of each car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered glowing boulders in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many it meant: “Coloma or Bust”!
In this game, you are a pioneer looking for wealth and making a name for yourself in the West.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, raise horses, and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You'll need to outperform your fellow pioneers to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that “works” more and more for you (so-called “engine building”).
The buildings on your board allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can make fine adjustments to develop your own style of play.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California officially became a state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving carts, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the Anpreiser turns to a new location, changing the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which players must defend Coloma from a raid of angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it immediately.
>Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008) he triggered a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and guardians are now raising serious accusations against him.
​Please take care, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
For us parents and other responsible persons, it must never, never, never be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and is possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the abolition of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated people
The health ministers of the Länder want to decide on a nationwide waiver of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated people at their next meeting.
"We states need clarity quickly, whether and from when the test requirement can be waived for triple-vaccinated people," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," Holetschek said.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers as early as next Tuesday."
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to proceed?
Hello, I like the #PRS_ORG# chair very much, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make purchases via my #PRS_ORG#.
Oops, an error has occurred.
Purchase via the #PRS_ORG# site on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What could this be?
What you describe is called *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common is the hearing of sounds / voices, less often to see pictures and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anaesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the nipple is removed.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthesia interview.
Certain anaesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but **u/Nitemarex **had none by definition.
I read your comment incorrectly.
But the chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20 € do not help us.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email that you have not answered.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that the case?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I do not know a person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
am I not called?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle dies at age 97
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental history of the theatre.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I testify here already my life thanks".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used in Europe as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistik Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected
New York wins MLS title for first time
New York City FC has won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After a 1–1 draw in regular time against hosts Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team won the final 4–2 on penalties.
In the Eastern Conference Finals, New York defeated Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Roulade tips & tricks
I got a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
This was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I have come to the taste and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What’s next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I can handle it
IEs about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed on 18.01. by mail that the refund was made.
But until today I have not received the money.
Would you please check there.
Where to find Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven’t bought any poultry yet?
Time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amp sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuitry.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME knobs, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other hand.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to lower the sound level without changing the gain and distortion.
Above we already mentioned that you can use the POWER LEVEL control to create a power reserve when it gets shamelessly loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or with direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favourite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 footswitch, you can also conveniently call up the sounds by foot, switch the effect blocks on / off and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But had seen that with others.
Is there a possibility to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with this?
And the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it is not possible, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are then a bit much.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear deal
According to Iranian sources, progress is emerging in the negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics to be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", because at the beginning there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after almost a week of interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now the state with the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only federal state with a corona incidence above the 1000 mark on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value of 1,025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and can hardly keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it right?
here I don't have to click/enter/fill in anything else?
That’s exactly what I want to avoid, that’s why I’m writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my eyes an impertinence.
It’s time for change
###MBundestag greet me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: It does not exist.
We have entered a winter hibernation and have extended the summer gap to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, this may simply be related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have gone here and how we generally present ourselves.
In recent days, the impression has increased that many here really still want the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked, which wants to keep it alive.
The impulse came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in recent days and found a, simply put, pile of shards.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project also exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair election system?
I’m pretty sure I forgot a few things, but that’s not a problem, we have Discord for that at the end of the day.
If you feel like it and have time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you that is still delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big / bulky for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I assembled it and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the defective cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will disassemble the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me by phone to arrange a pickup date.
Is there a manual for assembly?
How long do I have to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, currently probably eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before.
When I was asked if I had always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
For a long time I thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that discontent arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said that she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian one reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too “plump”?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without you worrying about it.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be on site on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I can not be on site because of a funeral, this can unfortunately not be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pickup date.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be available again.
Lahnstein fire brigade equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the state
Recently, the Minister of the Interior of Rhineland-Palatinate, Roger Lewentz, handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the Volunteer Fire Brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, the number of operations is expected to increase continuously: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the continued increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but have synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter an appointment in the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for facing the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, that is, we were also weapons carriers in the executive, further I do not want to go into it!
I always find the question of right and left to be very simplified.
Basically, however, one should say that of course the state servant comes rather from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That of course also in the special uniform and weapon bearer people right from conservative magically attract should also be clear to everyone, that these people then of course can hardly deal with the lived reality is of course also clear, because you have of course in addition to the average white, meanwhile many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I do not mean the overly feminine cliché gay, because there are rather fewer to none in the executive but quite normal men and women who you do not notice if they do not tell you) and also on these people I can and must rely on me, because in doubt they save your life or use this for you.
But even these marginal groups represent, even if it sounds strange at first, in my experience, a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel rather less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly stands for them or thinks they have to do it right, but they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right there, but that these are openly allowed to say their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that especially policemen and soldiers who were often deployed abroad often begin to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that sometimes right-thinking people meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such a thing is well fought and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so much internationally entangled and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
yes, what I do not understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, was not sold out.
I ordered already in November.
it was confirmed to me but so in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could you still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches, which were filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Tidier by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been concerned with one thing for some time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, very little free time), but for my whole life I have been struggling to keep my household clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything stays lying, and now and then it grabs me and I clean up and clean.
But it’s really never like “someone might come to visit spontaneously”.
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, it disturbs me somewhere but mostly household simply loses against work and unwillingness.
The kitchen is still cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more tidy with a child?
We do not have one yet but are working on it and this question has been occupying me for some time.
Because for me, I have no incentive, it just does not bother me so much, as long as no visitor comes and e.g. always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you remain sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows an almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaped with special, wide embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee squats)
Compared to the Focea Comfort 4, the Flex System 2 has more than doubled the area covered by the Flex System to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee squats)
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back and in the crotch ensure a snug, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper, improving comfort, especially when bending down and mounting and attaching equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone around the shoulders and at the back guarantees increased flexibility during movements of the arms and the back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face to the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate head hood)
Soft, in the collar zone improves the sealing with a fine adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle Velcro closure, which does not stick to the lamination or the seams

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in the field of software development and have been trained for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time to start again and study social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
This roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a business level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told many times that I seem unapproachable (which I think has improved).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family assistance.
But I do not know if the concrete work day is really as I imagine it, and it is difficult to find anything about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("already screwed up the simplest things again") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do it myself" / "I keep him from work with my stupid questions" / "he must really think I am underprivileged" etc.).
I will probably have problems in any profession but I wanted to mention it here.
But have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean, give back, please?
When I download a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The bird breaks down the protein (protein) taken up with the food in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds up its body's own protein substances from these in turn, which it also needs for feather formation.
The plumage formation of the nestling and the new plumage formation of the molting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as otherwise there may be disturbances in the brood process.
Following this treatment with NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply should be resumed with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g of NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water / soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water / food daily.
One coated measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Organic.
In the case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the beginning of feather reformation is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until the feather formation is completely completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse us, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break down after nine months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement of a community employee in opposition to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So fellantrag made to the municipality.
An employee writes me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are unambiguous.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the they new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
yes, I think so, only the question is yes, if I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Serious traffic accident near Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the junction Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the press alert of the police currently reports (14:03 o'clock), a car came into the oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injuries.
Ah okay understand.
Well, then thank you again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is only moderately good, because my dear head is just deconstructing everything that can be deconstructed.
Before I stop here now.. in short: I need advice and best from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the ref as a newcomer.
Originally I studied something else and also worked in an area there (to remain at least a little anonymous, I do not name anything more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up with teaching and I was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I'm now at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
The times before, I always decided to keep going and at least finish the refrain, after that I can always turn around.
But right now I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my end of work my end of work.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn’t matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that irritate me even more.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well, as far as the feedback and so on is concerned.
But I am completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing so.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but was paid appropriately and worked together in a team and not as a solo fighter as is the case most of the time.
But then I wonder if I will not be back in the same place in a year and be dissatisfied.
You notice, it's all kind of confused, but maybe you as outsiders have advice or ideas, how I get out of this situation, that I'm completely finished and almost at the slightest thought of it I start to cry.
I’m not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably won’t lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and apologies for the whiny undertone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has evolved, combining advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuitry, which perfectly replicates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a closed enclosure and a bass reflex system that delivers natural resonance.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual plane until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 led to another performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string touch as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
Equipped with a 12AX7 tube, the Valve Reactor circuitry of each VT+ amp perfectly mirrors the behaviour, subtle nuances and tonal character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The series of defeats of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What fits in the backpack depends of course on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with one lens attached, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can still store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also an optimal choice for drone pilots, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows have caused great damage on the Canary Island.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, but volcanologists still dared not predict when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, told state TV channel RTVE.
Damages worth millions
In just under three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other structures, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Outside the coast, cooled lava formed two new islets with a total size of about 50 hectares.
Banana cultivation, which is extremely important for the island and on which about half of the 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly badly affected and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of natural peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through which the Christmas days were closely linked to giving gifts.
Previously, gifts were given on St. Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night in order to spare them another life in sin.
This unconventional way of giving gave rise to the popular custom in Germany of filling the boots of children with gifts.
Protestants were offended by this custom, because they reject mediators between God and man as "saint worship".
For these reasons, they oppose the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of giving gifts shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so narrowly, only a few are annoyed that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the Martinsbrauch with Martin singing and Martin procession.
Today, you can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of giving gifts since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving gifts shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful cuddle-muddle over the question of who will bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is supposed to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
An armed man was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man who allegedly entered a bank and a bookmaker’s shop with a gun.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped shortly after by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
The area around Kensington Palace is home to several embassies.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting time max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow in color.
On the other hand, »Smart Stone« is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly – either in white or coloured light (in six different colour shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it can assert itself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself extensive preparatory work: as a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require any supply cable or batteries.
Place the "light stone" in any place lit by the sun during the day.
Two supplied ground spikes provide firm support if necessary.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides »Smart Stone« discreetly in its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
When dusk falls, »Smart Stone« begins to light up automatically; you decide in which colour: you can choose from six attractive light colours – in addition to daylight white.
Finally, the switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has fallen to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I have done this several times it does not work.
Too bad, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will not order again in principle.

Pill problem
Hello dear ladies,
I hope I do everything right here, is after a year reddit actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shitty PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave that again, because I have to take enough medications due to chronic diseases, which I can not choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last break of about two years, I had an explosion of pimples from 0 to 100 and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really burdened me and I did not feel comfortable.
In the two years of the break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid that this time.
Perfume-free and without fuss is my cosmetics already, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend me.
Unfortunately, gynecologist has not taken me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is yet to come.
Thank you so much to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had prebupertary bad neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale nodular psoriasis and the acne issue.
Nutrition, I also tried everything possible in the course of chronic illness and stuck on sugar, milk and low-meat mixed food, because nothing else worked really well.
It can also be that hormonally simply the worm is in, but if you like me everywhere has a construction site, you just don't want to look for what else is going wrong.
I had already everything her colleague semina o. ä.
Wrote and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work in between and on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but there is it generally in large

In the name of the people: lay people participate in judgments
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the bench.
But a lot depends on their verdict, even if they do not wear a robe: Sheriffs determine with professional judges whether and how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them report in an interview with the "Oeffentlichen" on their time at the Bad Kreuznach Regional Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Regional Court on John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.

110 kV underground cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The Lower Bavaria government’s planning approval clears the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometers long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Hello and good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.

Thank you for your message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, that's why the request at #PRS_ORG#, as it is probably a general problem
Ref: Lesson planning (EC)
Dear colleagues,
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun for me, but I currently have great problems to plan my lessons in geography time-efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can also only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
It takes me a long time to plan my lessons.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors, and with me, every lesson is unique.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I also need it for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start with the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work time-efficiently with the book.
Would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
The trade is afraid of Christmas business because of the 2G rule.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
Retailers consider this to be unnecessary and complain about falling sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
In the view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retail.
HDE CEO Stefan Genth criticised the decline in sales in shops selling non-daily necessities.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively on the remaining days of the year.
Many have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless hole," Genth said.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales last week.
Only food retail and the online sector are doing well.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO.
"2G when shopping will not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The ribbon regulation must be allowed nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops on that day with the band received.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - random checks should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Frequencies, excluding 2G, were recently at just over 75 percent of the pre-corona level, with revenues at around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business," CEO Wilhelm Wellner told Wirtschaftswoche.
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, attempts are being made to find solutions for the centers and to get them approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "the visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed."
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also a fault, which was tried to be masked with a yellow filler.
This looks unsightly.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I proceed with the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
The adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp is provided by a modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The luminaire produces a very light flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It’s a great tool to work with on the set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the luminaire is the control panel, it consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory keys and you are done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that the known situation is again when switched on - Very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operation with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - there is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have to attach a 16mm sleeve as a connection, so you can directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be adjusted reliably by means of stops on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and tough use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
Great is that a bag is included in the scope of delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may still want to buy without problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small:(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrate after goal-packed comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a row unbeaten Hessen were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SGE turned up, shot the frustration over an average start to the season from their soul within an hour and won furiously with 5: 2. "It's crazy what the guys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and spoke a "global praise to each and every one who was there.".
Initially, it looked like a new setback for the Frankfurters, who are still behind their expectations in ninth place.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen in front 2-0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was back on the pitch for the first time since recovering from a muscle injury on matchday four, also emphasised the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner, however, wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also sees himself in a good position with regard to the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now they want to "go on step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the turn of the year "at this level".
The next game in the English week is against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday (6.30pm, Sky).
I just got the mail that my package is coming back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be shipped directly to me or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Would mean for me then unfortunately that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Women's handball lose to Spain in quarter-finals
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's women's handball team slipped off the court with hung heads and empty eyes.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB team suffered a heavy defeat 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to play hosts Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were far too fearful and had too much respect for the opponent," said coach Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After their first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished in second place in Main Round Group III with 8:2 points behind the Danes (10:0).
It’s a shame that we couldn’t take the flow with us.
It was a bad game from everyone and we have to clear it," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals against the World Cup runners-up of 2019 next Tuesday, a significant increase will be needed to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German scorer in the duel with three-time Olympic champions Denmark was Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack nor in the defence," admitted back Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
From front to back not on the level
Unlike in the previous five tournament matches, the German team was not up to the task at the kick-off.
Misthrows and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on working temperature and prevented worse with a few saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
However, this was not the expected initial ignition.
Against the aggressive defence of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in the scene - and if they did, they mostly failed the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
Thus, the game had started early with the 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially as back Mia Zschocke a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent also saw red.
In the quarterfinals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB team get a little better into the game and came close to at least five goals by the break.
The hope for a catch-up after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-disposed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to improve their performance and left the court as a clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions in the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we caught St. Nicholas Day and take this as an opportunity to devote ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas season, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas holidays.
How was it at your home back then?
How about your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the most beautiful thing for the children?
The boot polishing?
Baking cookies?
Christmas tree decorations?
Is there music?
Is Santa Claus coming, the Christ Child or is the gift from grandma and grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort to have it as nice as possible as a family.
Whether these are fixed traditions, or even something different every year: tell us how it went or goes in your family!

Is that possible with them?
As the title suggests, I work as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated primarily in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be finished to a large extent, it will continue for me in vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit to the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. "I take medication X, is that compatible with the vaccination..").
My area of responsibility includes the explanation for vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination order and no reasons that speak against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical specialists.
In vaccination teams, however, we often have none with us, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, but who cannot (may not?) Perform vaccinations, so that I also perform most of the vaccinations myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent by an Amberger, has been used in the BR TV show "Wir in Bayern" for intense reflection.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained un guessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous".
Nor is he someone "for whom everything has to go fast".
That, the people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
On which the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment in many Upper Palatinates.
"The Huidlerer", the audience learned, "is a rag that someone uses to wipe the stove".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by the Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
Which closed a gap in education - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
The following error message always appears after confirmation: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, restarted, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Selection of tyres for a road bike - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike ride in the coming week.
Said, done and I drove off with my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what happens in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!)
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire did not want to go the rest of the way.
Because of the day of the week I had no real possibility to get a spare jacket and a spare tube, I had to turn around with a rather bad mood and take the first best track home.
It wasn’t so bad in terms of mood, maybe it’s better if I practice changing the tires before the bike ride.
But now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would not like to have this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, has the day I came to pick up the bike until 14 o'clock 120km torn!) and who had already described them as suboptimal, because he has been riding with them for several years on a roller..
But when I think that I have to change my tires after 80-90kms, I think I'm really in a bad mood:D
Now I came into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me surprised why I did not have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be flat-proof.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so unbreakable?
I don't want to spend 40€/tyre now, only to be disappointed.
Furthermore, I wonder: I have at the moment on the road bike I think 25x622.
Those are also available (apparently) with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to use other tires on a road bike?
The Schwalbe site seems to my absolute! Laiewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for your help and best regards!

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
The new offspring is called SOLO 15 and is visually reminiscent of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, a suitable designed stand is included in this construction proposal to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears considerably grown up and for her size extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight rise in the treble.
This is commonly used in broadbands to optimize the strongly increasing bundling at too high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the treble range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamics that seeks its equal.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final look of the loudspeaker at the beginning, in order to plan appropriate changes during the construction.
If you want to veneer the housings, for example, the sinking of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, because the veneer applies material again.
After all the panels have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floor panel at the appropriate place, so that the cable can be passed through without problems later.
With the help of an upper milling machine, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be flush installed.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the bevel, as shown in the picture "Detail bevel".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back panel, the lid, the front and the bottom are glued on.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, so the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole saw or a Forstner drill, it is easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection clamp on the rear wall.
Then you use a circular cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded with it.
Afterwards, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) the screwing points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuum / blow out), begin laying the cable.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear panel.
Push the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the base to the terminal opening and let it stick out about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, you lead the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang out there as well.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and installed.
The drawing of the crossover, as well as the corresponding wiring diagram can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions Crossover Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely sealed, follows.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, the sealing can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the appropriate screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello everyone,
> finally we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> For known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per switch, so we will be watching the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – nevertheless, we will do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Set your drinks cold, plan good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
