Screaming to the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gotten off to a good start and the cries and calls out in nature are starting to attract people all over the world.
“You have the answer, I need Iceland,” says a woman in the big world in comments to an ad from the Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign on YouTube.
Another spectator says he will keep Iceland in his heart forever and a young woman says she has to get to Iceland as soon as possible because her boyfriend lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States and expects to have to wait a few more months.
Another viewer asks if the walk to Iceland is possible, because there are no planes.
It is not known if he came from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson of Peel advertising agency, which produced the ads together with international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the response has exceeded expectations.
“I’ve been involved in many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already beating records.
Basically, this is about creating PR value, that is, getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about 700 media outlets around the world, reaching more than two billion people.
The value of that coverage is priced at ISK 1.8 billion.
It’s not bad.”
The main market is usually the United States, and the campaign has gone very well there, although Americans are not on their way to Iceland in the near future.
According to Egill, well-known markets such as Denmark, the UK and Germany have also recovered well, as has Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
There were also reactions from foreign regions, such as India, which were not expected.
“These ads have travelled farther than we expected,” says Egill, and it should be noted that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better start.”
The photos on this opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, photographer of the newspaper Morgunblaðið, during the shooting of advertisements entitled “Let It Out” in the middle of last month.
The film was shot on locations such as the Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavik, Reynisfjörður, Skógarfoss, Sólheimajökull and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The film was directed by Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson at Skoti productions and shot by Óttar Guðnason.
The film stars Anna Jia from Iceland and Murphy Cardenas from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders participated in the production of the advertisements, but at the same time as recordings were taking place in Southern Iceland, another group was in Western Iceland and the West Fjords.
According to Egill, “Let It Out” is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but a winter campaign is planned in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for Íslandsstofa,” says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone extremely well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In projects like this, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to.”
Sprengisandur: Discuss the situation on the labour market, pension funds and much more
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, will attend Sprengisand, which starts at 10 a.m. on Bylgjan today.
He is also Minister of Labour and discusses the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also discusses rural issues and the relocation of jobs to the countryside, which has gone badly and been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of VR, will also appear on the show, where he will discuss his criticism of the investments of pension funds and put forward ideas for the trade union movement and employers to withdraw from the boards of the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
There will also be a discussion with Ívar Ingimarsson, tourism manager in Austurland, and Árnheiður Jóhannsdóttir, director of Markaðsstofa Norðurlands, about the situation in tourism in rural areas.
They will look forward to autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading omen of what is to come.
You can listen to the programme below, which starts at 10 a.m.
This is what she looks like today, 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teen dramas of all kinds.
She gained worldwide fame for her role as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also appeared in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills, 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has been seen of her lately, but she was given a chance to look back and comment on Clueless on Australian television these days.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I based the character mostly on girls I met at school who weren’t nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan said of his role in Clueless.
Refused to leave police station after overnight stay
About fifty cases came to the attention of the police in the Capital Region today and according to the police diary, the cases were varied.
The day at the Hverfisgata police station began with the police having to intervene with a man who had recently been released from prison for drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man earned a continued stay at the police station due to his conduct.
A man was arrested in the early morning on suspicion of burglary at a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to intervene with two men in Breiðholti due to a report of assault.
A woman who was eating in a shopping centre in Kópavogur could not pay the bill after the meal and was therefore called to the police.
A theft of a car was also reported in the city centre this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked away from her for a moment and she was then taken by force.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Were-Rabbit
The theory has taken flight on the Internet that a curse rests over the show about the cheerleader, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in recent days and thus became the third star of the show to die prematurely.
The Glee Club is a popular show about singing, dancing, and happiness.
The series focused on the so-called cheerleading team of teenagers in high school, their loves and fates.
It was not always easy to be in the cheerleading team, but through singing and dancing, the characters seemed to be able to overcome all the situations that arose in their lives.
But outside the set, disasters have befallen the cast and crew, so much so that theories have emerged that a curse rests on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera as Santana Lopez, a cheerleader who doesn't call everyone her grandmother.
After the series ended, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey, with whom she had her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband, and they subsequently divorced.
Dorsey refused to file a complaint, and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, Rivera was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found alone drifting in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and told police that he and his mother had jumped into the water and Rivera had brought him back to the boat but never returned.
There was a massive search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the chief of police in the area said that the search was based on the assumption that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially declared dead.
It is believed that she was caught in a strong current in the water and used her last claim to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded drunk by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith as Finn Hudson, an American football player with an angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Cheerleaders to prominence.
Outside the show, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and it proved difficult to get rid of it.
In 2013, his co-workers in the show felt it was enough, intervened and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into therapy and everything seemed to be looking for a better way.
Just two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
His death was caused by a fatal combination of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought to be an act of will.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for drugs had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well turned out to be fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was a heavy blow to his co-stars, but at the behest of his co-star Lea Michele, they decided to continue shooting and dedicated an entire episode to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling as Noah "Puck" Puckerman, a football player who, like Finn, had little respect for his cheerleader classmates, until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of possession of child pornography.
During a search of his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found, and the matter soon became public.
It was clear that Salling was done.
He was subsequently indicted and convicted of his crimes.
He faced four to seven years in prison, as well as being listed as a sexual offender and seeking treatment for pedophilia.
Before a judge had determined the sentence, Salling, who was then free on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not only the actors of the show who passed away prematurely.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director.
He died suddenly in his sleep in 2013, aged only 41.
There was also a woman named Nancy Motes who worked on the show.
She was the younger sister of Julia Roberts, and she did not like her sister's character, accusing her of being too controlling and disrespectful.
Motes committed suicide in 2014, suffering from severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé in which she blamed her mother and sister, among others, for the way she was treated.
“My mother and my so-called siblings will have nothing from me except the memory that they were the cause of my worst depression.”
Lea Michele was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and assaulting her co-stars on set and wearing obscene costumes.
Jesse Luken guest-starred in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunken driving in 2019, which was a major scandal.
Actress Heather Morris had a major role in the show.
In 2010, she was the victim of a cyberattack in which her nude photos were leaked to the Internet.
Actresses Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and had relationships outside of the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had abused her during the relationship.
Flowers can be placed on almost everything
It enhances the development of children when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and watch them grow and thrive.
There are also endless possibilities with flowers, as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a moment with the children in the park is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the scent and of course the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat after tenth grade
“I don’t think there are many sailors working in the country’s kindergartens,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who fishes in the summer and studies psychology at the University of Iceland in the winter.
Coastal fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it’s great to be able to avoid taking a student loan.
The income is also good enough for the winter,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old student of psychology, who is fishing this summer as he has in previous summers.
Axel had just moored in Tálknafjörður when a journalist reached out to him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.”
“In the winter when I was in the tenth grade, I took the boatmaster’s certificate for boats under twelve metres in length, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished primary school.
I have been fishing on my own boat every summer since.
I bought the boat used from my friend, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after him.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped sailing and he was very happy when he saw that the boat was named after him.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat,” says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished fishing.
So I had the boat debt-free at the end of my first summer on it.”
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay for a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“I had already made a deposit and saved money, I had been working with my father at sea when I was a boy, I was fishing with him every summer and got my share.
I also put my baptismal money in my boat fund.”
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all his maternal relatives are from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
“I am allowed to fish here in the western area because I have a legal residence with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I learned about these areas here in the west from paddling with my dad.
I move between fjords depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire Westfjords.
Although I prefer to be in the west, I have also fished around Snæfellsnes and elsewhere.
I have also fished in the south, but mostly for grayling," says Axel, who always rowes alone early in the morning and says he sometimes talks to the gulls and sings to the sky, while being alone for hours on end out on the sea.
“The internet connection at sea is good, so I can make calls, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't mind being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into trouble, but there have certainly been occasions when the weather has been bad, but there has never been much danger,” says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the fishing is going.
“In coastal fishing, I am never fishing for more than 14 hours at a time, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I have been continuously for one and a half days out at sea fishing.”
He says that the arrangements for coastal fishing allow him to catch 770 kilograms a day, which he finds inhibiting.
“Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I am only allowed to fish twelve days a month, during the four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is placed on people to calm down instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to choose as they see fit.
For my part, I would also like to see a division into zones, and sea areas that are well located near fishing grounds should be able to benefit from this,” says Axel, who mainly catches cod from salt water in his coastal fisheries, but only haddock and a few other species float along.
Axel works during the winter with his university studies at the kindergarten Núpi in Kópavogur.
“I don’t think there are many sailors working in the country’s kindergartens,” says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
“I got stuck there because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that my psychology studies will be useful to me at the preschool level in the future,” says Axel, who is also well advanced in his business studies.
Registration error prevented re-entry surveillance
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country meant that a person, resident in Iceland, was not called back for testing.
It is not required to enter a personal identification number if the person fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
"This will be examined this week," says a specialist at the Department of Public Health.
Three domestic infections were detected at the Department of Virology yesterday.
One of the persons who tested positive came to Iceland on 15 July, two days after the so-called re-entry quarantine rules came into effect.
Those who resided in Iceland are then screened upon arrival in the country and invited again for testing four to five days later.
In the afternoon news on RÚV, however, it was reported that the person concerned had followed the old system.
The sample taken at the border was negative and he was not called back to be tested for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist at the Department of Public Health, says in an interview with the news agency that this can be attributed to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English, they are not required to enter a personal identification number, as is the case in the Icelandic version.
After all, it was primarily intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person concerned did not receive an automatic invitation to come for testing.
Kamilla says that many people have followed the rules regarding re-entry quarantine even though they filled out the registration form in English, and in some cases, employers have also been vigilant about sending people for testing again after they arrived in the country.
"This will be examined this week how to make it easier for people to access this to raise awareness of the process."
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in quarantine.
They will all be tested, but two of them have started to show symptoms.
Tracing is now ongoing for the three cases that were detected yesterday, but it is largely completed for the two cases that were reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequencing by Icelandic Genomics has revealed that these are variants of the coronavirus that have not been detected in Iceland before.
In the second case, the links have been directed to Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus into the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be known tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation according to the website COVID.is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five cases unrelated
Five domestic infections have been detected in Iceland in recent days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and, for example, the source of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday has not been found.
Tracing is still ongoing.
Originally, about thirty individuals were sent to quarantine, but they were reduced to sixteen.
In total, 34 people are in quarantine due to these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that an infection has been detected at a sporting event and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, head of communications at the Public Safety Department of the Icelandic National Police, says that is possible, as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
“We are constantly urging all those who live here that it is necessary to maintain individual infection prevention.
We also need to make it clear to people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
Then you can hold events,” says Jóhann.
He says it is possible to prevent infection by maintaining individual infection prevention.
In addition, the rules and standards are under constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Health and the National Institute of Health are constantly urging people to do, is to consider these individual infection prevention measures.
Both at home and at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
This prevents the spread of the infection,” says Jóhann.
“We need to urge people to continue on the good path we were on, in order to be able to maintain the success we have achieved so far.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how hard her father was struggling to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, and she urged him to seek medical help.
He died the next day.
The death was attributed to sudden respiratory distress due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as the underlying cause, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that something similar will happen to her.
Reuters says Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
Figures from a new study commissioned by the US authorities show that almost 40% of those who died had diabetes 2 as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion rises to half.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in infectious diseases at the CDC, says the results are shocking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Reuters commissioned a survey and the answers from the 12 states that responded point to similar rates.
10 states, including California, Arizona and Columbia, have not yet started reporting underlying diseases.
“Diabetes was already a slowly growing epidemic.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful wave,” Reuters quoted Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American descent, who have also suffered worse from the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease under control with exercise, a healthy diet and the help of a healthcare professional.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
Furthermore, the high cost of insulin has forced some to continue to attend work and thus risk being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that the US authorities may have been aware of the danger that those with diabetes 2 could be posed by the virus.
During the SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and during the swine flu outbreak in 2009, this group was three times more likely to be hospitalised.
When MERS broke out in 2012, one study found that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a researcher at Yale University, says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could last longer, the pandemic has revealed a number of previously unknown complications.
“I’m afraid we’re going to see a tidal wave of problems once this is over,” says Andrew Bolton, president of the International Diabetes Federation.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetes-related complications, including kidney disease and kidney failure.
As well, new research suggests that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in cases of diabetes.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weakened in many people with diabetes.
In addition, a high ratio of glucose and lipids in diabetics can cause a veritable “cytokine storm”, as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
“It’s all one big puzzle,” says Dela Cruz.
“It’s all connected.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were offered champagne, then they left the room”
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason accepted the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was installing in Paris.
“We loved each other, so it wasn’t complicated.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
“I was very fascinated by it.
It was of course just the radiance, but I also thought she was incredibly cute.
And it still is,” he says.
Ásrún remembers this too, as her husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
“I’m hearing this story all the time.
Last time just this weekend,” says she, who was also attracted to her husband at first sight.
“I felt and still feel a lot of excitement around Atli, which I like.
There’s a lot going on and a lot happening, and I was fascinated by it.”
Atli says that the couple has emphasized in their relationship to go their own way.
“We do not tie our sacks with the same knots as our fellow travelers.
We avoid the routines that we see around us.”
That is probably why they welcomed the invitation from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson, although it was unusual to say the least.
“Our mutual friend Kristin Anna contacted us and asked if we could come to eat dessert with her, Ragnar and Ingibjörg, Ragnar’s wife, at Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had dessert wine and each their own dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who guided them through his plans for an art exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris that autumn.
“He had a multidisciplinary video work called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way.”
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from everyday Western life.
“He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot, and last he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in.”
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in was supposed to show a young middle-class couple making love in a minimalist room.
“This is intercourse with a beginning and an end,” says Atli.
The couple didn’t know Ragnar very well, although they knew him and he knew them, “but they knew us and thought we would fit in.
They said that they did not want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn’t get the right people, but people who would get sexually aroused from performing for others.”
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about the matter, but it did not take long.
“When we ran out of Snaps, we said, ‘Why don’t we just do this?
It was just the way it was.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team,” says Ásrún and Atli agrees.
“It’s all about love and closeness”
The scene was shot in a nice apartment on Myra Street.
There was a very small film crew; the cameraman, Ragnar, the sound engineer and the couple.
After the tape was turned on, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Ásrún.
“We hadn’t decided how we were going to be.
We were given some brief instructions, but we tried to forget the time and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
We didn’t act, we just loved each other, so it wasn’t complicated,” says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a bit romantic,” says Atli, and Ásrún agrees.
“We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on holiday in a fancy hotel in Paris.”
The team was pleased with the couple’s performance, which moved them.
“When Tommi the cameraman watched it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful,” says Atli.
“It’s as much about love and intimacy as it is about intercourse,” says Ásrún.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in his son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts to think about it,” says Atli.
“My mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone about it in that way, but then my dad just sent me a message and said: Nice to come across the little family at the Palais de Tokyo,” recalls Ásrún.
And did the participation in the play deepen the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
“At least we’re still together, so maybe it deepened something.
At least it deepened my relationship with my in-laws,” says Ásrún, laughing.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with a colleague.
“It was a little hard for me to be with someone else instead of you,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it’s just one scene in a much larger work and when you saw it with the other works, it’s really cool.
I was able to tear myself away from this and was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach,” says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple’s second child when the scene was shot.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Ásrún and Atli in Ástarsögur on Rás 1.
Swansea win first semi-final
Swansea won 1–0 at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the semi-finals for promotion to the English Premier League.
The match was played at Swansea City Stadium in Swansea, Wales.
The score at half-time was 0–0.
Swansea got a penalty in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew missed the penalty spot and let it go wide.
Just two minutes later, Brentford's Rico Henry was shown the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game with a man less, and in the 82nd minute, Swansea took advantage of that.
Andre Ayew scored the winning goal for Swansea in a 1–0 victory.
Swansea lead 1–0 in the first leg, but the second leg will be played next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
Without an ambassador for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in the limelight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard because he feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador to Iceland.
Since Carol Van Voorst stepped down as U.S. Ambassador at the end of April 2009, there has been no U.S. Ambassador in Iceland for a total of 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under strange circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have been awarded the Order of the Falkland Islands.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the Presidential Office stating that she would not be awarded the Order.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed before Van Voorst’s successor took office, in September 2010.
This may be partly due to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador but then resigned.
He was succeeded by Loius Ariega, who had served in the Foreign Service for decades.
In 2013, he resigned from his post and was appointed ambassador to Guatemala.
Then there was another period without an ambassador.
Barber was approved by the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and took office shortly thereafter, ending a 13-month absence of an ambassador.
Barber was politically appointed, not a diplomat, but had worked as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's election fund.
On January 20, 2017, Donald Trump took office as the 45th President of the United States.
The Trump administration took an unusually long time to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in Washington.
It took two years before the US Congress summoned Jeffrey Ross Gunter to their meeting to question him and confirm him as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the Parliament, he said that he had never visited Iceland, but frequently travelled to Western Europe, and that his wife, who is now deceased, was of Dutch descent.
Gunter is a politically appointed, formerly a dermatologist in California, and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The group was founded by casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who is an ardent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter arrived in Iceland in May 2019, after no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, the longest time in Iceland’s history.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration took to appoint people to key positions and that in recent years the work of the U.S. Congress has been dragging on for a long time, including confirming ambassadors in office.
Since 2009, there has been no ambassador in Iceland for over five years.
However, this has not prevented the construction of the Embassy, which recently opened its headquarters at Engjateig.
The construction is estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion. The building is surrounded by thick security walls and bulletproof glass in all windows.
However, this does not seem to be enough to fill the current ambassador with a sense of security, as he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former ÍBV player was racist in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former player of ÍBV, says he was racist when he was in Iceland and that he regrets having come to the country.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny that appeared in the Ugandan media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Iceland, where he played for ÍBV, Val and Þróttur.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I was used to.
The captain of the team was in that position, but in addition, he also had the shirt number I wanted, so I got neither of what I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right wing during the season with ÍBV.
Among other things, Tonny talks about the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when playing in Europe.
“This happened to me once, but because I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was being said.
Later I heard about the case and I asked my friend what the case was about.
He told me that my opponent made racist remarks about me after I tackled him.”
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he has made the mistakes he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to make it to the first team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
He then asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he then joined Valur.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had stayed longer in Norway, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, who hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He believes that the loan to Iceland ended his dreams of playing for a major club in Europe.
Found a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black worm in a woman's cervical gland.
The doctors managed to pull the worm out with pliers.
An investigation revealed that it was a parasitic infection.
CNN reports.
The woman had a few days before eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites like this are often found in raw meat or fish.
Since the advent of sushi in the West, the number of cases of parasitic infections has increased, according to CNN.
Fears of a second wave in Europe
Spain is now in the spotlight in connection with concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where the authorities have taken measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been frozen for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken measures due to the increase in infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to go into quarantine on returning from Spain, as in Norway, and French have been warned against traveling to Spain.
Infections are also rising again in France and Germany, where authorities are trying to find a balance between curbing the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to the rest of the world, but the incidence of infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 per day, with the most infections in America and South Asia.
Confirmed cases have reached 16 million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, and confirmed deaths related to the virus have reached 644,000.
Gerður’s mosaic works finally get to enjoy themselves to the fullest
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavík there is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large grave.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the pavement is good, and many people now stop and admire the artwork made of millions of mosaic tiles — as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least not seen it for themselves.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it were parking lots that were always occupied.
People parked there, locked their cars in a hurry and then jumped off to do their errands in the city center.
“Vibrant and diverse public spaces” and “attractive urban character” are the guiding principles for the ongoing redevelopment of Tryggvagötu.
The aim is to beautify the area and allow Gerður Helgadóttir’s mosaic work at the Tollhús to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work there will be a square and since the area is well exposed to the sun, it is considered to be well suited as a rest area for pedestrians.
The artwork will be illuminated and the material will now be able to enjoy itself better than before on this 142-square-meter surface.
There will also be small “fog sprayers”, a kind of water sculptures, which offer play and give the area a certain mystery.
In this way, the improvements are described by the City of Reykjavík, which is carrying out the works together with Veitur.
The water supply, heating and electricity lines will be renewed.
Many of them are old, but the sewer and cold water lines are from 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the city centre for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after the works, cars will be able to use it again.
However, it will be a one-way street, creating a quieter and more accessible space for pedestrians.
According to information about the Tollhúsið on the website of the Director of Customs, the building was taken into use in 1971 and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because the harbour shed extended through the house, there was a 250 square metre windowless wall area facing the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a surface would have a negative effect on the overall streetscape, unless special measures were taken to enhance the appearance of the building.
The parties therefore agreed to have a permanent artwork installed there.
During this time, Gerður Helgadóttir, an artist, was widely spoken of, says the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic works in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether to hold a competition for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the harbour, as the harbour had been Reykjavík’s lifeline since it was built.
When the artist was interviewed, she was instantly captivated by such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður was given the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home she put forward some proposals for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the work.
At the same time, Gerður was asked to sign an overall contract with the famous art company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, with whom Gerður had worked for a long time on the installation of famous artworks throughout Europe.
Negotiations succeeded and Gerður worked on the installation of the artwork in the workshop of the brothers, who then took care of the installation at Tollhúsið.
The whole work was done exceptionally well, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, says the summary.
It has since withstood the harsh Icelandic weather.
It took Gerður about two years to complete the work, which was finished and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after Tollhúsið was finished, aged only 47.
Prepares for relocation of more institutions
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be relocated in the near future.
This was said by the minister in the programme Sprengisandi on Bylgjan in the afternoon.
Recently it was announced that the fire department of the Housing and Structural Administration will be moved north to Sauðárkrókur this autumn.
Six fire specialists work for the agency, but none of them intend to follow the agency north and the National Fire and Rescue Association has criticized the relocations.
“I think we should take further steps in this direction.
I am preparing further steps in this being.
Further relocation," said Ásmundur.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions around the country.
“I think we need to take further political decisions on the transfer of public jobs to the countryside, as I was doing with the Housing and Civil Works Agency,” said Ásmundur, who also gave examples of other agencies that have been transferred to the countryside and were of great importance to communities in the countryside, such as the transfer of the Food and Drug Administration to Selfoss, the Icelandic Survey to Akranes and unemployment insurance to Skagaströnd.
All the highlights from the second day of the Championships
The 94th Icelandic Athletics Championships ended at Þórsvöllur in Akureyri today.
Some tournament records were set on the second day of the tournament.
Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Icelandic record in slingshot in 2014 and held it until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR broke the record in May last year.
Vigdís regained the Icelandic record earlier this summer and has been in fantastic form lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic record so far this summer.
Elísabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and did not recover today.
She had only one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 metres, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and set a tournament record.
Her Icelandic record she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters and she was therefore somewhat away from it.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day but she improved her best result with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men’s category, Hilmar Örn Jónsson of FH, who holds the Icelandic record in slingshot, won with a throw of 73.84 metres in his penultimate throw, setting a tournament record.
His personal best in the event is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympic athlete and Icelandic record holder in circle throwing, won the throw competition at Þórsvöllur yesterday but today he competed in circle throwing which is his main discipline.
Guðni Vals has an Icelandic record of 65.53 meters, but he threw 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw second longest today, but he had one valid throw that was enough for 2nd place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the Icelandic record holder in long jump, won the long jump competition with distinction. Hafdís jumped 6.25 meters today which is almost 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the women’s 200 metres, Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir of ÍR was the fastest, finishing in 24.04 seconds. Her Icelandic record for the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri as she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 meter race and in the 4 x 100 meter relay, and also in the 4 x 400 meter relay today.
In the men’s 200 metres, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson of FH finished first in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Máni Samúelsson of Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metres.
Will not be fined for 27 million króna Bitcoin harvest
The Tax Appeals Board has rejected the request of the Director of Tax Investigation to impose a fine on a man for understatement of his capital income arising from the sale of the electronic currency Bitcoin.
The Committee concludes that the Director of Internal Revenue had not provided clear arguments as to why it was necessary to impose a fine on the man.
The decision of the Committee states that the Director of Tax Investigation considered that the man had filed materially incorrect tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He had underdeclared his capital income from the sale of the electronic currency Bitcoin in the amount of 27 million, either intentionally or by gross negligence.
The man was fined for his behaviour.
The man denied this in a letter to the committee.
In 2016, it was estimated to have sold over 200,000 copies.
He would have acquired it by burial in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and inexpensive with a normal home computer.
He also pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrencies, the taxation of such sales had been considerably unclear and unpredictable.
It could hardly have been expected that ordinary citizens would disclose such arrangements on their tax returns.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and would have declared his assets on a return as a deposit in a foreign exchange account.
He had inquired with both experts and the Director of Internal Revenue about how this was done, but to no avail.
He also believed that it should be taken into account that he was not born or raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started mining for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to familiarise himself with complex rules on which the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion.
The man therefore considered it appropriate that his taxes for these two income years should be reassessed and a levy applied, but otherwise no penalty should be imposed.
He also reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have intended to evade his responsibilities in an improper manner.
The demand for guilt would be excessive and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur attracts attention: “This man understands what football is about”
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been the subject of a lot of controversy, but he has also been praised for his performance so far this season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max League.
Blikar will be in the line of fire tonight when they take on ÍA in a live broadcast on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur will be suspended for four matches this season and will therefore not appear with a new haircut as in the games of the summer so far.
He had had “bla, bla, bla” written on his head before the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I don't know exactly who he was responding to with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was really trying in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was someone going to equalize this game, I thought he would do it or create it," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stands, when speaking to Brynjólfur.
“I’m supposed to be here for the people.”
“Sometimes it’s hard to figure out what position he’s in.
He looks a bit out on the left side as the games go on, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólfur is a real entertainer and is delighted to have such a colourful man in the team: “Nobody disputes that he has character.
This is a funny guy and I love the hair thing, and to be always ready to show up and answer interviews.
There is an incredible amount of people interested in him, which tells me that this man understands what football is about.
“I’m an entertainer.
I’m supposed to be here for the people and have fun.”
People are reading the interviews with Brynjólfur, people are paying in and watching what’s next on his hair.
This man is just a genius,” said Máni.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in touch with a few teams in the B-League"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max League, appears to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Fotbolti.net also reported on the case.
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country, but to do so, he must first terminate his contract with KR as the Danish league starts before the Icelandic one ends.
The club knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding,” Tobias told Bold.
“I have been in touch with several teams in the B-League and will probably switch before the end of the Icelandic season.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract with KR.”
He also says that he will probably have to accept a salary cut in Denmark.
“Companies in Denmark have probably felt the economic impact of the virus more than in Iceland.”
Bicycle whisperer Bjartmar has recovered bicycles worth millions - Now responds after DV coverage
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He finds and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, e-bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the nickname "the bicycle whisperer" as a result.
Yesterday there was quite a stir when a man published an account of his interactions with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to discussions on the Facebook group Vesturbæingar where it was stated that Bjartmar had talked to the man on Austurvöllur and said the scooter might have been stolen.
It was not possible to read anything else from the original writings of the electric shuttle driver but that Bjartmar had stolen him.
That text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial reports of the case are not at all representative of what really happened yesterday at Austurvöllur.
Bjartmar said he had received information from a victim of electric shuttle theft that these were indeed their electric shuttles.
The alleged owner got that information from someone else, but the information turned out to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
“I saw the guy and I recognized the shuttle, as I had information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and had been searched for.
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to drive away on the shuttle, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
I’m usually very polite about these things, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken my word.”
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter immediately asked him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
“Yeah, great,” said Bjartmar, “let’s get this straight.”
So the owner of the electric taxi proved ownership of his electric taxi and drove off.
Later, the rightful owner of the electric scooter shared his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
In the year and a half that Bjartmar has been practicing this sport, he says he can count the times he has run into people on the fingers of one hand.
“I have had peaceful interactions with the most difficult people in Reykjavík,” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the least brothers and sisters of society, addicts, people with mental disabilities and other people who for some reason are on the streets.
“Fishing is a tough master and somehow you have to finance the next dose, unfortunately theft of this kind of cash is an easy way to that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My relationship with these people is actually so good that I have a lot of good people on my team.
There are examples of people who have gone to therapy and recovered and then came to me and helped me with what I’m doing,” he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s interactions with cyclists are on a polite note.
Some people know about him and what he is doing and peacefully offer to show him receipts, bike numbers and so on.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has been little discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even starting to tell people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the previous reporting of DV and says he is not some kind of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked whether he is still on slippery ice with his actions, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says that he certainly is.
“Of course the police should do this, but the fact is that the police are simply not doing this.
I have, for example, watched police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen bikes.
She is frankly powerless in these matters.”
“When the police are not doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can achieve success in this area, then why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He says he has been so successful in tracking down stolen bikes that sometimes when he encounters his “clients” on the street, they simply hand over the bikes they had stolen to Bjartmar.
The times Bjartmar has called for police assistance, it has happened that they simply do not show up.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault and it’s not the owners of the bikes’ fault,” said Bjartmar, and he is sorry that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer from the police’s inaction in this matter.
The success of Bjartmar is not disputed.
There are many stories of people thanking Bjartmar for bringing their belongings back to them.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long since lost track of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts probably run in the millions, if not tens of millions.
Electric scooters, e-bikes and electric shuttles weigh heavily, but an e-bike can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a kindergarten during the day and every other weekend he works at a residential school.
His bicycle search is therefore unpaid work that he does in his free time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was an important anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Civil servants had received pensions from the King of Denmark since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for civil servants was established, which eventually became a pension fund for all public employees.
The basis for the current pension funds for ordinary wage earners was laid by collective labour agreements in 1969, which provided for compulsory membership and full funded employment-related pension funds from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, a law was passed on the basis of these agreements and the pension system continued to strengthen after that.
The wage-earner pension system was not the only radical change that the 20th-century labour movement forced through its wage struggles.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar way in the historic strikes of 1955, and the unions also gradually achieved their demands for sick leave and health insurance, substantial holiday entitlements, shortened working hours, housing reforms and other matters of great importance.
All these rights cost a great and tough struggle but proved, in retrospect, to be a much greater and more lasting improvement than the increase in the number of aurar in the salary envelope, which disappeared as hard as it did in the high of inflation that characterized the post-war period and until 1990 as many remember.
The process leading up to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although it was eventually agreed that the funds would in practice be owned by their members, the labour movement had to agree that their boards should be appointed with equal representation of employers and members.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers in the boards of the funds was frequently discussed in the unions of wage earners, but it was never implemented, and therefore we still sit with the abnormal arrangement that representatives of the fund members are not in the majority in the boards of the funds.
Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on compulsory insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
Paragraph 1 states that “a pension fund shall be guided by the interests of its members.”
Paragraph 5 also states: “A pension fund shall establish ethical standards for its investments.”
The shareholder policy of the Merchants’ Pension Fund contains, among other things, the following provisions, in continuation of the aforementioned statutory provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors overseas and in Europe.
The guidelines discuss how a focus on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improved investment performance of portfolios.
Thus, the interests of investors and the goals of society in a broader context come together.
LV believes it is important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, establish public policies on: good governance working conditions social responsibility and environmental issues.
The pension fund Gildi, which is one of the largest pension funds in the country, has adopted a “policy on responsible investment” with similar provisions.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to the latest buzzword in Icelandic, “shadow management”.
Since the word is new in the language, it is unlikely that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "most taken": Shadow management is when a leader of a trade union says in the media that he intends to send the representatives of the union on the board of a pension fund recommendations or instructions on how they should take a position on a particular issue.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the earliest opportunity.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about dismissal, then it is not "shadow management" because such communications between people are of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I leave it to the reader to ponder which way he finds “shady.”
There are two men in particular who have tried to formulate this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, Governor of the Central Bank.
The issue for both of them arose after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, announced his intention to terminate the company’s contracts with flight attendants and stewardesses, and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Chamber of Commerce, issued a recommendation to its representatives on the board of the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce Pension Fund not to support the fund’s possible purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they could be forced to resign.
Shortly thereafter, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and Ragnar Þór followed suit with his recommendations, which were of course based on Bogi Nils’s decision.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw a reason to comment on the issue in the Friday edition of Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow governance, violation of the law and the urgent need for amendments to the law.
There, a small mound was indeed to carry a heavy burden, although the blessed mound had been in conjunction and had also been wiped out quickly.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the subject itself at the end.
I have previously described the relevant provisions of the Pension Funds Act.
These include that fund boards must safeguard the interests of fund members and have ethical standards in investments, and these points are elaborated in more detail in the articles of association of both Gildi and the Pension Fund of the Merchants, as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT focus solely on short-term profitability in their investments.
Such a policy would be extremely dangerous, and we do not need to look far in the past to find examples of it, where large loans from banks and funds have gone to unethical adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on slippery ice when he thought of wiping out an entire group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-à-vis investors.
Fortunately, he saw it and took it back.
Time will tell whether this is sufficient to ensure that the investment of pension funds in the company can be considered responsible towards the fund members in the end.

One of the infected did not follow home quarantine
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in Iceland yesterday came to the country from a Baltic state on 15 July, about one and a half weeks ago.
He is an Icelandic citizen who is not a resident of Iceland by standard age and therefore did not receive clear instructions to follow the so-called return surveillance after arriving in Iceland and to undergo a second test a few days after arrival.
He tested negative at the border.
“But he is in Icelandic society and should actually have gone to that facility,” says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a specialist in the Department of Public Health at the National Institute of Health and deputy of the Director of Public Health while he is on summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the personal identification number and if the personal identification number is not registered, you are not automatically invited to the second sample."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad, but because of his network in the country as an Icelandic, he should have used the Icelandic one.
However, he did not realise this.
“When the personal identification number is not registered, you have to apply for a second sample yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seems to have realized that it was the right way,” says Kamilla.
“So it is clear that we need to strengthen the information about this while we find a way to make an automatic notification system even if Icelanders do not register their social security number.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are participants in the Icelandic society in the registration system,” she explains.
Fortunately, the person does not associate with many people upon arrival in the country, although he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelandic.
Only six people have been sent to quarantine after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They have yet to be tested, but two of them are showing symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man tested negative at the border on 15 July.
Kamilla says it is likely that he was so recently infected with the virus that she could not yet detect it in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not bring the virus with him to the country.
“It is not entirely possible to argue that this is certainly an imported infection because it is so long ago that he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused a little fuss in connection with the sports tournaments.”
However, she says that is very unlikely because of the small number of people he socialized with here.
“It’s actually very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but adds that it cannot be ruled out until Íslensk erfðagreining has sequenced the virus in the man.
“If we get a type of virus that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that he has brought it to Iceland.”
Pepper spray and bombs used against protesters
There were clashes between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
The police used pepper spray and non-lethal hand grenades, but the protesters broke windows and set fire to them.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Protests against police brutality and racism took place across the United States last night, with protests in Seattle in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, a protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
In the aftermath, police said the protests were riots, and clashes broke out between groups of protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police in August last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of Black National Guard members gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and marched in parades to closed intersections where police separated the group from a group of protesters who also carried firearms.
Seventy-five people were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters commemorated James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defined our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Manchester United manager, doesn't want to overstate the importance of the game against Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose to Wolves, Solskjær and his men end in 5th place and lose their Champions League spot.
However, they still have a chance to qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
“We are not at the end of the road.
If we score against Leicester I think people will say we haven’t had a bad season,” Solskjær said.
"Whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a long way to go to catch up with the two teams above us," Solskjær said.
It is clear that people will be nervous at 15:00 today, but Solskjær tried to act as if it was just another game.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the final game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is what the club is built on.
We’ve created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it’s up to us to make the most of it,” Solskjær said.
“This is not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results don’t define our season, we’ve already had many moments that define this season.”
"The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I think overall we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than last season," Solskjær said.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new coronavirus infections were detected in the United States yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 cases have been confirmed overseas since the beginning of the epidemic there.
900 people died from the virus yesterday, compared to more than 1,000 deaths per day in the previous four days.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to the CNN report, according to the forecast model of the US health authorities, the number of deaths due to the virus will reach 175,000 by August 15.
Fearing a second wave of the pandemic
The Spanish government is currently struggling to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID—19, both on Thursday and Friday.
This is the highest number of new cases in a single day since the beginning of May, and the news comes as Spain begins to lift one of the strictest curfews in Europe.
The setback led to the UK authorities now requiring passengers arriving from Spain to quarantine upon return.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where the authorities have introduced more restrictions to try to stem the growth.
In the capital, Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and retirement homes will have to close at midnight.
In addition, a curfew is now in effect for 200,000 residents in the Segria county in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected by the pandemic.
Tui, the UK’s largest tour operator, cancelled all flights scheduled for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for a second wave of the pandemic, but there seems to be little interest in reverting to the extensive curfews that have ruined economies.
For example, Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken it very badly and compared it to a nuclear weapon that he does not want to use.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex said the nation “would not survive, economically or socially,” if a nationwide curfew were to be re-introduced.
Many officials are hoping that local measures that reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities or regions will be enough to contain the virus in the next round if it comes.
Five new cases in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two more at the border.
Thus, five people were diagnosed with a positive Covid-19 infection yesterday in Iceland.
One of the cases is linked to the case reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavík and, according to the announcement, “only part of the sports team” is in quarantine.
Others who were sent to quarantine are related to the man in another way.
The source of this infection has not been identified and the Director of Police’s infection tracking team is in full swing.
The organizers of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the guidelines and rules of the Health Minister and the Public Health Authority that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures of the tournament yesterday drew attention where you could see in very close contact celebrating the good performance of his team out on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the organizers posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says "NOTE: Parents please respect the rules that competitors collect their own stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do this.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection reported the day before.
The announcement says: "Icelandic Genomics has sequenced the infections and a new type of virus has been detected that has not been detected before."
Tracing is also being carried out in this case and the infected person is in isolation and 12 are in quarantine due to the infection.
The third case in question is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, on 15 July.
It is located in the southwestern corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already showing symptoms of the virus.
In addition, two cases were detected at the border and the results of further tests are awaited, as required by the procedure for infections at the border.
The Department of Public Safety of the Icelandic National Police and the Office of the National Physician urge people to be cautious and pay close attention to individual infection prevention.
If there is the slightest doubt as to whether symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the person is asked to go for testing at the nearest health centre.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite is fully booked for the weekend - Directs visitors elsewhere
The camping area in Patreksfjörður is fully booked for the weekend, according to Vesturbyggð.
Guests are advised to explore other accommodation options.
Vesturbyggð mentions Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes á Rauðasandi, Hótel Flókalund and Hótel Breiðavík as other options.
There is plenty going on in Patreksfjörður this weekend, because as in previous years, Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic documentary films, will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging by the attendance at the campsite, good attendance can be expected this year, if the weather does not set a line in the account, but DV said earlier today from a poor forecast.
However, the worst weather can be expected in the south, and hope for the inhabitants of Patreksfjörður.
The website bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
Entire apartment building rots down in the best location in the city
Romanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18-20.
In the meantime, the owners are applying for a building permit for renovations, but their application has been hovering in the system for almost three years.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive neighbourhoods of Reykjavík stands a large three-storey apartment building.
On the ground floor of the building is about 600 square meters of retail space.
Behind the house are the doors of two staircases, each containing four rather spacious apartments.
They range in size from 93 to 130 square meters, most of them over 100.
The house has a lot of history.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted a video rental, a shoe shop, a dairy store, a gunsmith, a fish shop and most recently a university print shop.
The house has, to say the least, lost its beauty.
The house is now under severe damage, as can be seen in the attached pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
According to the company register, the owners of D18 ehf. are, among others, Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús led the owners’ group of Borgun and was the managing director of the holding company Borgun.
Among the owners of the holding company Borgun is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is an investment company owned by Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún also owns a one-third stake in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once ran the shipyard Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore had little or no maintenance since then.
Neighbors say that the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since then, but mostly in recent years.
On the Facebook page of residents in the neighborhood, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly lively in recent years".
This may be due to the fact that the owners have wanted to change the house and the plot for several years.
Other neighbors say the house has not been in order for a long time.
“It’s long overdue to do something properly about this spot and it’s sad that it has taken so long.”
He also says that he is angry at the owners of the house for not hurrying to finish this, finding some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stopping this "legal mess".
“Just do this in consultation with the community around so we can hurry up and finish it.”
The “legal mess” that the resident refers to is the planning process for the site, which has been ongoing since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build a floor above the existing apartment building and behind the building, a new elevator house and an extension on one floor plus a basement.
The building permit granted for that project was appealed to the Appellate Board for Environmental and Resource Matters, and the board declared it null and void as the project was not supported by a zoning plan and the neighbourhood consultation was insufficient.
The City of Reykjavik then embarked on the zoning process and finished it with an announcement in the Official Gazette in July last year.
That plan was also appealed and the committee annulled it in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house were just starting.
By this time, the house had deteriorated considerably and the neighbours were getting tired of it.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and the reaction of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some people understood the intentions of the owners of the house, others did not at all.
Some directed their anger at the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily at anyone.
Others said the parking lots were a point of contention, but neighbours have used the unused parking lots at Dunhaga 18–20 for their vehicles.
One of the complainants in the case said he was tired of the administration:
“The fact that we have to go through the process three times is absolutely unbelievable.
It’s like the City of Reykjavik couldn’t read.”
Today the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the fleeting administration of the city and the noble intentions of the owner and their many years of work that is now in its infancy.
When a journalist visited the garden at Dunhaga 18, he was struck by wide-open doors and piles of rubbish.
A Playstation and a new TV lay among other rubbish on the ground — victims of the icy summer rain.
There was an opening into the old office of Háskólaprents and there were a lot of cats, judging by the smell.
It is clear that someone has nested in one corner, but no one is visible.
Piles of couches and beds and a few pallets of geology papers, undoubtedly meant to become a book, came to mind.
The stairwells of the apartment building were also open and full of life.
A journalist was lucky enough to come across an inhabitant of one of them.
Some Romanians were cooking potatoes for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the temporary employment agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and DV sources say that the company has paid nothing for the premises except for heating and electricity.
Due to the condition of the building, it is not reasonable to charge rent.
From the post boxes in the lobby of the house it is clear that a number of foreign workers have lived there in recent years.
Temporary employment agencies have not been unaffected by the Covid-19 situation, as a decline in tourism has led to a decline in the construction sector, and these two industries have been the most active in using temporary employment agencies.
Nevertheless, the residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do and hung their coats and mittens in the common area to dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist said goodbye to the boys in Romanian, the irony suddenly became clear to him: In the best location in Reykjavík, a 1,500-square-meter property is dilapidated.
The owners want to change the house for the better and the neighbours want to improve the situation but disagree on the definition of “improvement”.
In between, the city’s planning department is sitting on the starting block, victim of endless appeals and appeals in the planning process and summary decisions of the Appeals Board on Environmental and Resource Issues.
Romanian workers live in the house, perhaps the ones who will improve the situation when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article originally appeared in the weekly newspaper DV on 17 July.
In a campaign against obesity in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will allocate £10 million to a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his serious illness, partly due to his weight.
The campaign, entitled Better Health, is scheduled to be presented by Johnson tomorrow, Monday, and will encourage doctors to prescribe cycling for overweight patients, as well as launch an effort to increase the number of bicycle paths.
Fast food advertisements on television will also be banned before 9pm, according to British media sources.
“COVID-19 has awakened us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier,” the government spokesman said.
Johnson himself has been struggling with weight problems, but he was admitted to the intensive care unit when he contracted the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly because of his weight that he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Women better placed to lead the change
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step that the nation could take towards greater decentralization, transparency and in working against corruption and in the interests of the whole.
“We need to start changing gears a little now, and who is better placed to lead such changes than the group of society that has easier time staying in these values.
It’s women,” Helga said.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their solidarity.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
So now it’s up to us to lead this change.”
She said she was a little concerned about the emphasis on Iceland as “best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“Then we are not as willing to look at what needs to be done.
As the Germans are very aware of their history and examine everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We must know where we are coming from and know the history and listen.
Listening to the voices of marginalised groups.
We don’t all live under the same rules here,” Helga said.
When asked, she said that women are in many ways in good shape in Iceland, but added that as in many other places, Icelanders live with extremely masculine values.
She said that politics revolved around self-interest, domination and power, which were the forces that perpetuated inequality in all societies.
“Women have now formed this group and come together and are just getting a little frustrated that the Althing is going to repeatedly ignore this national referendum from 2012,” she said.
“It’s these feminine values that we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values of the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country in terms of natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people here who live in poverty.
It’s ridiculous, we can do it differently,” Helga said.
“It’s ridiculous that there is a law of nature that women’s jobs are always lower paid.
It’s ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to fight endlessly just to get a decent salary.”

Tried to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city center last night after he threatened a pedestrian and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbæ, where two people were arrested in connection with the case.
In addition, the police stopped a motorcyclist in Hlíðar, who was driving at 146 km/h where the speed limit is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his driving licence.
The police in the Capital Region had a lot to do last night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday until five this morning.
At that time, there were a lot of noise notifications due to parties.
On Saturday night, reports of eleven noisy parties were received and it was a lot in the police diary.
Tonight, however, 22 noise cases were reported to the police.
Six were placed in jail this night.
In Árbæjarsafn, police were called to the scene last night when fireworks were fired.
However, they had already escaped when police officers arrived at the park.
In addition, nine drivers were stopped for drunk driving and/or driving under the influence of drugs.
Four people were arrested in connection with a fight in the city centre last night. One of them was placed in a jail cell.
Two people were taken to the emergency department after falling on their faces, one in the city centre and the other in Vesturbæ.
One person was taken to the emergency department after being injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who was towing a trailer in Kjalarnes yesterday.
The trailer's wheels were, according to the police diary, in "very bad condition" and it was detained.
You can stay in Monet's house during the shopping weekend
The house, where impressionist Claude Monet spent the last 40 years of his life, is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next free nights in the house are during the weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet first found inspiration to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb page, it’s next available in a week, on the Sunday of the shopping weekend, so it might be ideal for some shopping people on holiday to hurry up and book the painter’s house.
The two nights over the weekend cost only 964 US dollars or just over 130 thousand Icelandic crowns as far as Fréttablaðið knows.
Dozens in quarantine and some of them starting to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens of people have been quarantined due to this and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three people were diagnosed with the coronavirus in Iceland yesterday and two at border screening.
An expert at the National Institute of Health says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in society.
“It has been sequenced from the previous domestic infection and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no special reason to think that it has been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very vigilant now,” said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, a specialist in the Department of Public Health.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling will take place in the near future, but several people who were in contact with the infected are starting to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Now there is no influenza and fewer other respiratory infections, so we can be fairly liberal with doing these tests on individuals who during the influenza season would have found it reasonable to do something else first,” said Kamilla.
Tracing is mostly completed, but it is not impossible that more people will have to go into quarantine.
Two of the infections were detected after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions as to whether it is responsible to hold such events.
The Public Safety Liaison Officer says that is possible as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
Kamilla says it is almost impossible that the infected people were infected at the sports tournaments.
“If no more people go into isolation from these individuals after interacting with them at these sports events, we can claim that our precautions at the events have worked.
But it has not been revealed," said Kamilla.
The procedures of the Public Safety Department are under constant review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems warranted,” said Kamilla.
In just over a week, it is planned that the number of people will be expanded to 1,000.
This new situation could have an impact on easing.
"Cooking is a kind of meditation" - See Elísa Vidar's menu
Elina Vidarsdóttir is an athlete in football and plays for Valur.
She is also a master’s student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the hustle and bustle of the day and usually gives herself time to cook good and nutritious food.
A normal day for me starts with arriving at work at eight o’clock,” says Elísa.
“After work, I go to the grocery store so I can prepare dinner before I pick up my daughter at kindergarten around three o’clock.”
Elisa finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter early in kindergarten.
“It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice in the afternoon.
After training, it’s nice to come home and just have to heat up the food.
At night, when the girl has fallen asleep, we like to watch one episode to clear our minds.”
Elisa doesn’t follow a specific diet.
She is finishing her master’s thesis in nutrition and therefore knows exactly what she needs to eat to have enough energy for work, school, family and exercise.
“What suits me is to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food as bad or good, rather nutritious or non-nutritious.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.”
Elisa is very interested in cooking.
“I find a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen cooking and therefore draw a lot from it.
I have to say that I feel confident in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I am a good chef.”
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, soaked in almond milk overnight.
Top this meal with what is available at the time.
Usually it’s a banana and crispy muesli & COFFEE.
I'm a big coffee girl.
Snacks: Incredibly varied, but fruits or vegetables, flatbreads, plain skyr with bananas and muesli, bread with toppings and I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if necessary.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of nutritious salads from what I have in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel balls, rock salad, baked vegetables with a good dressing is a bit of what I am working with.
If the planning goes completely out of control (which happens a lot) then the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often and then it’s 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, I’m not putting more on you.
Snacks: I eat something high in carbohydrates before training, bread with spreads, cereals or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often the choice in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle
The city of Seattle, Washington, has declared a state of emergency following massive protests in downtown.
Police yesterday used tear gas and pepper spray to try to clear a large area occupied by protesters, which stretched over several blocks in the vicinity of the parliament building in the city.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into vandalism at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
City and police authorities say protesters threw rocks, bottles, grenades and other loose objects at police, and one policeman was taken to hospital for treatment.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
They were blown to show solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there have been repeated clashes between protesters and heavily armed federal police.
There, like in other US cities, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, commemorating Georges Floyd, who was killed by a policeman in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding reforms.
Not revoked until after voting
It is not yet clear whether the dismissals of Icelandair’s flight attendants, which are due to take effect at the end of next month, will be revoked.
The electronic voting on the collective bargaining agreement of the Icelandic Aircrew Association on behalf of Icelandair’s aircrew will end tomorrow at noon.
Icelandair’s chairman, Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, says she is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the layoffs until the outcome of the vote is known.
“There’s definitely a connection,” says Guðlaug Líney.
“No redundancies have been withdrawn, this must be available so that the aircraft can be manned.
And of course, people are eager to know if they will have a job after the end of the month.”
The agreement to be voted on was signed a week ago, on the night of 19 July.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that was previously voted down by the flight attendants.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Board of Trustees of Icelandair agreed to announce a general strike at Icelandair.
It never took place, but this was decided in the wake of Icelandair’s decision to end negotiations with Flugfreyjufélagið, dismiss all its flight attendants and seek agreements with another trade union.
In addition, the company's pilots were to temporarily take over the duties of security officers on board.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it is difficult to say.
“People are in pain after this aggression by Icelandair, when all the airline’s flight attendants were dismissed and announced that they would be negotiating with another union.
Now we’ll see if it has an impact,” she says.
Icelandair employed 940 flight attendants at the end of April, but 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
Their notice period varies in length, with those with the shortest working life having a notice period of three months, which ends at the turn of July and August.
About 90% of Icelandair’s flight attendants belong to this group.
What happens if the agreement is not approved?
“Then we ask for continued negotiations with our negotiators.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair’s requirements.
If it is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants feel that it has gone too far.”
Voting on collective bargaining agreement ends and Icelandair announces second quarter results tomorrow
Flight attendants’ vote on a new collective bargaining agreement ends tomorrow at 12 noon.
Icelandair’s second quarter results will also be released tomorrow, and preliminary results indicate that the company’s revenue fell by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic vote on the collective bargaining agreement between Icelandair and Samtök atvinnulífsins began on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday, 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who may vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to Flugfreyjufélagið.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective bargaining agreement late on Sunday 19 July, after Icelandair ended negotiations with FFÍ on Friday after the cabin crew voted against the previous agreement in early July.
Icelandair had dismissed all of its stewardesses and flight attendants on Friday, but the strike was withdrawn after a new collective bargaining agreement was signed.
According to the new collective agreement, flight attendants will have to fly five hours more a month for the same basic salary.
The collective agreement is valid until 2025 and includes provisions for pilots and flight attendants on how long they may fly in one shift.
The agreement was presented to FFÍ members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and many flight attendants who were interviewed by the news agency expressed their dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Most of them, however, seemed to agree that the agreement had to be approved in order to keep the FFÍ alive.
Icelandair’s second quarter results will be presented tomorrow. According to preliminary results, the company’s EBIT, its operating profit before capital expenditures and taxes, is negative by about USD 100 to 110 million, or about ISK 15 billion.
Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to the Stock Exchange last Wednesday, which said that the company’s revenue amounted to about 60 million dollars in the quarter, or about 8.3 billion ISK.
Cash and cash equivalents were approximately USD 154 million at the end of the quarter, or approximately ISK 21 billion.
Icelandair is also planning to offer its shares in August.
Icelandair aims to finalise agreements with 15 lenders, the government and aircraft manufacturer Boeing by the end of the month before launching a public offering.
A new strain rather than a new type of virus
“A new virus just means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been simmering in Iceland,” says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at the National Hospital’s Department of Infectious Diseases, about the news that a “new type of virus” has been detected in Iceland.
Three domestic cases were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One person who was diagnosed had participated in the social activities of a sports club at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the source of the infection has not been found and infection tracing is ongoing.
An infection was also detected in a person who came to Iceland on 15 July and two people who were in contact with him have started to show symptoms of COVID-19.
In addition, an infection was detected yesterday that is related to an infection reported the day before, and after sequencing at Icelandic Genomics, “a new type of virus that has not been detected here before” was revealed.
Tracing has been completed in connection with that infection.
Már points out that this is not a new virus, but rather the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more appropriate to speak of a new strain of that virus than of a new type of virus.
Asked what this means and whether it could mean that a second wave of the pandemic has begun, Már says that at the moment it is an isolated case and that it could turn out to be nothing more.
“On the other hand, if there are cases within Iceland that do not have links from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, it would be possible to draw that conclusion [about a second wave], but it is premature at this point,” Már explains.
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to Icelandic happiness hidden in hot tubs?
BBC programmers shed light on the country’s swimming pool and hot tub culture in an entertaining video.
The Icelandic bathing culture is unique in the world and it is claimed that nowhere else in the world there are as many bathing places per inhabitant.
Natural geothermal heat is the basis of this, but also the tradition of swimming that prevails here.
Swimming lessons for children were made mandatory by law in 1940, but older citizens are no less active in using the hot water for their health.
Swimming trips are described as a fixed part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and status.
Free from mobile phones, people converse on a personal note about worlds and space or enjoy the healing power of water: meditate and recharge the batteries of soul and body.
On the steep to seek a hundred days in elections
There are 100 days until the Americans go to the polls to elect a president for a four-year term.
Donald Trump is running for re-election, but he has a steep path ahead of him.
Joe Biden, the prospective Democratic nominee, has a large lead over Trump at the national level, according to opinion polls.
According to a new poll by the AP news agency, a record number of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic is also very unpopular, and more Americans than before believe that the president has handled the economy poorly.
In fact, only two in ten Americans say the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump’s response to the pandemic and 48 percent say he has managed the economy well.
In March that percentage was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to FiveThirtyEight, Biden holds 49.9 percent of the national vote, while Trump holds 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention away from his own performance in dealing with the pandemic to Biden, pushing for so-called cultural conflicts and advocating policies that are supposed to focus on law and order.
However, the Biden campaign is keen to keep the attention on Trump and believes it has a good chance of winning if the election is really about how Trump has performed in office over the past four years.
Trump's unpopularity also seems to be affecting Republican congressmen, and the Progressives fear that the Democrats could even achieve a majority in the US Senate, which so far has been considered very unlikely.
Politico recently reported that the Republican Party would suffer its worst defeat in decades if the party and candidate support remained comparable as it is now.
The outskirts proved particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections and it looks like that trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to intimidate suburban residents to follow him, among other things, by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will ruin the suburbs of the United States and push for racial divisions.
Among other things, Trump has repealed a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He then urged the "housewives" of the U.S. suburbs to read an article by a former assistant governor of New York, where she claimed that Biden would destroy the U.S. suburbs, and Trump agreed.
“Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it better!” said the President.
Residents of the U.S. suburbs are an ever-growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush's re-election in 2004, the candidate who has won the majority of this group's votes has been elected president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received the majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that although Trump secured a narrow majority in the suburbs in 2016, his support there has shrunk significantly.
Although it varies between polls, Biden has shown a fifteen percentage point lead over Trump in recent outpouring.
Regis Philbin is dead
Regis Philbin has died at the age of 88.
Philbin has worked as an actor, host, presenter, and singer for more than six decades.
He is best known for hosting the popular talk show Live! with Regis from 1988 to 2011 with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has hosted shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to the Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has spent the most hours on American television.
He won six Emmy Awards during his career and was nominated 37 times.
According to a statement from his family, Philbin died of natural causes.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have remembered him on social media over the past 24 hours.
Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision was made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event interrupted only by world wars, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic torch would be “the light at the end of the tunnel,” presumably referring to the coronavirus pandemic that the world is now facing together.
Athletes have an additional year to prepare, and the Japanese government will reimburse the costs of the delay.
But everyone keeps their heads high, because there's a lot at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the venue for this year’s Olympic Games, the celebrations of the Japanese delegates were genuine.
They laughed and cried, as Tokyo had applied to host the Games in 2016, but was defeated by Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to bathe in the attention of the world.
The Games were originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, but were postponed to 23 July to 8 August 2021.
If the Games cannot be held then, if the coronavirus continues to be too much of a threat, the Games will be cancelled.
However, no one wants to think that thought to the end.
The Olympics are no ordinary sporting competition.
Nothing is spared, the show must always be spectacular and strive to top the last play.
The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on a selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.
The more spectacular the presentation, the greater the chance of winning the prize.
Tokyo spent $150 million on the bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games.
The second time, when applying for the 2020 Games, 75 million dollars, about ten billion crowns, were put into the application.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the Games, the Japanese authorities had already committed ISK 30 billion to the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build an Olympic village, stadiums and generally to strengthen the country's infrastructure to cope with such a tournament, prepare it and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be running these days but have been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by Japan’s National Audit Office, published at the end of last year, suggested that the cost was more than twice that figure.
The cost of postponing the Games is unlikely to be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it could cost between $2 billion and $6 billion in addition to the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore range from $ 15 billion to $ 30 billion.
These figures are so high that all tax revenue of the Icelandic state would only be enough for about half the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have become the subject of economics, which tries to analyze the numbers and examine the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, quite a few people seem to have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympic Games is less than positive for the economies of the cities that host them.
The short-term effects are some, for example, there is a huge increase in jobs in the short term, but in the longer term, cities tend to be left with debt and high operating costs of underutilized infrastructure.
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is in considerable debt from the 2016 Games and has been struggling to pay for the maintenance of all the major sports facilities built for the Games.
A review of figures after the London 2012 Olympics revealed that only 10 per cent of those employed during the Olympics were previously unemployed.
This means that no new jobs were created except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not fared particularly well financially hosting the Olympic Games due to the overwhelming costs associated with the infrastructure built for the Games.
However, benefits are often attributed to the increased number of tourists wishing to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, although there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to accommodate the full number of spectators that normally attend the Games.
The most important thing, however, is the honour of being chosen, which is difficult to measure in monetary terms.
Because despite the huge costs, it can also be said that the joy that the Games bring is not of a nature that can be priced.
But although the exhibition is often grandiose and no expense is spared, it is of course not just about money.
It is the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some athletes, the postponement of the Games is a welcome surprise.
The Australian pentathlete and gold medalist in her event at the last Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, for example, is pregnant and would have been away from good fun this summer, but she is hoping to be in competitive form for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who is just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who intended to retire after this year's Games, if they had been held on time, the postponement of the Games in some cases means they will retire before the Games take place.
Trust their body simply not in order to go through extra years of rigorous exercises.
Few athletes have captured the hearts of spectators at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games like gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold medals and one bronze.
Biles has appeared in several interviews in her home country of the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to participate in the 2021 Games, but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top at the Games next year, because she will be 24 years old by then.
Although it is not generally considered high age, it is in the upper range for a gymnast of the first rank.
“It’s a sensitive issue,” said Biles, smiling in an interview published on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram page, when asked if she intends to reach as far at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
“I just don’t know if I’ll still be at the top after another year of training,” says Biles.
She has previously talked about her body not being able to withstand the strain of gymnastics much longer.
Nevertheless, she is training hard for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop practicing at the height of the pandemic and the gymnasium was closed.
No exceptions were made for Biles or anyone else while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access above the others, she had to find various ways to keep herself in shape like others.
The basic form certainly slightly better than most people.
“We have a tight schedule now.
It was hard to start practicing again after the gymnasium opened.
We started slowly but we are back on track and I will increase the training steadily as the year goes on.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we are still practicing for them, we can not do otherwise.
I’ve worked too hard to leave the sport now,” Biles said.
Like many others, she has her doubts, or rather her awareness of the possibility that the Games will not be held in 2021 either.
To predict that, however, is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021, and there is nothing else to do but to prepare for the Olympics given that they will be held next year.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid marches.
Postponed wedding due to pandemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about right now,” the actress told People.
“We definitely want to get married one day and have the wedding of our dreams with all the people who are dear to us.
But we decided to postpone it and focus on what is important right now, which is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I'm more interested in world affairs than weddings these days.
There’s a lot going on and we need to focus our attention on what’s happening in the world.”
