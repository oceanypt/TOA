The great return of the Czech loser is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň and Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He came on as a substitute exactly in the middle of the game against Vegas and hasn't played in the NHL since.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower body injury," the Denver Nuggets announced in early October.
His return to the goal in the NHL was eventually extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning U.S. time, he was called up from the farm, where he played four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he had 94.5% save percentage.
The Pilsen hockey graduate wants to finally prove himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last season, he had hip problems and did not play a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "Francik" played 36 games, his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles puts Camille on a mask on a Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
The British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also published his wish, using a photo in which he helps his wife Camille put on a mask at a race.
On its website, the British news station BBC reported.
They send greetings to friends, colleagues and the foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a T-shirt with a collar, just like Princes George and Louis.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, nor is it clear when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photo intended as a Christmas card on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country house in Norfolk.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the Crown Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask, which matches her light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminal investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former deputy chairman of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr was supposed to have a million crowns promised by Prague’s Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The server efotbal.cz reported that it got to a part of the police files.
The chairman of the Vršovice club Jaroslav Tvrdík said that the Red and Whites did not commit any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer, is the main figure.
According to the file, the former influential functionary of the Red and Whites was in frequent contact with both Berbr and the former sports director of the second-league Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the defendants in the case.
Criminal investigators allegedly worked with information that Slavia had promised Berbr a financial reward for winning the title.
2019 team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authorities knew that Roman (Berbr) had been promised a million-dollar bribe by SK Slavia Prague officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the criminal investigators, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file does not indicate whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, we have not sought to influence the referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this connection," said Tvrdík for Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former Slavia players of dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was unleashed in mid-October last year by a police raid at several locations, including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
The highest-ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz was released from custody, as was the former sports director of Vyšehrad.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold war.
Cannons will be new, but basically worse type (artillerists must from the armored cabin and carry cartridges by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - on a decent level, in addition, they have already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S and specialized units.
Aircraft: fighter - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I have a hunting ground next to the city.
Nutrias climbed from the river and did damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped he would leave before something climbed up, but of course after a while the fox went.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost sucked, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called him that it was a fox.
By the time I got out of the stall, he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a combination of a lot of coincidences to happen something, you would probably be seen in the thermal imager, which today has almost everyone.
So, in a conspicuous place, put your expensive stuff to your feet in a sleeping bag, and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Interior Ministry got respirators considerably cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of face coverings, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day, the amounts for respirators differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities have been economical?
And why did others buy more expensive?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks with iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I appreciate soldiers and the army (I guess I am not affected by the memories of the Czech Army, which suffered older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We do not even have large stocks of equipment that could be used for training, we do not actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, in addition, modern technology is becoming more and more complex, so the skills of reserves will rapidly lose in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where they can be deployed, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
Finally, reserve forces/territorial defense are of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerrilla warfare can be carried out and it is also an explicit necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will succeed only in a conflict of such scale and intensity that the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not have the appropriate geography for it.
mainly we don't have individual skill.
That's not the worst part.
The worst thing is that half of them play like they have it.
Then there are situations where you watch a guy who missed an empty goal 2 minutes ago, runs into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself "what do you think will happen now?".
Well, of course they'll pick him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "defending" is so terrible that I found myself being honestly surprised when I saw that our attacker was able to run around one player of the opponent.
The First Swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, however, experts do not expect a major turnaround in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the pressure in hospitals will last for some time and, as we know, a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omikron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently predominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired by previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon also entered the Covid equation this week on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new antiviral drug, molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic. It reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by one third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the results so far reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming medicines.
As mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients will be molnupiravir from Merck.
The company ended up on the tape first also because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for viral diseases of horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and don't openly share their opinions.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to saying "as our beak grew".
See, you do a research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you straight away that they don’t.
In the West, they tell you how they love migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing a job and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they do find out what people think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have over 20% according to the poll.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical.
Identical because of the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to re-learn where what is, so all objects are almost the same.
One is Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory either for reasons of security or speed of deployment of warheads due to its western location.
In those underground shelters (in each maple are two) were kept only warheads not the whole missiles as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some carrier device.
Apart from the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of primary school we had a classmate Gypsy, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he missed little, he went regularly, he did sports with us, he did not steal snacks or phones, he was cleanly dressed.
He also went to outdoor schools, did various monkey bars, but he was cool, maybe never a shit.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same year, another class.
Shortly after that, they beat the teacher, the police often solved something there, they threatened and threatened other students..
Personally, I sometimes sell something on an ad (old stuff, something I do not need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they did not try to try to pull me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called in a month that he had already transferred it to himself..
I say about myself that I am not a racist, I do not care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as he behaves as it belongs in a decent society (works, functions, does not beat women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, reaches out, empties apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, makes problems.. so it does not matter what color he has, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don’t care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs as well.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately, despite resuscitation care, she died of her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, spokeswoman for South Bohemian paramedics, told Pravda.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and, for unknown reasons, drove into the opposite direction in a bend.
After the collision with the Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on the roof off the road, described the South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
He suffered multiple injuries and remained trapped in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was transported by plane to the České Budějovice hospital, said paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered a slight chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He buys mainly collectible cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it still pays to import, especially from Japan, where the post is often free," says the collector.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly more expensive, he must now add VAT and provide the post office with data for customs procedure.
He receives an e-mail informing him that customs officials are awaiting the arrival of the package.
Then just fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT was not included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and for the transport.
If the consignee does not arrange the customs clearance himself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I check one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it’s usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of consignments received from abroad at the international post office in Prague fell from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests to provide data necessary to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 shipments on the international mail that we have to process.
If people filled in all the necessary information and did it on time, we would be about halfway there, says Matyáš Vitík, spokesman for the Czech Post.
Addressing inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and fuel in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable, where will it lead?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
They added 2% to my gross salary this year, which is ridiculous, but luckily I have a similar income from a business that I run alongside my job.
Would someone be able to explain to me why are proven convicted rapists sent behind bars for maybe only 6 months?
I just can't understand how a court can send such a beast behind bars for only 6 months only to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for several years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the victim of rape may never recover from it.
Will this not deter potential future rape victims from reporting?
A man from Hrob “burned” his girlfriend from Kostomlaty
A man from Hrob unwittingly helped the police to secure his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlaty, for whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He called them to him.
But he took a detour.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the guards arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he made up everything so that the guards would come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted advice from the police officers on how to file a complaint with the Police of the Czech Republic.
While checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers discovered that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore handled by PČR.
An honest question to the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that Slavs are not ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it's a shame that Churchill failed to ensure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something without any evidence just because it could potentially be beneficial.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
Here I can not agree with Pascal, there is an estimate in the world, if I am not mistaken, about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods should a person choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in some of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
After all, even in the Ten Commandments it says that there is no other god but Yahweh.
Wouldn’t it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk making the wrong choice among the thousands of gods and being sent to hell or somewhere else by the one real god I missed?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months on one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
Something like this would be useful for all branches of the Czech Armed Forces.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can say this: cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being talked about, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of intermingling, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to working relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process takes place constantly, each of us constantly learns something new, moves from one field to another, etc.
A similar blending should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that the Russian, German or Mongolian invader will never invade again.
​I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if anything goes wrong.
Well, please the master.
Just one election in the U.S. that crunch their budget and the whole NATO goes to shit.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas and the Poles have shown once that it is enough to turn their backs on them and they will take what they want.
The only thing that long-term works as a guarantor of independence is armed to the teeth army and the population who can control the military technology of their time.
And nowadays every teenager can pilot remotely controlled vehicles, so what could it not be.
We don't need border fortifications, that's a shit nowadays, but a smart teenager behind a remote control can handle it.
How not to drown in the box tsunami
You unpack the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home overwhelmed with boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes has been created.
And not only at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating shop (the project map KAMsNIM.cz contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, and also the money saved, as the price of packaging cardboard has risen by 50% over the past period.
In addition, I strengthen my brand in the eyes of ecologically minded customers.
One of these shops is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvky near Brno by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of abandoned cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine, if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to give up expired medicines, tires, used electronics, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All garbage can end up in the right place, and reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the map of the project already contains over 100,000 such places.
“Collection sites, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise become waste,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
It seems to me rather bad that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but they do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple’s photo apps, or mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the app.
Feel free to use the technique from childhood, but mainly to learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Before the weekend, Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they could not be carried out in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron’s supporters, divided between the right and the left, agree on few things, but they do on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar has also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create the conditions for such a work of historians.
Many commentators immediately rushed to criticize Macron for pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
Far-right French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is currently touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and he is having some success with the French.
Let’s take Macron’s idea of a single history textbook seriously, regardless of what’s happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a we-versus-them story, and never as a story of the whole.
Spanish, French, Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don’t have an enlightened preacher, they won’t know what the broader context of the event was.

Trains start to run according to the new timetable, some carriers will change
From Sunday, trains will start to run according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts operating instead of České dráhy.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, possibly slightly also their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
In the new timetable, České dráhy plans to run an average of 6,783 passenger trains per day, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic services, the new timetable will also include services to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Further new trains will be deployed in northern Moravia and western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year, on average by 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their fares every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry of the R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín line.
After winning the tender of the Ministry of Transport, the carrier will replace České dráhy.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 trains per day, eight in each direction.
Further changes concern the long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain as similar as possible the travel times of its long-distance trains despite the planned closure works.
Trains operated by Arriva and other carriers should continue to operate without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional routes.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will operate on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of the Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use a single rail fare for the second year.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by 3.2 percent inflation.
I must disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work and die.
In my life I have not heard the teachings from the slave party or from that time, nobody defends it, only condemns it.
Nobody even tells you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slave owners.
Nobody teaches you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they only tell you how brutally we, Europeans, exterminated them, while they murdered each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I haven’t encountered anyone deliberately concealing the facts, but I’ve heard before that it’s happening and I think it’s a problem, I don’t deny it (in Japan, for example, the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today’s point of view, without understanding.
History is not interested in one's feelings, it is just what it is, and I think it is a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, speaking of the southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave traders are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it nowadays.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was slaveholders and a lot of things they also disliked.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, plus maybe our view does not exist with them (on YT there was a video from television, where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that at some universities it was horrible, the students were quite radicalized and the schools often supported them in this.
And when I imagine that these people will one day be much older, I am a little sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because there is among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism, for example, has achieved what it had a long time ago and it is no longer the same, it has become radicalized.
Currently, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and it leads to radicalization on the opposite side, when it often leads to resentment even in quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
In any case, in conclusion, I have not encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered a bad geography, but it was mutual:D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If anything connects me with people, it is interests, world views and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak pastor is a very nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks some bullshit about the coronavirus, that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernism and are de facto Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to services with the Hussites, because theologically it is very similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael on the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they do mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The Flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not go to Vienna to pick it up this time either. In the morning, they picked it up from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing.
He was taken over at the border last year.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we participate with the division every year, I'm looking forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the journalists present.
While last year, the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly at the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, scouts travel by train to Vienna for him.
Nothing will change in the distribution of Flamingo in the Czech Republic.
Traditionally, the scouts took the Bethlehem light by train to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of the light on Saturday, December 18, traveling by selected express trains and passenger trains.
The light will be taken over by local scouts or volunteers at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic, even where the tracks do not lead.
Also this year, scouts must comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It is similar to last year.
We give recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear face masks, try to keep distances, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing colleagues, simply behave in such a way as to make it as safe as possible, described the spokesperson of the Bethlehem light event Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light travelling through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread together with the flame the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that conquers darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts have been spreading it for more than 30 years.
The event is supported by hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of altruism and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole are a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will use the money properly, but I do not understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - a useless product is produced and it undermines the free market and the “natural life of the company”.
I myself work in a factory where there are a million billboards in the corridors “x is financed/co-financed by project x” and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not a support of a company that gives work to x people, this is a hindrance of development when this company holds on and takes orders / employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
I totally agree, it's horrible.
Sometimes, even a person who was born in the Internet age, also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet advertisements do not move with me, but then I catch myself that they also influenced me - it's just so sophisticated that one can not always resist it.
For this reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all shit, in classic words - I would ban the Internet.
I have the feeling that this virus is rooted in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I will rather believe something that is less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion about which I will claim that it is critical thinking"
2. "I'm not going to believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have succumbed to the trend of Christmas movies, two hundred of them premiere this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have succumbed to the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will present a record number of more than two hundred of them to their spectators in premiere.
It was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years scores with the audience and significantly increases viewing, so these images are created more and more.
This year there were four times more Christmas films than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has only included those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will actually be many more holiday movies.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are especially associated with this period. Worldwide, films such as Home Alone, Heavenly Love or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular.
But the real boom of Christmas pictures started only in 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came up with a special film series, reminded the BBC server.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station started tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competitor Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on its lineup this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total.
"The story doesn't really matter in this magical season, the important thing is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," said Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
“For the audience, it’s a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and the madness of the world we’ve been living in for the last few years,” Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform, but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then about half an hour before the end some misunderstanding arises, which is successfully resolved and the two kiss.
This goes on and on, and as long as all the films look the same and have the same atmosphere, people watch one after the other, adds Gray.
Mazepin tested positive for Covid-19, will not participate in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for Covid-19 and will not participate in the final race of the season.
The Haas team will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to fight for a better finish than the 20th place he had achieved in qualifying.
Russian Nikita Mazepin of the Haas team will not participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, with Mazepin’s team-mate Mick Schumacher starting from the back of the grid, followed by Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to Haas, Mazepin is relatively well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved.
Haas will not send a replacement driver to the race, nor can it.
A substitute would have to participate in qualifying or races in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not dealing with covid-19.
At the start of the season just ending had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year were positively tested Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton.
You can get locked up for this, too.
And nobody cares what the boss said.
In terms of the law, covid is on the list of communicable diseases.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive sweater is amazing!
It is a bit like a portable jewelry store and the creator put in it half a year of work and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much at home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in six months.
He bought the silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2,000 decorative crystals supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness," praises the creator his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there's one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible," Liban admits.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater so far, sold five years ago, cost “only” CZK 720,000.

The government has approved sending up to 150 troops to aid Poland.
Engineers, scouts and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested the assistance of NATO countries in connection with the actions of the Belarusian regime, which has been inviting citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory for several months with the false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in southern Moravia?
Hygiene examines another case of a child from Adamov.
"Currently, we have reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov Elementary School has not been proven,” said Ciupek.
During the week, there were six cases in the region.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Institute of Health in Prague,” the director said.
She added that these are two nurses from one workplace of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four have no symptoms.
Nobody with a suspicion of Omikron traveled abroad
None of the mentioned persons travelled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor was there any contact with anyone who was staying abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship for any of the mentioned, said Ciupek.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová said earlier that the international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, is being investigated.
There were also players from South Africa and one Belgian player became ill after returning.
California will limit gun sales.
He wants to follow Texas in banning abortion.
On Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state, using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of an embryo’s heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to damages when suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsoma’s announcement came in response to Friday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld Texas’ abortion ban, although it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent ruling that established the right to abortion across the U.S. until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not decide on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual legal channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed Texas's ban on most abortion services to be maintained and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
“If states can now block federal court review of their laws, California will use that power to protect lives,” Newsom continued.
He allegedly instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the minister of justice on a measure that would entitle representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is the name given to home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to seek damages of at least $10,000 and legal costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault rifles, ghost weapon components, or kits in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," he said.
California has banned the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, the AP noted, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state now indeed renews the ban using the Texas template, the words of the liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion on Friday’s majority verdict warned against extending the legal mechanism to other American states, would be confirmed.
But the Supreme Court did not grant Texas’s abortion ban full immunity from judicial review, allowing abortion clinics to continue suing selected officials in the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, in which the vaccination scheme is gradually figured out and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
For example, from Israel, studies on the effects of 4 doses are already rolling in large numbers.
And according to these studies, in most patients there is a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination will eventually have its vaccination scheme, only it is too early for it.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer’s specifications promises up to 10 times greater effectiveness, should soon be on the market.

I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don’t want to change my TV and internet provider.
Poland threatens to stop payments to EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting against the law if it used its new powers and stopped paying money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland’s plan to draw €36 billion from the EU’s recovery fund for economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism that allows EU subsidies to be withdrawn from countries that violate the rule of law.
“Poland should respond to this EU blackmail with a veto on all matters requiring unanimity,” said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would have lost a narrow majority in the Sejm.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices,” added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified given that the EU illegally denies us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes made to the Polish judiciary under Ziobro threaten its independence and make it subordinate to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is setting “impossible conditions, because its aim is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland”.
Warsaw is facing “a political dictatorship carried out through blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on the rule of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never agree to concessions to Brussels that would limit Poland’s sovereignty.
“We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony,” he said.
But to get the hang of it... at Lidl they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I did not look for other things, I met one yogurt several times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less usual and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there’s a detour, I won’t even go to any market, no matter what’s happening, the gold store on the square, maybe they don’t have such a selection, but they usually have absolutely everything I need and it’s somewhat orderly, so I’m done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a holiday.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years I have been watching how data is treated like manure here, most anti-vaxxers are just a little more out of the box than most pro-vaxxers.

I was punished with a pot in my childhood.
It was never because of the grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (reading instead of going to sleep, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after another "tapping" of the pot she only brought it and laid it so that I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to obey that I got a few blows on the ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable way and degree) is beneficial, because the child responds to it much more than to words.
I think the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a choice whether to disobey and get it, or to improve and there will be no punishment.
In the end, only a warning was enough for me to start listening.
Defence of the system
In 1999, when a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojtěch Cepl, was asked by a journalist what the Czech Constitution meant to him – whether it was a sacred charter that he swore to and learned about at school from an early age, or, on the contrary, an agreement that could be changed if necessary, he decidedly inclined to the former conception.
Once we have agreed in a constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, it is better to save on changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, commented Vojtěch Cepl.
Recently, however, there is an increasingly common opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be amended.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to whom Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, such as the behaviour of a directly elected president.
On one point, however, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be deliberate.
The constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
A constitution is, among other things, an order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with prohibitions.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, at the FN Brno they fight for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been struggling with especially recently.
“We know that children are at risk and less affected than adults, we talk about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said Petr Dominik, Principal of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University.
The course is much easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are paediatric patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the recent period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at the clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently at ARU.
Children with post-COVID syndromes were on the ward continuously throughout the year according to the doctor.
“There is now an increase in children with acute COVID pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia that requires a stay on a resuscitation bed,” he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and babies a few months old in addition to adults.
There are also children in hospitals in serious condition due to the coronavirus.
"Currently, we have a child of several months and an adolescent," said the primary care physician.
However, he is happy that the Brno Children’s Hospital has not yet recorded any child deaths due to the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic as of 6 December.
According to Dominik, the psychologist is an integral part of the cooperation in the children’s hospital – not only in the coronavirus ward.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, vaccination also mitigates the course of the disease in children and simultaneously reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend the application of the vaccine dose in children," the doctor added.
In the quiet zone you can only walk on marked paths.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the enclosure).
Skiing / cycling in the forest outside the marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).
How does a conductor practice?
The music is playing in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
He was nurtured by the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer he can sing practically the entire repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the F. Šalda Theatre in Liberec, but also in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre in Pilsen.
He cooperates with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra and the Podkrkonošské Symphony Orchestra.
China builds the impression of contained contagion and that the authoritarian regime faces the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a controlled contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has launched a health-care and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing echoed criticism for failing to stop the outbreak, which has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero new cases.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is this friendly support, or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says: hey don't you want an elephant?
I got it and it's great.
His wife is happy because he eats grass, washes the car with his mouth, and the children play with him.
Well, just great.
If you want, I'll sell you an elephant for 5,000.
Friend: Yeah, we'll slap it, it's gonna be great...
After some time they meet and the one who bought complains: you dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
Lawn broken, shit everywhere, car broken, kids scared of him, wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold says: you are not talking nicely about the elephant, you can't sell an elephant like this...
World affairs are dominated by the superpowers.
Despite the equality of sovereign states, it is the superpowers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a superpower if it works on its own integration.
So far, this functions at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It will not be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the moods will be different and it will succeed.
I thought of it, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'm wordicking.
I'm just starting from the fact that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
Let me borrow an example from another comment “Spanish oranges and mandarins”, where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas in “Spanish fruit and mandarins” it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
In addition, I base it on the fact that the sentence reads “all American forces”, including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already covered by the broad concept and there is no need to specify it further for the US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just wordplaying:D
Either way, it's a nonsensical demand

Vicki Holland from the UK tortured the monkey Milly
The scary footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey curled up in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
A Gwent Magistrate's Court has now banned her from breeding animals for life, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehabilitation specialists who take care of Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a terrified monkey before.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with Monkey World staff in Dorset and is now happy to play with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The four-time mother pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison with a one-year probation by Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid labour, a lifetime ban on breeding animals and to pay 12,000 Czech crowns in court costs.
Small Monkeys team leader Steph Sawyer said: “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue.”
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will accompany her forever, adds Sawyer.
Milly’s abuse came to light after Gwent police discovered horrific footage on the woman’s phone after raiding her home on drug charges.
In the footage, you can hear Milly cursing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland is heard offering the monkey cocaine and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to possessing cocaine with intent to sell it.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was sentenced to 30 months in prison and Holland to 20 months suspended.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row by bravely skipping through the entire 20th century?
You mean you're gonna get the same stuff in first grade as you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of memorizing, where nobody, except for exceptions, cares if you know or understand it.
Mainly write the test to 1 and then nobody cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if they can determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the vast majority of them won't be bothered to tell you that they're totally in the shit.
So what the fuck is he studying for?
I am a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people do not want and do not need it.
And at that moment it is useless and you will never get it into them anyway.
It is partly learned for the many people who will need it.
But like, I meant it when I said you don't really need all that stuff to stand by the machine because you don't.
Moreover, we are slowly entering a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(What probably contributes to our communist past and persecution against educated people and elites) But the price of barbarians standing by the machines is simply high.
If, for example, journalists knew how to calculate, Covid probably would never have reached these proportions here.

The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
The latter, however, resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you!” Kadri was angered by Andrei’s accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri’s now ex-wife did not please even his younger sister Linda.
She decided to defend her brother publicly.
Normally, I don’t comment on such things at all, and even in the family, we never said these things to each other.
I definitely don't want to evoke any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and tarnish the name of someone I love so much, I just can't take it!
I am sorry that I have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for showing character and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
I am all the more sorry when I have to read such false information, which is probably taken out of context.
I would really like everyone to know Kadri like me, our loved ones and family, says in the confession in response to Andrey’s words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and we know the reality and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cchao started his robbery expedition in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than 330 CZK from one vehicle.
Then he could not think of anything better than to climb to the 5th floor and enter the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
One of the security camera footage shows him eating a banana as he walks away from the crime scene.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
The police subsequently detained Ccha.
The man admitted that he had drunk some alcohol on the incriminated day.
And since he needed money, in his drunkenness he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunkard climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is limited in time and its effectiveness is tied to the pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.

Isn't that reason enough for you?
The right of assembly will be restricted, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters came to vote in four municipal elections on Saturday
On Saturday, people voted for new councils in the villages of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Mostec region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the legally established number or the elected representatives dissolved.
On Saturday, 99 candidates competed for a total of 28 seats.
The average age of the newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69, the youngest is 33.
The processing of the results of Saturday’s elections symbolically closes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were a total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpová, Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding on equipment and personnel security.
The Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday’s elections in the town of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member municipal council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means a gain of two mandates.
Občané pro Komňu (Citizens for Komňa) also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of the vote.
The current mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of Soukromníci, was elected to the council again.
One seat was won by the Komňané – independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the association Pro Rovnou won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Lusatian and Svinčice Association, led by the mayor Jindřich John, won the repeated elections in Lusatian Most again.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The candidate list Obec pro lidi (Municipality for the People) finished second with 43.27 percent of the vote and will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region were won by the independent candidates of Naděje pro Novou Ves (Hope for Nová Ves) ahead of the ANO Movement.
The association of independent candidates won 59.88 percent of the vote and four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened compared to the regular elections in 2018, winning one more mandate and having three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the election results will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign policy?
I think you know all this that people are writing to you here.
You're just playing the fool to have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I’m not saying that Christians are degenerate or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes what.
On the other hand, I don’t like how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it hoarded, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, like the Thirty Years' War.
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell headfirst from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, where rescuers of the Regional Emergency Medical Service intervened.
An hour after midnight on Saturday, employees of the regional operation center received an emergency call with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two EMS crews – medical and medical – immediately went to the scene.
Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics found out that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and landed his head on the concrete!
Coal caught fire in Vítkovice.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures within the framework of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care of the Ostrava trauma center, informed the spokesman of the EMS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more afraid of the inadequate reactions of the public and authorities than of the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and healthcare personnel are on the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask the military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes defeated after seven years, Oliveira defended his belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
UFC 269: Conor McGregor vs. Khabib Nurmagomedov
Outsider Julianna Peňová was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who was undefeated for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in lightweight, showed a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored a victory, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also beat his opponent.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peňová.
The American entered the battle as a “dwarf”, as Nunes had not lost for seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her way to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
Peňová, however, did not let herself be forced to make any more mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack herself with a lever on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents showed a lot of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
Peňová also got Nunes on the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up and knock off the attack.
The American prepared a huge shock to everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier did better, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to defeat the opponent with a lever on the hand.
He did not succeed in that, but then he created a lot of pressure, got the opponent on his back and showered him with a number of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock the choke off.
The Brazilian thus defended the title, Poirier on the other hand lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a sovereign triumph, who already in the first round put on Raulian Paiva a hard right back.
Subsequently, he defeated him with a series of precisely aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to cope with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a young daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, this is nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, and therefore it is not difficult to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or intermediate.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns whose gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When they are declined, they then acquire double endings and in some cases they remain in the undeclined form.
For example, the words "svízel" or "kyčel" are both masculine and feminine, in the former they are declined according to the pattern "stroj", in the latter according to the pattern "píseň".
For another group of nouns, the different forms are already in the first case of the singular, for example: „řádek/řádka“, „kedluben/kedlubna“ or „brambor/brambora“ (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example “okurka” in Bohemia and “okurek” in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unscripted, similarly other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: “příkop” and “příkopa”, “kobliha” and “koblih” etc.
Some words that have penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally inflexible, but gradually take over Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remained in the middle gender, but in the masculine has endings according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation on the Greek border?
There are tensions on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people started to move to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians promise Greece support, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to embark on an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the ground?
We didn’t see blue skies for three months and we were suffocating, describes a journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires, which have plagued Australia for four months, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities and the inhabitants coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison’s government have done more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics argue?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks with journalist from Sydney, Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about absolutely everywhere.
It is uncomfortable for people to deal with how sexual violence looks like in our society and how terribly widespread it is, so they try to cover it up.
I do not personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who were raped and I have experienced how those people are often treated by their surroundings or even the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
It has become a trend that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But still too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there will be those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and a spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a lot of the allegations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping the rapists.
Czech Republic flooded with unfinished houses, families have no money to finish
Construction material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
This has put many people in a difficult situation.
She does not have the means to finish the houses under construction and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the cost of construction works is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to finish the already built houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move into houses that are under construction and not approved.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to repay mortgages and pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses a year, and this happens to fifty percent of them.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to comply with some things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we work without earning," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people will have financial problems.
If they were counting on the fact that the construction of the house will cost five million, now it will cost seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
Of the materials, copper, iron and plumbing and heating equipment decreased the most.
But construction companies are also struggling with labour shortages.
There is a shortage of construction graduates in the Czech Republic, and the pandemic is holding back the influx of foreign workers.
Only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favourable at the moment.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," said Křeček.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
Real vision is lacking, says CRO commentator – mujRozhlas
In addition to the classic celebrations, the entry into the new year was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message from President Miloš Zeman, the speakers of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
I have my own topic, which I chose, I follow up on my bachelor's thesis, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I write the written part.
State universities are completely calm in our country, if a person is not a total macaque and something remains in his head, then the commission will not unnecessarily choke him on theory.
For example, I studied for the state exams for a week and when I was in the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical deduction, which immediately hit me and I had it right.
Otherwise to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project (we did it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they are done.
I think it is great when at the end of the course there is an examination, which reflects the knowledge gained in the project, not just a defense.
All right, but don't overwhelm me with emails and phones, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same dick as them.
Those people at the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe put it so that it reaches Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws sticks under the feet of artists.
As soon as you do not post stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they keep changing which function is more important, like, comment or save.
It really sucks me lately, so maybe I’ll have to lower myself to tiktok, where a lot of artists from my industry are successful and don’t give it up.
Finally, I would perhaps like to see something more user-friendly, something that does not suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists.
Statement of the Workers’ Party of Donbass
Union – yes, disintegration – no, opponents of the disintegration of the USSR express their opinion on the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the openly condescending attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard to the people, signed an agreement that "the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one stroke of the pen, they “abolished” a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russians found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even without taking into account the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who, in one sitting in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha, destroyed what had been built up over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately deindustrialized, slowed down agriculture, and separated fourteen republics, which had previously been economically linked into a single mechanism, from the world's largest power.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, armies, the rise of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a "vacuum of power".
All that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries, which accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken, mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making dinner out of it on Thursday.
In the alternative reality, in which I do not buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain discounts it to 99 CZK / kg - describe the mechanism by which the meat becomes a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or will I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the expiration date - how would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday 120 CZK more expensive and left it for 3 days in my fridge?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This shit about that if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed bad, spoiled or poor quality are terrible retarded, to tell you the truth;-)
Recently I went in Brno to Hlavas and in the subway the ladies were giving out some brochure, I always take such things to help the temporary workers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I guessed it would be some sort of agitation.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was a good matroš, full of completely unnecessary precepts, like I should wash and not be a pičus.
Too bad for the paper, because of this, the forests would not have to be cut down.
I experienced something similar with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you like him or her without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
Several times she threatened me that she would hurt herself because I went out with a friend who she did not like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
About a year it was a great relationship but then passed another half a year and began to beat her on the stick.
Then I ended the relationship with the fact that I told her that I was breaking up and lied to her but that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and not to get some amok again.
Such a person sucks out your feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Better to keep a distance
When insurance companies are frantically robbing by buying a cloud of tests and chasing positives who would not even know about the terrible disease if not for the test.
The only thing we are achieving is complications for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator fell five days of house arrest.
In the West, they have stopped playing fools and recognized that there is no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing bullshit.
I see that the good old crap is back again.
After several years of suppression and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting again returns to the forefront.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises of training in products and business skills quickly turned into "it may not interest you, mainly get people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offer, because I wanted to help people, but the trainings were more about how to scare and persuade people.
When the first earned money came, you quickly realized that if you want to make money, you have to rush a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable, so then you felt like a door-to-door seller of pots.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, a person learned that he should not jump right on every speck and thoroughly verify the information.
At the same time, I would not throw them all in one bag.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly will not boast about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
In the corporation where I work, I have not experienced many such things.
HR is quiet, the managers look at their management and do not stick their noses into anything.
Regular evaluation happens somehow, in the form in which it takes place with us it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what worked and what did not) - it is more self-evaluation than that someone would evaluate you according to some numbers, and the like.
Corporate events also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you have the feeling that we are an almost-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation no.
But it works so we do not bother much until there are results.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police have been searching for a 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the resigning Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhánek announced on social networks that a woman from the Uherské Hradiště region was found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed this afternoon to our representative office in London that they found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With respect to the family, we will not communicate more information about the case.
My sincere condolences, said Kulhánek on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 in a bus on her way from work. Before boarding the bus, she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM.
Her colleagues reported her disappearance five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began to search for her, Interpol listed her among the missing around the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
But she did not disclose what role he played in the case and what she suspects him of.
At the end of the year, four municipalities had new councils
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Mostec region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the legally established number or the elected representatives dissolved.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates competed for 28 mandates.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the representative bodies in the four mentioned municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative positions.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of Saturday’s elections symbolically closes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We mostly had to work in more challenging epidemic conditions, which made greater demands on equipment and personnel security, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed on Sunday, 12 December at 03:49 a.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and after approval will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a dangerous infectious disease here, but it went without any major problems.
To come to terms with how idiotically a large part of the population on all its layers stands to it, I still have a problem with that.
I'm looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) the most because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not bullshit.
He would be stripped of his presidential office and of his eligibility to regain it.
The chance that this really happens is, however, as others mentioned here, very small.
Moreover, I'm not sure if the shredding of the file could be considered treason at all.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex all year is growing
More and more young adults in the U.S. live their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounced their sex life rose from eight to 21 percent.
More women between the ages of 18 and 35 say they haven’t had sex in the past year than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less a priority for young people, could also contribute.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among people in marriage, only 5% of them said in 2021 that they had not had sex in the past year.
Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage of the total number of marriages.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious beliefs also contribute to the decrease in sexual activity.
Although married people are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under the age of 35 is still falling.
Young people are divided on premarital sex, with about 30% saying it’s wrong and about 70% saying it’s okay.
“It’s true that they’re a minority among single people in this age group, but their behavior shifts the trend,” Stone says of those 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is a religious foundation.
Since 2008, among single people under the age of 35 who attend religious gatherings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20 to nearly 60 percent.
Among 'less religious', the trend rose from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that people without jobs or with lower incomes were less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby “compensating” for this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole COVID vaccination mandate is about whether society should force a part of the population to behave in a way that they don’t want, but that can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, in which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question whether if we do not order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old person who did not know much, we did not explain it well to him, he heard some disinformation, and as a result he did not get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are to blame for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who, alongside the SPD and the KSČ, talks about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter so far in the Czech Republic brought one of the smallest amounts of snow in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts cannot do without artificial snow, weather complicates even the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about the pancake maker.
Once in high school, our teacher took us across town to the shipyard so we could take a boat ride on the river.
On our way there, we walked along one of these quite wide streets and who do we not see in the middle - the followers of the Hare Kṛṣṇa sect.
Of course, they came down on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but they started talking with one of my friends.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she had said to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I have no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, were laughing all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
There’s not much going on, but the system is collapsing, says Orozovič
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki after previous visits to Paris and Brussels.
“We are opening a new chapter in our mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly make it clear that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the “Normandy Group”, which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because every night we record a hundred attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor, so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin will finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to the DPA, Scholz assured Warsaw of German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned Lukashenko’s regime’s inhumane treatment of refugees.
Drunk Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was driven by another nun, who was trying to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driving license for not giving way and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the car and asked her for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breathalyzer test and after finding out that she had more than two per cent in her blood, they immediately took away her driving license.
At the same time, they told her that she would confess her crimes in court.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
But Juraj Šajmovič did not take care of his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen themselves in American stories about dog pets.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film craft.
After the kitschy film by F. Brabce Gump - the dog who taught people how to live, another film Tady hlídáme my is now competing for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer and director Juraj Šajmovič ml. loosely builds on his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a pension in the Šumava, which is dying, and so they start inviting dog lovers, Julia's father and partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but an adolescent girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) struggled with narrative methods in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertaining there.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
Let’s summarize.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and when the right “constellation” arrives, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates just indicate – on the bonnet of a car or a church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the woods, who falls into a coma, after which the family takes her to the hospital, so that a miraculous process of healing by a dog can take place in the heart of the Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what a content melting pot full of unbelievable situations and figures was needed to convey this message.
A couple of thieves from the staff, a competition of dog owners, a charlatan from the Šumava Mountains, policemen arriving to search for “drugs” and discussing herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal – which the family drinks in the pension, of course.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and immediately sits curled up and makeup with a cigar at the family table and asks for his father's whisky and flaccidity as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the filmmaker explains to the viewer that “sometimes that happens after a coma”.
Šajmovič’s team lacks the basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to create supporting situations, a feeling for the characters and the point, and directing guidance.
The acting performances are unbalanced, the cut is helpless and the overall impression is sloppy.
No matter how hard Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their parties, they don’t have much to play.
The only positives of the film are the poetic shots of Šumava nature by the cameraman Vladimír Holomek and the pair of Dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a shabby plot and dog messages, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions that the characters commit.
Long-term membership in the Club of Dachshund Breeders - as in the case of the producer - is not an argument.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and the friendship between man and dog, there must also be a knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This has not happened in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy this amateurish piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant curses from idiots like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, and this shows how little you know about it, but that's just because you never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to that kid all the time, maybe you'd change your mind.
It is a job like any other, in this case a part-time job.
The Middle East has been plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
“The almost total absence of rainfall during November, as we recorded at some stations, is unusual,” confirms the Israeli Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of its long-term average rainfall for November.
The two-day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced the inhabitant of Nazareth Wasim Askar.
Precipitation in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, and is sporadic and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry up and are prone to fire.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Lake of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers warned about the drought long ago.
“It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall may decrease here,” Uri Schor, spokesperson for the Israeli Water Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
The streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, are filled with tanker trucks.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
“This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years,” said tanker driver Imád Sulejman in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military intervention against Iran
The Israeli defense minister said that the talks in Vienna had produced “no progress” and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is in the US, is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he has also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the Vienna nuclear talks had made “no progress” and the world powers “understand that the Iranians are playing with them.”
About 3 years ago this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a little and grilled while talking to find out what she really wants from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicion of the pyramid scheme was justified.
Since I really don't like these scams, I asked the lady a few more questions and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me a fool, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains on the weekend, they had enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced this weekend the first major influx of people interested in skiing.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operating.
The obligation to present a Covid certificate at the lifts did not discourage the skiers.
While lift operators do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people went to the cross-country tracks and ski slopes in the Liberec Region over the weekend.
The skiers were favored by the weather, which today offered sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really worked out from the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," praised the director of the Ještěd Sports Complex Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went for the first weekend skiing in the new season also to the Jeseniky Mountains.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region were open.
Weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today came an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are superb.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, a representative of the ski resort in Branná.
Operators of ski resorts can sell ski passes only to people who are vaccinated or are within the period after contracting the disease covid-19.
With few exceptions, people are prepared for this and provide the necessary documents, René Hroneš of the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told ČTK.
"We have recorded only units of incidents," he added.
Some ski equipment rentals and shops report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Luckily, there is interest in ski rental.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
He expects a greater demand during the ski courses.
The managing director of the Hradec Králové-based company Snowbear, David Šinták, also feels that due to Covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost out of loans.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the rental shop in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is in great demand.
They started renting skis a week ago and those interested must book them in advance.
"We will start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect great interest, as last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the area.
According to her, interest in the ski school is comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we do not want the successful and wealthy to go abroad, they must be able to live a life of the same quality as abroad.
This certainly does not include the socialist healthcare system, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people, who do not have any assets here, are leaving for abroad.
The owner of a company does not just leave abroad.
But I totally agree with the rest.
If these people will not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people will not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began when Orbán won one day, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is about elections at all.
If it's going to be a bad place to live, some traditional V4 freak might win.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose wealth cannot be stuffed into a plane will remain.
What a great photo!
Langmajer in blood because of a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film The Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), enjoyed the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social networks.
Is this a real injury, or is it a make-up for the shoot?
London police are still looking for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance does not match her behaviour at all and we are starting to be very concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor of Lambeth Police, where Srncová worked.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
The missing Czech woman, according to her, left work on Sunday, November 28, around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen in a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on 3 December by one of her colleagues.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant nurse" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
“We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” the group of healthcare facilities said in a tweet.
“We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harmanová, who drew attention to the Srncová case at a press conference on Saturday, also urges the public to cooperate.
“She’s been missing for a few days, she’s only 32, she’s from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried to death,” the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by London police.
“I feel that we all have a special responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our healthcare,” Harman said.
Police earlier arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
This is not how I underestimate Ukraine.
These are not "huge numbers", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of the Invasion and is getting tired of our entry.
I quoted above.
I don’t know how he came to the conclusion that Russia wanted war.
War is fucking expensive fun, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 1938 is wrong in so many respects that I don’t even know where to start.
That I can compare with the first Punic War and "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine has announced that it does not intend to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That is all, and that is what the "concentration" on the borders would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections
Passengers in Prague’s integrated transport (PID) are awaiting several changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed their routes, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
The region of Mladá Boleslav is now part of the integrated system.
Since Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station in the capital.
In suburban train traffic, S7 trains will depart, which on the route from Beroun to Cesky Brod pass through Prague Main Station.
The newly opened Prague-Zahradní Město station will be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will now be expanded to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be incorporated, including lines extending to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced and 12 existing ones will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will run from Prague Zličín to Žatec.
There is also a new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and on weekends, when the new express line number 404 will run.
Lines 400 and 410 travelling to the Liberec Region are now included in the PID system.
They depart from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The backbone line 400 runs via Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The supplementary line 410 runs via Melnik and Duba to Doksy, Mimon and Jablonne v Podjestedi.
On the other hand, the service on ten Central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, has been cancelled or limited.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice region in the Pilsen region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option where to get food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, I have no strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as much as possible healthy and diet.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy maximum pizza buns and yogurt and apple for snack.
Question: what healthy food without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it’s not about the trees that you have to see.
Only the top of the tree can be hidden under the snow.
If pony, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that this is the only reason why we are forbidden to ski off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dary's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has lived with nothing else than the revelation of the relationship between Dary Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to her fans, in which she explains why she hid the love from them for six months.
"I would say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would not know that Dara hunted a bear, sorry, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer to her ears.
But he said he packed her, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they do not enjoy it.
And here it is.
What we were both not looking forward to, but we knew that one day it would happen, continues the singer.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who do not care at all and it jumps on them even from a can, or we, whose lives are dissected in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend fit together enough, or you insisted that everyone knows in detail the list of your former partners and are familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's a joke, that's what you want, Darja is upset.
The couple met in Italy, where Rolins was preparing her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd, on the other hand, has long served as vice-president of the football club Juventus.
They didn't tell the truth until now, because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but on paper they haven’t been together for three weeks.
In any case, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us this.
We too are just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right places.
That’s why I love my new man and just as he stands by me, I stand by him, for good and for bad,” Rolins concluded.
Hi, I think the other commenters have already said all the essentials, I just confirm that dormitories are great for the beginning, my fellow students usually get to know each other and become friends during the first semester or two and then find sublets together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments are usually not advertised too long in advance, so you probably won’t find much right now, but it certainly doesn’t hurt to take a look at the offer.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surroundings (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that is quite a bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a little ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří neighborhood is very student, Královo pole and in that direction it is fine, besides that it is close to most of the faculties of BUT (I do not know where exactly you are entering).
I have never looked for a rent, but I am a native Brňák, so I can possibly advise you with Brno as such, if you still lack some information:)
But this is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually perfectly fine that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it from their own or let them go according to the state and the state will pay for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution and thanks to that he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some of its weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier said this about a petition campaign for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So to you, voting against someone having an abortion is the same as voting against a statue standing in a square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who assigned you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitization that (even long-term professionals) either throw it off the eye, or write something like xxx *** or... (according to convention) and in the note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite legible, so I would probably not recommend it completely.
Personally, I would probably deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a decent and hard-working student, you can look into some character databases and find the one closest to you.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess the author or printer simply created his own symbol that fits what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it by chance more Odryská říše (království) than OdryNská?
PSS: someone already solved it for you here.
Check out this comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the 'theme' of our presidency will be.
That is a much worse mess than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because nobody understood a text is ridiculous.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, for that a basic knowledge of English is not enough, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing extraordinary relationships.
Moreover, with the English it is quite interesting, after the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and I'm totally fine.
How many times I drive from work I at 10 pm and never no problem.
That it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly ever walked there in his life.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is to get in the way on the sidewalk and park where they don't have to :D It's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb out on the street in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go for it.
Lots of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and his mistress Gelemová like a stick in a fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dáda's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist to Blesk, thus confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently we met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together Again!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so it wasn't Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy something for Dáda and Lucie, probably a perfume.
I am a gentleman, added Felix, who came to the music video christening in the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet Luděk Sobota’s wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland to be able to afford not to have troops and weapons?
I doubt that someone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, explain that to me?
I do not know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals during a crisis.
There are few police officers and they can not afford it, so only firefighters and nowhere else is such a high percentage of medically trained people on such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend only Ostrava goes to the head of the previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountainous and sub-mountain areas, and even places where there was no shortage of moisture have recorded less rainfall.
Climate change is the cause of the drought that is affecting a large part of Central Europe.
But the impacts are also exacerbated by the way we manage soil.
What to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah it will be like that, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I know what it's like to play hockey and the tactics (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total fool.
And whether you are a hockey team "bear Russia" or "lama China" so losing by two goals, even if you do not have to win the match at all costs is different than when it is equalized.
But anyway, what I listen to the Czech commentators, what they point out, what the referees notice do not notice whether male or female hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it was the other way around so it is as always, and that the Czech Republic with Russia more often lost than won, probably it would be the classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The number of confirmed cases for the last 14 days in the Czech Republic is 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 for the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections were registered.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered cases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the UK Health Safety Authority, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron have already been hospitalised in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omikron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister in Johnson’s government defended that the quiz took place “virtually,” via a computer.
But it was attended in Downing Street by groups of employees gathered around computers.
There is growing pressure in Britain to remove Johnson as prime minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson’s ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of the commercial television ITV for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won an overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events developed.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections this spring that could end Viktor Orbán’s 12-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European importance.
How much can they be expected to be fair?
They will not be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán were not free either.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes electoral boundaries to profit, and does other tricks, large and small.
The last one so far is that in practice everyone can vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to lure voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
In the past, the question was not whether Fidesz would win, but how much, and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they not play even harder in order to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, independent media leaked a recording of László Kövér, the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, explaining to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yeah, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my parents, my mother has not much patience, neither do I, my father has it for a long time, but then he beats extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I was very angry as a child, to the extent that I lay on the ground in a convulsion and was all blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm me down.
Sometimes they slapped me, sometimes it was more that they did not know.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things by force, as a child I was quite fighting, now I at least slam into something to vent and as a younger I would slap my parents over the hand (so that I would not get too much over the cunt), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is my explosiveness, but certainly the upbringing also has its share.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn’t have done it, especially not at that moment when it wasn’t “educational” anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws up something, it’s probably impossible not to mess up their children at least a little bit, so I don’t blame them.
It does not offend me, I do not understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So those who make laws in that quality, I would call them kundas.
Otherwise, I wonder if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have something from which to pay the mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of journalist Kuciak's murderers?
In Slovakia, the main hearing in the trial of the four defendants accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How fundamental a turning point will the trial mean for Slovakia?
Journalists are hugely to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which was published a day or two later?
No, they let themselves be fooled and society jumped over it.
On Czech television, people were dying with COVID-19 six months ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš has come to an end, and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of deep-sea storage of highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Repository, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments expect the law to significantly strengthen their options when deciding on the storage site, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The municipalities criticize the draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, in particular: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a site for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given locality.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to obtain the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating a specific procedure.
The submitted draft of the substantive intention almost completely neglects the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for storage, its authorization and operation.
According to today's legal norms, representatives of municipalities do not have many possibilities to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a site for storage.
They may submit comments or appeal only in certain permit procedures, but the decision is made by the authority or the minister in whose interest the permit is to be issued.
Any action has no suspensive effect on the execution of exploration or construction works.
The co-decision of local authorities, which the Platform calls for, is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those where they have already made progress in permitting the storage site, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, moreover, another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek location and spokesman of the Platform against Deep Repository said: After the ministers of industry, who only postponed the equalization of the position of local authorities vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep repository of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We are also grateful for the support of the Association of Towns and Municipalities, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental construction similarly to the directly affected municipalities in the selected localities.
The Platform against Deep Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited only to deep repository.
Furthermore, the Platform advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible storage should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced to lose weight fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, the doctors finally scared him.
They told him that if he did not die, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new body in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was making furniture crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," he said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still," Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC News.
It also depends on what kind of boss and where you want to use the word "boss".
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from the game environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, perhaps a university text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
In addition, there are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, yes, and so the "boss" is something like the master / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super bosses, hidden bosses) that are not required to be defeated to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard bosses.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where bosses are, but the player does not face them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
Well, then there are mini bosses.
It is probably not possible to translate boss in one word, Czech and other languages do not solve it (interesting is only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final adversary).
In short, it is a computer-controlled opponent stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of a level or task.
The whole world is looking for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police were also involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
Police have been looking for the 32-year-old woman since 7 December.
Through Interpol, he also helps the British police.
The Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
The British police have been looking for her since 3 December.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular for her.
The whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police cooperate closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
"We're sharing information on the case," she said.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, is skinny and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradišt'sko.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman, a local MP, also joined the search for Petra.
She participated in hanging flyers with the face of Petra.
"We are extremely concerned about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
But it is not clear who he is and what he had to do with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, attacks increased significantly last month as the end of the year approached.
A major campaign related to Agent Tesla was recorded on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers’ strategy remains the same.
The infected email attachment is designed to attract the user’s attention with a title that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the malicious attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was labeled as Kopie opravky účtenky za 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored credentials and sends them to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the holidays and the end of the year approaching, the activity of attackers is growing again.
Formbook spyware also remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists caught campaigns with a global reach in November.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it still accounts for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with an.exe extension, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name receipt continues to appear.
An attachment in Czech can be far more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts recorded a significant decline in Fareit activity, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
Today's demonstration of smart people who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The parade through Prague was larger than the media reports.
According to the footage of the procession along the embankment and my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of an estimate of around 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the embankment, the bridge and the opposite embankment.
This is means that people really a lot.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously joined the procession of about 4,000 demonstrators.
I claim that something new is born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to the fact that they found a common language.
Only the anti-vaccine, anti-mask and co. would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events of the Chcípl pes association are becoming increasingly popular, reminding me of the Million Moments for Democracy Inside Out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say which movement could be bribed from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not become four or more doses.
It will definitely not be a left-wing or centrist movement, bet on that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines have saved us.
A brilliant action of scientists, of which humanity is rightly proud.
The end of a stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has entrusted the formation of a new government to Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement Continuing Change, which won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has lasted since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
But the winning parties, which proclaimed a fight against bribery and abuse of power, could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
The “secret” footage is a global hit.
A 32-year-old Czech woman has been missing in London for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her former employer and the MP representing the part of London where she lived are calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petra's disappearance does not match her behaviour at all and we are starting to be very concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor of Lambeth Police, where Srncová worked.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
The missing Czech woman, according to her, left work on Sunday, November 28, around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen in a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on 3 December by one of her colleagues.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant nurse" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
“We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” the group of healthcare facilities said in a tweet.
“We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children’s rooms from Šumperk (and also a regional pirate councillor), was accused by an anonymous person of infringing copyrights with her paintings.
The court, however, recognized that the Krtek paintings in Šumperk’s dormitories did not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch burned for a month.
It was life.
The Magistrate referred complaints to the ŘSD, which owns the road, and because it did not react, the hole continued to grow.
In the end, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the ŘSD began to “solve the situation intensively”.
