At the Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference, students play the leading role, with research results that are thought-provoking - Xinhua Net
Using air to wash hands, judging diseases by breath, accurately locating the sources of smog – Last night, at the opening ceremony of the Zhejiang University 2016 Academic Annual Conference, a series of imaginative academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical, life sciences, and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biosensor: Your Family Health Doctor
The team of doctoral students from the College of Biomedical Engineering, led by Zhang Diming, demonstrated an on-site biosensor for smartphones that is only half the size of a smartphone.
You just need to gently exhale, and this device can preliminarily detect your health condition from the components of your breath.
Zhang Diming explained that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Market-available smart wristbands capable of monitoring health status typically measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor system utilizes graphene, a novel material, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the body's health status more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent surgical lights: The high-energy eyes of doctors
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are now also being used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver prize at the 44th Geneva International Invention Fair in Switzerland this year.
Masters students from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei's team, have pioneered a new approach by addressing the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights, inventing an intelligent LED shadowless operating lamp.
Many diseases are not detected early or not completely excised, which is related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room.
Shen Junfei says that, for instance, during early-stage cancer screenings, if doctors cannot clearly see all tumor tissues in time, then the cancer cells will continue to spread afterward.
This intelligent surgical light features four lamp panels that enhance the contrast of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical process, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate at any time according to surgical needs and personal preferences.
This intelligent surgical light has already been tested in hospitals such as the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water and, at most, use some soap or a little hand sanitizer, but Li Qizhang and his classmates have invented a set of "air hand washing devices."
Once we stand on the washbasin of the device, our weight can compress the air out.
Just like an air pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
This way, we can wash our hands clean!
The color change reaction and bacterial residue tests prove that the effectiveness of hand washing by this method is the same as that of the ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, ensuring cleanliness while saving 90% of water. The entire process is completely energy-free, making it energy-efficient and eco-friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.

A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the skill certificates that I find important, in addition to my driver's license!
Spread the word: First aid measures are actually emergency responses to sudden incidents, which are the lifesaving actions taken before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident occurs, and it is precisely this time that is most critical.
This is the time when emergency aid is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a cerebral hemorrhage, or a sudden respiratory arrest, then the window of life we have is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it's so important that people around you know first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them, instead of standing there foolishly, motionless, unable to do anything. That feeling of helplessness is just too terrifying.
In China, according to our official data, there are three million accidental deaths every year, with the most dangerous being sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved.
In the casinos and hotels of Las Vegas, seventy to eighty percent can be turned around, [but in] Shanghai and Beijing, less than 1%.
This was said by Lu Le, the founder of First Response.
If a person has a sudden cardiac arrest, and there is no breathing, no heartbeat, pinching the philtrum (or "Ren Zhong" acupuncture point) is of no use.
Artificial respiration and external chest compressions must be performed to potentially save a person's life.
I've noticed that currently, very few people are aware of the importance of learning first aid. However, when an emergency occurs, it's too late to learn. Therefore, I appeal to everyone to acquire this skill so that we can respond promptly in unexpected situations.
Who knows, it might even save a person's life!
You can sign up for a first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Zhuhai Red Cross training center, and there are discounts for students as well.
PS: The last picture shows the list of goals I aim to accomplish before turning 25, and adding the first-aid certificate to my list of goals was something I decided on a few months ago, but indeed, I have achieved it!
Next, I plan to take exams for other certifications that I'm interested in. I'm thinking of getting a diving certificate. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there's also a diving first aid certificate, but it seems that you need to have a first aid certificate before you can take that one, so actually, a first aid certificate is quite useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#
A shrimp dumpling costs 13 yuan for just one?!
I haven't tried it.
Why doesn't #NAME# make it clear?
One costs 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed the meal delivery, and this time you just gave me a shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it previously.
Conclusion first, I personally think "The Four Seas" is a terrible movie in every sense of the word.
But if you say this movie doesn't have any highlights, that's not entirely true—at least the soundtrack selection is pretty good.
There are many types of bad movies, one kind puts you to sleep in the cinema, and another kind leaves you righteously indignant after watching it. "Four Seas" to the audience is like the monkeys on Mount Emei, capable of igniting your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is truly gifted when it comes to insulting the audience.
This film's most agonizing aspect is that it seems like a creation from a Ke-style novel, indescribable and as full of holes as the trench coat worn by Little Marco.
After watching it, you might wonder if there is a metaphor intended by the director hidden within, but upon careful consideration, you realize it's actually just a pile of crap.
Let me briefly talk about some plots that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, depending solely on his grandmother for support.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to take her to the Northeast in a minivan to see the snow.
Elderly people of advanced age take a minivan from the south to the northeast to see snow??
He and his dad are still very confident about it.
And then there was no more information about this elderly person.
How did her brother manage to get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the ruffian racing gang on the island easily block off a section of the mountain road?
Then the truck delivering rebar stopped in the middle of the road, and even the truck driver couldn't be found anywhere around.
The prop feels too obvious.
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a poor credit record and suspicion of illegal activities become an auxiliary policeman?
Facing high-interest loans, why not call the police? In the movie, the police even specifically asked if there were any difficulties.
An adult knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open a hotel door, then insists on not finding the hotel owner and sleeps outside the room door for a night?
These inexplicable plots pervade the entire film, and recalling them is so painfully absurd that it causes me distress.
Beyond the plot, what's worse is the film's theme, or rather the lack of any theme at all—it's just an abhorrent Frankenstein's monster.
At the beginning of the movie, you would think he wants to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guess it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through, you feel it may be a drama about the hard life of young people in a small town. After finishing it, you have no idea what you just watched, which is followed by a deep self-doubt, wondering why you went to the cinema during the festive season to watch crap.
Most people are actually very familiar with the tropes of various kinds of movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, you use a mix of inspiration and comedy to show the audience how a talented rookie progresses step by step towards success.
If you want to make a romance film, then honestly depict the complicated love and resentment between a small-town youth who loves riding motorcycles and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least, the plot cannot contain elements that contradict the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle played by Yin Zheng was just burned, and then he could still sing), you can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand.
Regarding the fact that the female protagonist clearly isn't mentally disabled but behaves like a 5-year-old child in some aspects, I really don't know if this is due to the acting or the director's demands.
One thing I also quite don't understand is why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen on including car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this movie scheduled for the Spring Festival slot to annoy the audience?

Concrete manhole module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a domestic professional manufacturer of concrete inspection well module brick machines, inspection well block machinery, and well wall module machinery, ranging from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
After years of practice and development, we now have high-quality products, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile, fully automated inspection well series equipment and supporting devices.
Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment, Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Concrete Manhole Module Production and Processing Equipment, Characteristics and Advantages of Zhengzhou Well Wall Brick Module Equipment:
The Yixin manhole inspection well block brick machine equipment is widely applicable to new types of masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, gas, etc.
For example: Various inspection wells, rainwater inlets, square channels, septic tanks, and small structures such as bridge wing walls for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to construct inspection wells lies in the fact that the modules are structured with grooves on all four sides—top, bottom, left, and right—allowing for an interlocking chain-like assembly when combined.
Well wall masonry has far superior shear resistance compared to the plain friction masonry form.
The modules are hollow structures, and after being assembled and built, the vertical holes are interconnected, and the horizontal holes are penetrating. After the cores are poured, a cast-in-place concrete network structure is formed, which plays a role in secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
Modules are equipped with tendon slots both longitudinally and transversely, with transverse lying tendons and longitudinal inserting tendons correspondingly enhancing the overall structural strength.
Additionally, the use of concrete inspection well modules for the construction of inspection wells and drainage wells prevents issues such as collapse, subsidence, and leakage. The wall modules of the well have stable mechanical properties, are simple to operate, and have standard molding dimensions.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with intelligent control with data input and output devices. It features a one-touch touchscreen LCD display to monitor the entire mechanical operation process, achieving an ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis and proportioning of materials, density operation, safe logic control, and a fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic transmission and dual-cylinder hydraulic transmission.
Independent hydraulic integration station avoids the impact of the host vibration on the hydraulic system, thereby ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system's operation.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment feeding box moves forward, the mold box demolds and rises, the storage bin door closes, the automatic transportation of pallets, all independently completed by the hydraulic system, thus achieving the reduction of mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical components, sealing and hydraulic parts, ensuring the equipment's comprehensive performance is stable and reliable.
Well wall module mechanical excitation platform adopts integral plate steel, the platform surface is wire-cut and molded without welding points, allowing the packing box to swing freely for guidance, which greatly reduces mechanical wear.
Reduce the mold load, fill and combine two-in-one densification amplitude, adopt integrated and full synchronization, platform vibration, and mold vibration, to ensure the achievement of compaction effects.
Well wall module mechanical exciter, with computer automatic control of amplitude, adjusts the amplitude according to the cost-performance ratio of raw materials, features no wear braking, thereby extending the service life and reducing costs.
Well wall module has both automatic and manual control functions.

Chongqing vocational school pilots modern apprenticeship program - students are prospective company employees upon enrollment - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students participating in the pilot program will have the status of an apprentice, and after enrollment, they will be pre-recruited as employees by the pilot companies.
The Municipal Education Commission requires the standardization of enrollment and admission procedures for secondary vocational schools and company hiring processes. It clarifies that apprentices who are students in secondary vocational schools have a dual identity as potential employees of companies. Agreements must be signed by the apprentice, the school, and the company based on the principle of mutual selection. For apprentices between the ages of 16 and 18, agreements must be signed by the apprentice, the guardian, the school, and the company to confirm the rights and interests of each party, as well as specific details about the apprentice’s on-the-job training, including their job position, instructional content, and rights protection.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship systems and cooperate with businesses to jointly conduct pre-job training and retraining for enterprise employees.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises co-design talent cultivation programs, jointly develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job position standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot spans one educational cycle, with the duration of students' internships in companies determined by the professional talent training program, typically lasting 6 months for intern positions.
In corporate practice, the enterprise team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different specialties, one master can take 2 to 5 apprentices, forming study groups to ensure that the students master the skills required for each rotation position proficiently.
According to the plan, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has identified 60 municipal-level secondary vocational modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches, with each pilot having about 50 participants, training a total of approximately 3000 students (apprentices).
In accordance with the principle of starting with pilot programs and then gradually expanding from individual points to the whole area, we explore the establishment of long-term mechanisms for joint enrollment and training by schools and enterprises and integrated education to effectively enhance students' job skills and to improve the rate and quality of employment that matches students' fields of study.

I've considered this vacuum cleaner for a long time and finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase it. The vacuuming effect is pretty good—there's obviously much less dust in the house. It is a bit heavy to hold with one hand though; the wet mopping feature could be improved, as going back and forth leaves dust trails. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with it.
The food processor is quite heavy, it looks upscale and is suitable for kitchen novices like me. My child says the food it makes tastes better than what I fry myself. I've cooked two meat and two vegetable dishes with it, with the sweet and sour spare ribs being particularly delicious. It takes a bit more time, but for other dishes, it's very quick. The noise is minimal, so there's no need to worry about food getting burnt, and no more worries about not knowing how to cook!
After receiving the goods, I couldn't wait to stir-fry three dishes at noon. Technology really changes life, with precise control of the heat and seasoning. The taste of the dishes has been directly upgraded to a professional chef level. Not bad at all, it's a miracle tool for those who are not good at cooking. Highly recommend purchasing!
I have added a new member to the kitchen.
Intelligent cooking machine, the kind that automatically adjusts the heat and stirs the food on its own.
No longer need to fear getting scalded by hot oil, nor need to worry about failing to control the heat properly, causing the dish to be overcooked or undercooked.
The stir-fried dishes turned out much tastier than the ones I make. The scrambled eggs with tomatoes were particularly flavorful, and the eggs had a really good texture.
This pot is a good value for the money.
The item is good, worth buying, very good.
Overall very good, very clear, consistent with the description.
Deserves to have.
The customer service is also very good.
The screen is large and clear, doesn't tire the eyes, and no other abnormalities have been found for the time being.

South African Doctor: Omicron is highly transmissible but mostly causes mild cases
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a medical organization in Gauteng Province consisting of over five thousand doctors reported that the symptoms presented by their COVID-19 patients are currently mild and similar to those of the flu, such as body aches and coughs.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none have needed hospitalization so far.
Pei Lei said: "They were able to control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said, this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are inherently more susceptible to serious conditions due to coronavirus infections.
He said that, compared to this, the COVID-19 patients he treated during the previous Delta outbreak had "difficulty breathing, low blood oxygen levels."
"Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
After the Omicron variant was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences within two weeks.
Although it will take several weeks to collect sufficient data, the doctors' observations and early evidence have offered some clues.
According to the summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa: among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% have severe symptoms, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, compared to a death rate of 20% among cases from the early outbreak in South Africa.
The director of the Africa Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all indicators suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "It is still early, we need to obtain later-stage data."
Under normal circumstances, hospitalization and death occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks.
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are monitoring case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite Delta still being the dominant COVID-19 variant worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in Gauteng province during the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that over 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.
Thank you to today's supporters; all 80 boxes have been given away!

### Education Commentary: What Does It Take to Save Abducted Children?
If we draw an analogy from the famous public service slogan "No trade, no killing," then, in a healthy environment without the demand for "buying abducted people," with community defense and treatment and nationwide opposition to abduction, making the act of trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the child missing information emergency release platform developed by the Anti-Kidnapping Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an internet information platform established for creating an authoritative channel for disseminating information on missing children and for the timely recovery of abducted children.
Having heard that this app is called "Reunion," I immediately felt a surge of warmth.
New technological methods are not only poetically named and full of sentiment, but also properly applied in information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-human trafficking enforcement is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Secondly comes the trial and punishment of the suspect.
Criminal punishment's significance ranges from individual retribution, social prevention to legal education, and many "grand terms" can be listed.
Before the human trafficking case is cracked, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Things have their priorities. Under the pressing goal of "search and rescue," controversial topics, such as "Should child trafficking be punished by death in all cases," can be set aside for the time being to be discussed cautiously; however, the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
Based on experience in investigating such cases, human traffickers tend to quickly move away from the crime scene after succeeding in their crime.
Every minute that the search for abducted children is delayed, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case increases accordingly.
In this situation, presenting practical solutions like the "Reunion" platform that directly aids in solving cases and finding lost children is indeed a pragmatic action.
After all, "combating human trafficking" is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to be done well.
Combatting crime and safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents require thorough implementation of care and support for the young and the weak, from the perfection of legislation to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulousness of law enforcement.
Additionally, there is room for improvement in the prevention of child trafficking, from the family level to society at large.
For instance, a common scenario: a family of three is resting at the train station, with the parents fast asleep, only to wake up and discover that their child has gone missing.
You cannot expect a two-year-old child to possess adequate self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a considerable level of protective awareness.
Parents taking turns to rest, or placing their child under secure protection, are the most basic measures to prevent child abduction.
From another perspective of the police crackdown on human trafficking, the party purchasing trafficked children should also be focused on and penalized.
A single unlawful act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of our country's Criminal Law, the statutory sentence for the crime of child trafficking starts at 5 years; in particularly severe cases, it can be punished with the death penalty and confiscation of property.
With a high starting point for sentencing and a severe maximum penalty, the crime of child trafficking obviously falls under the category of offenses with heavier punishments in the context of the overall trend towards lighter sentences.
However, to this day, there are still many cases of human trafficking occurring every year.
It is evident that some people have outdated views on parenting and a weak sense of law.
Legal education for this group of people should be carried out in step with other measures.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, relying solely on strict law enforcement by officials is not enough.
If a widespread market for kidnapping persists, with traffickers driven by greed constantly innovating their methods of abduction, creating a contest of wits with law enforcement, the efforts to combat kidnapping are bound to fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, dispelling outdated notions and popularizing legal knowledge can also help eradicate the crimes of trafficking and purchasing children.
Yang Haodong gave a lecture on the spirit of the 19th CPC Central Committee's Sixth Plenary Session and the Provincial Party Congress at Malanshan.
Draw strength from the Hundred-Year Struggle of the Party to forge ahead.
Hunan Daily, December 10th – (All-Media Reporter Gong Baiwei) According to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Committee, on the morning of December 10th, Yang Haodong, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department, conducted an interactive briefing at the Malanshan Video and Cultural Creative Park. The event was focused on a profound study and implementation of the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Party, studying and implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and major instructions concerning Hunan, as well as learning and implementing the spirit of the twelfth party congress of the province.
Yang Haodong explained the spirit of the plenary session's core essence and practical requirements in a profound yet simple, comprehensive, and systematic way, combining his own insights and personal experiences from three aspects: ideal beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and the party of youth, and the party's leaders and party theory.
He pointed out that we must combine the spirit of the plenary session with the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and important instructions on Hunan, and the spirit of the provincial party congress, to learn them in an integrated and thorough manner. We need to enhance our ideological, political, and action awareness in staunchly upholding the "Two Establishes" and achieving the "Two Upholds," and to resolutely move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive communication session, grassroots cadre representatives, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the "two establishes", how cultural enterprises can grasp guidance, and how the youth of the new era can draw strength from the centennial history of the party. Yang Haodong answered each question in simple language and with vivid examples. He earnestly entrusted young party members to draw progressive power from the hundred-year struggle of the party, to unite closely around the Party Central Committee, to follow the Party unwaveringly, and to dedicate their youth to writing responsibility and undertakings.

Actually, I don't know if it was the shop's mistake or the rider's mistake.
There are no documents on the bag.
Unable to trace
I hope you all understand a bit
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than displayed.
No more, thank you.
Yes, a new rider has already been switched out.
He has already waited for a long time.
That restaurant has always been saying that it's in the process of being dealt with.

The International Olive Oil Council classifies olive oil into two main categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil (also known as Lampante Olive Oil), further divided into five grades.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as pure olive oil, is a fat obtained by mechanically cold pressing and various processes such as filtration to remove impurities from fresh olive fruits.
Acidity can be classified into three levels based on differences in acidity.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, a pure natural product.
Flavor is exquisite, with a delicate and pleasant botanical aroma, and acidity not exceeding 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and aromatic taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, with acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained by refining virgin olive oil with acidity exceeding 3.3%, or it becomes "secondary oil."
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Regular Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of extra virgin olive oil to balance the flavor and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, presenting a clear light golden yellow.
Refined olive-pomace oil is olive oil obtained by extracting from the pomace using a solvent and then undergoing a refining process.
Having looked at the grade classifications, you should have already noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
Olives are much like the grapes used for making wine, in that olives coming from different regions and different varieties will produce different qualities of olive oil.
Optimal Growing Regions for Olive Oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil, temperature, sunlight, air humidity, and precipitation for olive growth.
Beyond the Mediterranean coasts, other areas can only plant sporadically in suitable habitats.
Main producing regions (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and others have similar climates, as do Argentina, Peru, and South Africa, which are far away in southern latitudes.
Olive picking month:
Every year from March to June is the time when olive trees bloom and bear fruit, from July to October the fruit begins to develop and matures, the color of the fruit transitions from green to red, to purple, and finally turns black.
November to February of the following year is the fruit picking season (the freshness of olive oil is very important, you know).
Olive oil's nutritional components:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, specifically oleic acid as well as linoleic acid and linolenic acid, and it also contains vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants, among others.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the fats discovered so far.
The Democracy Summit concludes, Biden says the flame of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy," convened by U.S. President Biden with the participation of governments from 110 countries as well as leaders from civil society and the private sector, concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said the fire of freedom burns in the heart of everyone around the world, and authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also indicated that plans are underway to hold the second global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative, minister without portfolio Audrey Tang, and Hong Kong pro-democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke on the second day of the summit.
Biden said, "We know how daunting the work before us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because as I have said before, and as this summit demonstrates, the democratic world is everywhere.
Despotic regimes can never extinguish the small flame of freedom; it burns in the hearts of people all over the world.
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires the collective efforts of the entire society.
He said: "As leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, push for reforms, and achieve transparent accountability in governance. This makes us better equipped to withstand the buffering and assault from authoritarian forces, as well as those who blatantly pursue power ahead of the public interest."
The themes for the second day of the "Democracy Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, as well as pushing back against digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening remarks that day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions, as well as democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, tackling corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
We must also resolutely condemn all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the exploitation of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong pro-democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law delivered a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding attendees to continue paying attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and among Chinese ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been accepting the rise of China, yet has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must utilize everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority.
Nathan Law also called for solidarity in the free world to confront the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: “Maybe some of you are afraid of angering General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you have not recognized the threat of (the CCP) to our democratic values.”
And this is the reason why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must change.
Taiwan Executive Yuan Minister without Portfolio Audrey Tang attended the roundtable discussion on "Combatting Digital Dictatorship, Affirming Democratic Values" and issued a "National Statement" via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of confronting autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy in Taiwan is still burgeoning, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and have taken on a leading role in promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights worldwide.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world justified human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interest, indicating a regression in global democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without having to lock down, and we can combat misinformation without having to censor.
Just as the second day of the "Democracy Summit" was underway, the US Treasury Department announced that it had imposed sanctions in accordance with the law on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, identified as severely violating human rights. At the same time, investment restrictions were implemented on a Chinese company that was identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have already taken a photo and uploaded it for you.
I know.
But the restaurant keeps delaying the delivery time for some reason.
Originally needed #NUMBER#
Anyway, I'm not calling anymore.
I'm not eating anymore.
I will definitely complain.
If you couldn't deliver it, why didn't you say so earlier?
I've been waiting for you for so long
No, I didn't receive the call.
Please inform him to deliver it to our company again.

I want to cancel the order
Why not cancel it?
Hello, the koushui chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try out tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I am looking for something at a reasonable price to start practicing.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices are often directly proportional to the friendliness. If one cannot discern, then under normal circumstances, the expensive ones are more friendly than the cheaper ones. These so-called "starter rackets" are actually industrial waste.
They have very low intensity; when the ball hits the racket, it causes significant vibration, making hard balls difficult to control, even for experts.
The logic and underlying message behind this is —— tennis is so difficult, knowing that you won't be able to learn it and that you are reluctant to buy expensive gear, they fob you off with some cheap stuff. You'll play a couple of times and then give up playing. This way, the racket is cheap and you won't feel so bad about it.
Once you can truly distinguish between good and bad, it means you've improved. At that point, come back here to buy the expensive ones, and I'll make money twice.
I recommend spending a similar amount of money to buy a better second-hand racket, opt for Prince or Dunlop, which are brands not so well-known so their high-quality rackets don't sell for much. A new racket for 500 to 600 is pretty good, but for a second-hand one, 200 yuan is enough to enjoy what a thousand-yuan racket has to offer, isn't it great?
Friendly to beginners, but once past the beginner stage it becomes of little use. However, most people, especially girls, can't get past the beginner stage.
The order's delivery time has been delayed multiple times.
Can you please help with following up on this?
Postpone
Thank you
So, you mean to say, I actually already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Should I ignore the previous order then?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but many items were missing from the delivery, and the koushui chicken was also raw.

In fact, there are many considerations for plump girls when it comes to clothing and outfit coordination.
The skirts worn by plump girls should not be too short or too long; the length should be about knee-length, just enough to cover the thicker part of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the legs.
If it's too long, it will give the impression of being short and stout.
If you dress in a way that divides your outfit into upper, middle, and lower sections, it will naturally make you appear taller. That is, if the top, skirt, and long socks are in different colors, it will create a lengthening effect.
Actually, many dark-colored clothes are a staple for slightly overweight girls (the author has a deep understanding of this). Dark colors are also a good way to camouflage the fat on your body, and an elegant black skirt is also the first choice for slightly overweight girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially black skirts, can make you appear slimmer.
If your calves are on the bulky side, avoid wearing socks or shoes that are too eye-catching.
The more popular the better, and the colors shouldn't be too bright.
Lest people notice your legs and feet and get the impression of obesity.
For slightly chubby girls, it's essential to talk about the tricks of good clothing matching.
Plus-size girls should avoid wearing tight mini skirts. Also, their tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, as it creates an uncomfortable appearance. If the legs are thick, it's advisable to wear black tights or fishnet stockings (the type with small meshes). Choosing a soft fabric printed trumpet skirt paired with a drape-neck top can effectively conceal the shortcomings of a plus-size girl.
Of course, there are certain considerations for slightly plump girls when it comes to wearing short skirts.
Plus-size girls wearing short skirts should choose tops that match the color of the skirt, as this will create an effect of elongating the figure.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the trendiest combination for summer!
If you are a girl with a plump upper body but slim legs, it is recommended to choose a glamorous short dress.
Not only can it hide your big belly, but it can also highlight your strengths.
A-line skirts are quite slimming and are more suitable for plus-sized girls. It's better to choose a tighter top to create a sense of layering, which will further accentuate the slimming effect.
Simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt, plus-size women can also try.
Slightly plump girls can also have a sense of fashion.
As long as they can grasp the principles of outfit coordination, even slightly plump girls can become the center of attention for everyone.
After making changes in how you dress up, also try to exercise more in life, and strive to shed the label of being slightly overweight sooner rather than later. 😄

Xinhua All-Media+ | Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League Fuels Olympic Enthusiasm - Xinhua Network

Girl becomes target for arrow to raise funds for sister: "Thinking it's just a flesh wound makes it bearable" - Xinhua News
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board in Hangzhou's Wulin Square, with the words "Human Target, Ten Yuan per Arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo titled "Hangzhou girl willingly becomes a 'human target' to raise funds for her sister" went viral on WeChat Moments.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a wooden board slightly taller than a person at Hangzhou's Wulin Square, with the words “Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow” written on it, indicating that passersby can pay to shoot arrows at the target.
The behavior sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiacheng District branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police have verified that the girl engaged in such radical actions to raise donations for her sister. However, such behavior is not encouraged. After being admonished, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The girl was warned for soliciting donations as a "target" on the street.
In the viral photo, a long-haired girl is seen standing in a "human-shaped" posture in front of a large wooden board. On the board, inscribed with black ink are the words "Human Target, 10 Yuan per Arrow". In front of her, another board displays her bank account details along with WeChat and Alipay account information.
The image went viral online and sparked controversy.
Some netizens believe that this is an "attention-seeking begging behavior," while many also express sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation around 10 a.m. on the 23rd when we were patrolling next to the square, and by that time there were already quite a few onlookers."
The police from Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said in an interview with the local media that there were two girls at the stall, both about 20 years old, dressed youthfully and beautifully.
Among them, the girl acting as a "human target" kept crying, pleading with passersby to play the game; another girl was shouting from the side, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and urgently needs money for surgery, asking everyone to help out.
We have made contact with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was fundraising for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the spokesperson for the Public Security Bureau of Xiacheng District, Hangzhou, told The Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Ji Jiali, fundraising for her elder sister Ji Jiayan.
But because the treatment still requires more than 300,000 yuan in expenses, and no good fundraising methods could be thought of at the moment, this course of action was taken.
He said that throughout the process, one girl acted as the target while the other assisted, but did not participate. No one was found to be shooting arrows during the entire process; there were only onlookers who took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After appraisal by the public security department, the bow and arrow used were determined to be outside the scope of controlled items.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate using this type of sensationalism to raise donations."
After being cautioned by the police at the local police station, she has left the station.
Cooling effect: Good Slimness: Convenient Appearance and material: Satisfied Acer has always had a great price-to-performance ratio.
The new machine is very good.
Performance is stable, with four vents for cooling, no problems there, worth recommending.
This Acer Predator Helios gaming laptop is pretty good, with solid craftsmanship and materials, a reliable brand!
Acer Predator Helios is not considered expensive in terms of price.
I personally think the Acer Predator Helios is really good. Gaming performance: The gaming experience is comfortable, and I can enjoy playing most games smoothly. My PUBG runs with high frame rates steadily, which is very smooth. LoL is even less of an issue, and CS:GO is also easily handled. Most triple-A games can be played.
Cooling effect: The cooling performance is good, the fan is powerful, and it operates quietly for work. When gaming with all effects on, the fan is still quite noticeable.
Exterior Material: The appearance is pretty cool, just what a gaming laptop should be like. Display Effect: The screen is very clear, and 1080 is enough for gaming.
Buying the notebook feels quite alright, it's really nice. It's mainly used for design work, and its cost-performance ratio is very high. It's lighter than I imagined and also looks better than I expected. The red on the back is a very nice wine color, not too garish. Overall, it far exceeds my expectations; it's quite worth the purchase and also quite suitable for girls.
Two years ago, I started using the Acer Aspire Nitro and over the course of two years, its cost-performance ratio was quite high and its quality was solid!
I also recommend to my friends to buy this product!
Currently, I have purchased three models of this series!
The appearance is beautiful and good-looking, and the configuration is also very good.
I bought it for my nephew, originally planning to wait for the April 18th bank promotion, but he needed it urgently, so I made the purchase early and missed the big bank event, which is a bit regrettable.
However, the cost performance is quite high, and the logistics is also quite fast. I'll give additional feedback after using it for a while.
Brand new and original, this gaming laptop offers an excellent cost-performance ratio and features a stylish design, already equipped with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought it for the child for 3D rendering, the software is already installed, the child says it can be used without any problem, this computer's performance for 3D design work is satisfactory.
Bought it for my son, he said it's very good.
The computer is quite good, especially the customer service attitude is very good. Just ask if you don't understand, I recommend buying it.
Not bad, the graphics quality for gaming is really awesome.
What was the hottest trend in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it's the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win medals?
The article "Look! Project Managers Can Tackle Gold-Medal Olympic Events" was trending recently, stating that project managers definitely take the lead in many projects, unmatched by peers: moving bricks, business trips, and working overnight are part of the daily routine for project managers, while firefighting, shouldering blame, and apologizing are all in a day's work.
An article that appears to be jokingly teasing actually speaks to the daily hardships of project managers, representing the helplessness they feel towards the current state of project management work.
People engaged in project management are also gradually choosing to take some actions to extricate themselves from difficulties in their work.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional with international certification) applicants each year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "Twenty Years Development Report of Project Management in China (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® exam registrants in the country is nearly 600,000, the number of people who have passed the PMP® certification is about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders is about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the global total of PMP® certificate holders.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMP (Project Management Professional) certificate holders has been increasing year by year. This indicates that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to rely solely on copying the "old experience" of the past. The rapidly changing work environment makes us aware that one must learn to explore the path forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, can passing the PMP ensure that project management work will proceed smoothly without any hindrance?
Many project management beginners indicate that by studying courses like PMP/IPMP, they can systematically grasp the ten knowledge areas and the five process groups related to project management, but when it actually comes to managing a project, they still feel completely at sea.
Many project managers often report the following issues: Inadequate understanding of project management, reliance solely on personal experience, possessing theoretical knowledge of project management without knowing how to put it into practice; lacking systematic project management processes and institutional support, resulting in an inability to implement in the work environment, inaccurate project estimations, poor control and sensitivity, leading to repeated project delays; unclear division of tasks among members, the team's "old hands" are at a loss on how to deal with situation. Cross-departmental assistance and communication are not smooth, making it difficult to advance the project...

Just before "Double Twelve," Home Credit advocates rational consumption to consumers - Economic Observer - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" shopping festival reached a transaction volume of 1.77 trillion yuan in nationwide online payment services, setting a new record compared to previous years.
A variety of full discount red envelopes and attention-grabbing live commerce have once again led consumers to exclaim their benefits. This consumption craze, on one hand, makes one marvel at the increasingly strong spending power of the population. On the other hand, it also necessitates a sober reflection on the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
Ahead of the "Double 12" shopping event, Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding consumers, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits, and to reject blind and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index stands at 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, residents in our country perform well in terms of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in various aspects of financial behavior and skills, and there is still a need for further improvement in the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy levels of the elderly and youth are relatively low, and the "old and young" will continue to be the key target audiences for financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Situation Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has tremendous consumption potential, with credit consumption becoming an important avenue for consumption upgrades. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half are not accumulating debt. Although the younger generation as a whole tends to consume rationally, which is quite different from the label of "overspending" that is often attached to them externally, some young people do indeed engage in excessive consumption and trend-following buying behavior, thereby creating significant financial pressure and debt risk, and even leading to a gradual increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should bravely take on social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Home Credit has always been committed to assisting people in building their own happy lives with high-quality, thoughtful services, advocating for consumers to establish a positive and correct view of consumption, and actively responding to regulatory calls to enhance consumer awareness of rational consumption, especially among the young demographic.
Over the past years, Home Credit has been carrying out comprehensive and diversified financial literacy activities aimed at young people, including university students, and has subtly influenced the consumption needs of this group through reasonable guidance by launching innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic universities, helping them establish rational consumption concepts, plan their consumer demands reasonably, and thereby contributing to the accumulation of their lifetime wealth.
As Double 12 arrives, Home Credit reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and correct view of money, to resist blind and excessive consumption, and to avoid misconceptions about consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future financial life.
When spending, be sure to plan ahead, live within your means, and repay on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the individual credit report and may adversely affect economic activities such as buying a car or purchasing a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to verify whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to leverage its mature and reliable consumer finance system, along with its constantly updated financial products, to provide consumers with services that are more tailored to their needs and diversified. It will persistently help the public to improve their financial literacy, and assist consumers in developing concepts of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, striving to be a lifelong, trustworthy consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnam People's Daily Online - Gulf Cooperation Council addresses common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since the imposition of an embargo on Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies in mid-2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, having a negative impact on the economy of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blockaded the land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, where the Gulf nations signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait aimed at "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are making efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to Qatar as a first step.
Gulf Arab states resolve differences to restore relations with Qatar, stemming from the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, and to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, both parties agreed to open the first direct land passageway between the two Gulf neighbors.
The corridor, spanning 725 kilometers between the two countries, will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of both nations and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest 5 billion US dollars in Oman, and enterprises from the two countries have signed 13 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with a value of 30 billion US dollars.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to the Gulf countries coincides with negotiations between Iran and major world powers to save the so-called "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" (JCPOA), an Iranian nuclear agreement condemned by Gulf Arab states for failing to address the issue of Iranian missiles.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and see Iran’s nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to resolve the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Direct negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Iran took place against the backdrop of the major powers failing to meet the expectations of the Gulf countries in the nuclear talks with Iran.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slow down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit for the GCC countries since the resolution of disputes with Qatar by some member states.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the promotion of restoring unity within the GCC, while proposing various measures that ensure full cooperation among its member states to address common challenges, contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf nations.

Known for having the loudest supercar exhaust sound in the Xinshan District!
This time, our team brings everyone this car, which is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago — the Aventador LP700-4!
Asking for nearly two million ringgit, the annual road tax is over ten thousand ringgit, all-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast that is?
Well, forget it. Even the editor doesn't know. The data says it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which is probably about the time it takes for the editor's Myvi to reach 30km/h, others have already hit 100km/h, hm.
A low-profile body, ostentatious scissor doors, massive air intakes all around, and a 6.5 V12 engine in full view beneath the glass, perfectly encapsulate the style of Lamborghini.
There's no need to go into too much detail about the car models, just Google it for yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google might not provide!
Too much attention is focused on me; wherever I go, everyone is watching, which makes me quite uncomfortable! (Actually, it's kind of cool)
1km fuel cost is about RM1 (car owners basically don't care)
Practice getting in and out of the car to avoid embarrassment, otherwise, you might get stuck halfway out because you can't climb out of the compartment.
The engine noise is so loud that you'll go momentarily deaf after getting out of the car. (But it's still thrilling.)
The car body is too large, and parking in a regular parking space would be very tight. I'm really afraid of getting hit by the doors of the adjacent car when they open!
A bit lonely, because there's no rival on the road (That's what the editor says, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Everyone, please don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your beloved car, welcome to contact us!

Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News Agency
The so-called spirit of a university refers to a series of educational philosophies and value pursuits that are long-term accumulations formed during the development process of a university; it is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been of vital importance to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, and society, as well as to the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For our country's universities, which emerged during the national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating moral integrity and benefitting the world, fostering personal virtue and governing in peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "promoting education to strengthen the nation."
Currently, the trends of informatization and internationalization in higher education are becoming increasingly apparent. The global competition in education, science and technology, and talent continues to intensify. As an important "supply side," the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
The introduction of the "Overall Plan for Coordinating the Advancement of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" not only demonstrates our country's confidence and determination to transition from a major higher education country to a powerful higher education nation but also sets forth higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How can we strive to become a world-class entity in a relatively short period of time and hasten the establishment of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having certain gaps, and realize the "overtaking on a curve"?
In addition to firm confidence in goals, paths, and abilities, universities should also fully leverage three advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talent from overseas, learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities, to achieve significant improvements in academic standards and education quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom accumulated over five thousand years of Chinese civilization, promoting and developing the excellent traditional culture to gather strengths, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, the institutional advantage, utilizing the superiorities of the socialist country’s system, strengthening goal-driven efforts, building consensus, optimizing resource allocation, providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to rapidly catch up with and surpass world advanced levels.
It is particularly important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach; each institution must not only play to its strengths but also highlight its unique character and features.
The characteristics of school management should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their own unique goal orientation, educational traditions, and resource endowments.
Regarding Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects in running the school: First is the emphasis on the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated educational environment that combines science and education with school-enterprise collaboration, forming a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second is the emphasis on the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, creating an institutional environment for interdisciplinary interaction, and actively nurturing new emerging interdisciplinary fields and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; third is the emphasis on the characteristics of the education system and social services, conducting in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a comprehensive Zhejiang University-industry-research collaboration system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, allowing the spirit of the university to resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto "Seeking Truth and Innovation," the common values of "Diligence, Morality, Discernment, and Trustworthiness," along with the ideals of "Embracing Diversity, Fostering Integrity, Leading Innovation, and Serving the Nation" together form the latest expression of the Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural height, and gather spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and profound in meaning.
Among them, "Embracing Rivers and Seas" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the breadth of embracing talents from all over the world and is manifested in the adoption of high-quality educational concepts from world-renowned universities; "Cultivating True Virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and utmost goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also fostering virtue and honing character; "Pioneering and Enlightening" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of new knowledge, scientific research, and innovations, as well as reflecting reform and development, and the transformation of the old for the new; "Building Our Nation" emphasizes the spirit of patriotic dedication, stating that universities should always share the honor and disgrace with the nation's fate.
This series of spiritual philosophies and value pursuits is precisely the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"The wise hear things in silence, the enlightened perceive things before they take shape."
Chinese universities should further anchor themselves in the overall cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly understand the epochal position and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate their development into world-class universities.
At the same time, by adhering to humanistic care and independence and freedom, we allow the spirit of the university to interact with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, thereby providing an inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and for achieving the common ideals of mankind.

Guangxi university students' entrepreneurship leave can last up to 5 years - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 19 (Special Correspondent Zhang Ying) - Reporters recently learned from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department that, in the future, universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible educational system and relax the limit on the number of years that college students can take a leave of absence. The duration for current students to suspend their studies for entrepreneurship can be extended by 2 to 5 years beyond their original educational system, and the time taken off for business creation can be considered as practical education time.
To foster the enhancement of entrepreneurship and innovation abilities among university students, departments such as education and human resources in Guangxi have collaborated to build entrepreneurial platforms, establishing more off-campus practice teaching bases, university science and technology parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases, to provide external support for college students' entrepreneurial efforts.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in universities should reach over 3,000 square meters for undergraduate institutions and over 2,000 square meters for higher vocational colleges.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and gives priority support to students who excel in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to change their majors.
University teachers are required to take at least two months of temporary positions in industry enterprises every two years, in order to enhance their awareness and ability in innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Department of Education of the Autonomous Region requires universities in Guangxi to thoroughly implement the innovation and entrepreneurship training program for college students, striving to ensure that every college student participates in an innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their time in school.
Universities should actively organize students to participate in innovative and entrepreneurial competitions of all levels and provide financial support.
University of Macau Awards Honorary Doctorate to Seven Distinguished Individuals
University of Macau today (11th) held the "2021 Honorary and Higher Degree Conferment Ceremony", awarding honorary doctorate degrees to Zengyi Liu, Kaixian Chen, Shuji Nakamura, Lanjuan Li, Xiaoliang Li, Lulan Zhu, and Zhaohui Jiang in recognition of their outstanding achievements and significant contributions to the development of society and education.
At the award ceremony, the Chief Executive and the Chancellor of the University of Macau, represented by the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, Ao Ieong U, conferred the honorary doctorate degree accompanied by the Chairman of the University Council of the University of Macau, Lam Kam Seng, and the President of the University of Macau, Song Yonghua.

During his address, Ouyang Yu began by extending warm congratulations and the highest respects to the seven distinguished individuals who were awarded honorary doctorate degrees for their extraordinary achievements in various fields, having made outstanding contributions to the development of the country and the progress of the world. Additionally, Ouyang Yu expressed the sincerest blessings to the graduates and their parents, and also conveyed heartfelt respect to the dedicated and academically accomplished team of university faculty and staff.
During the lecture at the Faculty of Arts of Macao University, Professor Sun Yifeng, when reading the commendation for Professor Liu Zunyi, stated that Professor Liu Zunyi is a world-renowned economist, famous for his outstanding academic achievements and visionary educational philosophy.
In addition to his achievements in economic development, economic growth, and East Asian economy, he is also a visionary leader in education.
In short, he has made outstanding contributions in many fields.
When Sun Yifeng was reading the eulogy for Shuji Nakamura, he stated that Professor Shuji Nakamura is a pioneer in sustainable energy technology.
He became one of the three laureates of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing the blue light-emitting diode (LED).
Professor Nakamura's invention not only completely transformed the lighting industry, but also led to the development of white light-emitting diodes, which are now widely used in daily life and industrial production, making a significant contribution to human welfare.
When Sun Yifeng read the commendation for Li Lanjuan, it was noted that Professor Li Lanjuan, as the pioneer of China's artificial liver project, established the unique and effective Li’s Artificial Liver System, achieving a significant breakthrough in the treatment of severe hepatitis and liver failure, and substantially reducing the mortality rate of liver failure.

During the rapid popularization of NFTs, the crypto community has come up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in the Southeast Asia region, where some residents who lost their job opportunities due to the pandemic began to earn a steady income by playing this game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet nurturing game that incorporates various gameplay elements including NFTs. It is currently the highest-grossing NFT project, with transactions exceeding 3 billion US dollars to date.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds $8.2 million, closely competing with "Honor of Kings."
On August 6 this year, the official Axie Infinity announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has introduced a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just passive participants; they not only derive enjoyment and economic benefits from the game but can also take part in governing the game's ecosystem.
This kind of agency is not granted by the game producers, but rather, it is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a piece of news about the stock price of a friend's company, my biggest takeaway is the selection of the "track" for enterprises, that is, the choice of the industry for investment targets. First and foremost, choose industries with a large growth potential, at least with a market size of over 100 billion. Next, select industries that are expected to have good growth in the future, considering those that will reach their optimal state of industry growth in the next 3-5 years. Lastly, opt for industries with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first task is to summarize 2021 and adjust the strategic layout for 2022.
Strategy is about "doing the right things," while tactics are about "doing things right."
And strategy is about "doing the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics are about implementation. Above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic contemplation.
For instance, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or to expand horizontally into other fields (strategic thinking); for example, beyond improving customer retention rates (tactical thinking), you can think about how to enhance the retention rates of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of increasing event participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct event KPIs and achieve the right event goals, such as enhancing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately acquiring new customers; when looking at increasing DAU (Daily Active Users) (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
After 12 years of its creation, Bitcoin witnessed several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American nation of El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender, marking the first time Bitcoin has been recognized as the official currency of a country or region.
October 12th, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved for the first time in eight years the launch of a Bitcoin ETF by ProShares, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This marks the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF on the US capital market, signifying a further expansion of exposure to cryptocurrency investments.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the lead actor.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot," which enhanced the anonymity of transactions on the Bitcoin network and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the structure of the data within the blocks themselves.

Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist for giving me a unique bridal photo.
Thank you to all the staff who worked on the wedding photo shoot today, looking forward to the finished photos.
Taking wedding photos is simply a physical task, especially for the photographer who has to run and jump around.
The makeup artist thoughtfully designed a makeup look that suited my face shape, and the photographer was humorous and amusing during the shoot, which is praiseworthy.
Thanks to my photographer and makeup artist, I can still see how beautiful I can be in my lifetime.
Praises for the lady: she has beautiful eyes and a generous and proper appearance. At first glance, she seems to be a virtuous wife and good mother, who will manage the household with diligence and frugality in the future.

The most important thing when taking wedding photos is that both the photographer and the makeup artist have good aesthetic judgment, and fortunately, I've met them.
Seeing my wedding photos, I realized that I am also "deceptive in pictures."
Asian-American Groups Complain of Admission Discrimination by Yale and Other Two Ivy League Schools - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) - Over 130 Asian American groups submitted complaints to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting against Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, three Ivy League institutions, for discriminating against Asian applicants in their admissions processes.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
During a press conference, the group's chairman, Zhao Yukong, stated that over the past decade, the number of Asian applicants meeting the admission criteria of prestigious American universities has doubled. However, within these three top American schools, the proportion of Asians has remained essentially the same.
Many studies have shown that these institutions of higher education, during the so-called "holistic review" admissions process, "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants."
Zhao Yukong explained that studies by Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that, in these three universities, Asians had the lowest admission rates compared to their application numbers among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League institutions, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas on Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News agency reporters that after filing the complaint, they hope that the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice would initiate an investigation, and upon establishing the facts, take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian applicants in their admissions process.
They also hope that the universities being complained about will take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies for Asian applicants.
Currently, the three universities that were complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Educational Alliance was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups, those participating in the appeal also include American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani heritage educational organizations.
Need cutlery.
Just cancelled the order
Why is it still executing?
Can you help me check if there's any cancellation?
But I already placed the order at 5:09 AM.
That's the ordering hotline, they say they don't know anything.
Is there a phone number I can use to contact them directly?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agent. After visiting the site several times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, after negotiating the details of the factory purchase with the property owner's family member, Mr. Lin, Mr. Lu made a down payment of 200,000 yuan via bank transfer on the same day.
Lin, as the payee, signed on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt," which stated, "If the buyer no longer wishes to purchase the factory, the deposit shall belong to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell the factory, the deposit shall be returned double to the buyer. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase contract within a week."
However, afterward, both parties were unable to form a consensus on the major terms of the contract, such as the scope of the factory sale and the method of payment, resulting in the housing sale contract not being signed for a long time.
Considering that both parties failed to reach a consensus on the contract content, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
Mr. Lu is helpless and angry that the seller backed out just before signing the contract for the house he had finally chosen, after he had paid the deposit and prepared the full payment.
In light of this, Mr. Lu brought Mr. Lin to court at the Yuyao People's Court.
The court believes after the hearing that the failure of both parties to sign a formal contract cannot be solely attributed to the defendant. It should be reasonably presumed that the negotiations were unsuccessful. Therefore, the stipulations for earnest money penalties are not applicable in this case, and the defendant is not required to assume the liability for returning the earnest money in double.
After the first trial verdict, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original verdict.
[Legal Reminder] In the transaction process, it is necessary to exercise due diligence and attention.
When signing a contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence, such as verifying the property owner's information and whether the house is occupied by others, etc., and to specify the exact time and location of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between both parties when fulfilling the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese) After the "Summit for Democracy" ended on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke on Saturday (December 11th), stating that the United States' hosting of the "Summit for Democracy" represents "drawing lines based on ideology, instrumentalizing and weaponizing democracy, practicing anti-democracy under the guise of democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and diverting domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and ideological values on others, promoting 'democratic transformation', recklessly applying unilateral sanctions, and instigating 'color revolutions', resulting in disastrous consequences.
"Democracy" has long become the "weapon of mass destruction" that the United States uses to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action for Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was held via video link, with leaders from 111 countries around the world invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for issues with its own democracy, stating that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
There have been voices of skepticism both internationally and domestically in the United States, such as critiques of the invitations extended to leaders with authoritarian tendencies, including those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some doubt that the true intention behind the Biden administration's organization of this summit is for democracy, rather than for geopolitical purposes.
The newly inaugurated German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the virtual Democracy Summit.
The statement from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is fully exhibiting its pathological conditions, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, partisan opposition, political polarization, social division, racial tensions, and widening wealth gap becoming increasingly severe," and that democracy in the United States is a "rich man's game" founded on capital.
In his speech, U.S. President Biden stated, "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the bulwarks of democracy, promote reform, and achieve transparent accountable governance, which is more capable of withstanding the buffering and impact of despotism, as well as those who blatantly pursue power before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not to be taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it within each generation, which, in my view, is the decisive challenge of our era."
Biden also said that as global democracy and human rights "face persistent and worrisome challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The U.S. side has pledged that, following this Democracy Summit, they will launch a year-long campaign, including an initiative worth $424.4 million, to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
The United States hopes that all countries will make specific and public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the in-person Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of our nations implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent it to the wrong address.
Ri Chang Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
[Mint] Environment: Standard [Service Bell] Service: Fast serving "Traditional Ma Lai Gao" is my must-order dish. The Ma Lai Gao is so fragrant, soft, and delicious😋. Friends who like desserts must try the "Dongjiang Squid Ink Silky Tofu Hotpot". The soup is extremely savory, and the tofu is very tender. Ink...
Tasty flavors, good meat, warm service
It's been a long time since I last visited Richang, and the fruit punch is still delicious & really rich and substantial. It's my first time ordering the char siu bao, and it's exactly the soft and fluffy southern-style taste that I love!
The clay pot rice has just the right level of moisture, the portion is very generous, the signature foil-wrapped chicken wings are as good as always, and the soup of the day is also quite good. The Chinese broccoli is also relatively well-prepared...
Tasty flavor, enthusiastic service, good quality meat.
Ri Chang's old store was an internet celebrity presence many years ago too, with the Dongdan mansion and wooden floors.
The claypot rice that always requires a long wait at the entrance, the pots for the claypot rice are all cracked...
It's been several years since I last went to eat at Ri Chang, the rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has diverted the customer flow.
It's rare to get a seat as soon as you arrive at the restaurant, and the quality of the dishes is undeniable; as always, they are good.
Tasty flavors, good meats, great staple food.
Ri Chang Takeout.
[Rice] Meal: The dish was a bit of a disappointment this time.
Three-cup chicken: there are a bit too many side dishes, and the chicken is slightly on the lesser side.
The primary flavor of this dish is a bit off; the base flavor isn't salty enough, which accentuates the sweetness. Everyone can imagine a combination of sweet with various spices and side dishes...
What's the way to drink Red Label Whisky?
Different people have different hobbies; some like collecting, some enjoy gourmet food, and of course, some like tasting wine. Red Label Whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies across various countries, and it has also won a gold medal at the International Spirits Competition.
Each bottle of Red Label whiskey has a unique flavor, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, isn't it a waste of its richness?
So how do you drink Red Label whiskey?
The editor will give a brief introduction for everyone.
Red Card Whisky Drinking Method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from around 35 different Scotch whiskies, possessing a rich aroma and the traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky, with a rich fragrance that has a sweet and smoky scent.
The entrance is rich and fresh, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be drunk directly with ice added, or mixed with your favorite beverage.
Red Label Whisky enters the domestic market, and to cater to the taste of the locals, Red Label Whisky mixed with cola, Sprite, or Sunkist and other carbonated drinks has become an enduring trend.
These sweet-tasting drinks not only neutralize the sourness but also bring visual pleasure and, when added to beverages, dilute the alcohol taste and change the mouthfeel.
Red Label Whisky + sliced lemon + cube sugar (granulated sugar is also fine) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
The authentic taste of red vermouth is somewhat tangy, adding sugar can neutralize the acidity, and lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three methods are the best ways to enjoy Red Label whisky. Everyone can try them out as a reference. I hope my introduction can be of help to everyone.
Educational Reflection: How University Exams Allow "Top Students" and "Underachievers" to Find Their Place - Xinhua Net
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders reflecting their confusion about the university exams, and proposed to increase the difficulty of exams, change the types of exam questions, so that the exams would truly reflect the actual abilities of students.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic."
In the university campus, students come from all corners of the country, with different levels of ability, and varying degrees of learning, making their learning situations vastly different.
Assessing a group with such diverse characteristics, it's inevitable that there will be different perceptions.
Of course, if the types of exam questions are monotonous, have a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different sensation.
Students who do not study diligently might be able to pass by cramming just before the exam. If they look for other methods, they might achieve better results with half the effort.
Thus, a "strange phenomenon" arises where the "slacker students" can pass or even score high without much effort; while the "top students" never miss a class, have excellent homework and notes, but don't score much higher in exams.
This suggests that the concerns raised by the students at Lanzhou Jiaotong University about the problems in university examinations are not without cause, and it is believed that such situations exist not only at Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, a round of applause is deserved for these three students who expressed their concerns candidly in writing.
In fact, those who have attended college are well aware that it is not uncommon for students to cram for exams, try various means to "extract" test questions from teachers, strive to narrow down the scope of the test, and seek “focused tutoring” before the exam. Even carrying cheat sheets during the test and pleading with teachers for leniency after the test are not unheard of.
In my view, as an assessment orientation for evaluating teaching quality, determining whether a university's examination is passable depends more on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific question setting based on this understanding.
Entering the undergraduate stage of university, majors begin to become more specialized, with many professional courses focusing primarily on foundational knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a discipline is the content that university examinations aim to assess.
Undergraduate knowledge is essentially the fundamental theories and basic knowledge of the discipline. In terms of knowledge points, there is not much room for change; it is essentially fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics that was learned 20 years ago is still being studied today, and it remains a focus."
But the fact that knowledge points remain essentially unchanged does not mean that the exam question types are monotonous or that questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams typically involve the formation of a question-setting team, and the test papers are coordinated by senior teachers of the subject. The grading of the exams is also undertaken by all the teachers responsible for that subject, which can to some extent overcome the issue of question repetition.
To devise a set of test questions suitable for the reality of teaching and learning, the difficulty of the questions should follow a normal distribution based on the overall learning situation of the students. It also requires a comprehensive mastery of the teaching context and a thorough analysis of the students' learning level. Thus, the examination design should dynamically manage the difficulty and question types. It should highlight the inspection of basic knowledge while also taking into account the assessment of abilities, and simultaneously carry out innovative design for question types.
Examinations are the baton of university education; whatever the nature of the examinations, students will have corresponding study plans. Over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Regarding the suggestion letter from the students, the administration of Lanzhou Jiaotong University highly values it and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Each teaching unit is required to organize teachers to carry out discussions and a self-examination comparison for the final course examination, to formulate examination paper setting and relevant policies, while also strengthening the supervision and inspection of the examination paper setting and review process, refine the grading evaluation, and enhance the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course instruction.
Addressing issues like the lack of diversity in exam questions and repeated problems from a systemic perspective is an issue that university exam administration must confront. Of course, corresponding systems must be implemented, but the key is in daily efforts. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. They must not only have a deep understanding of the content taught but also a profound grasp of the students' learning conditions. With a thorough understanding at both ends, teaching and learning will align better, fostering a positive interaction. Exams will then be more practical, allowing both the "straight-A students" and the "underachievers" to find their rightful places.
If it's not possible to change the location of the branch for me, can it be changed to delivery instead?
So I don't have to pay any more money, right?
The colleague's order has already been delivered.
I can't finish pulling it.
GPS? Has it arrived yet?
Mrs. Jin's Bridal Photography (South Street Store) currently does not have any branches.
Before the photoshoot, because we didn't schedule our time well, we changed the time twice. Consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the schedule.
I later chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
Mrs. Jin's staff, whether they are consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all superb.
That was the first time I ever put on makeup formally in my life, wow~ I can't believe that one day I would become so pretty, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (I'm sorry, I can't remember her name) are super patient with makeup, and the makeup looks very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in Jiangwan City, luckily the weather was very good that day, I didn't feel very cold. During the photoshoot, the makeup artist would intermittently pay attention to our clothes and headpieces and would immediately tidy them up if anything was slightly amiss.
The photographer is also very humorous; I felt very happy after a whole day of taking photos.
While choosing photos, because I saw many examples online, I was reluctant to let customers delete too many photos. But when we were selecting them, honestly, there wasn't even a hint of an intention to let us add more photos. We just went with the 24 photos included in the package without adding any (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos around the same time as me, added over 10,000 photos to her package that was already more than 7,000, which really shocked me, and I was also very afraid that I would choose too many).
Today, the photos were fixed and Lan Lan sent them to me. I found two that I didn't think were very good, and they immediately helped me fix them again.
Looking back at the photos my sister took before and comparing them, I am truly satisfied with our pictures; they are simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jin Furen for wedding photos!
Package Price: 3999 Yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have you and sincerely wishes you happiness and a bright future!

Your name is Zheng Mian, and this is your second week since you moved to Japan.
As you walk down the street, you suddenly realize someone is following you. You become scared and start walking faster until you eventually start running.
That person chased after you, calling from behind: "Miss! Please wait!" (The entire conversation is in Japanese.) You stopped at the entrance of the convenience store.
"Miss... I am a director, and I see that you are very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?"
You are very confused and afraid that this is a scam.
He handed you a business card, and you found out that he really is a director of a large Japanese entertainment company.
"Miss, if you have the time, we can talk in the company. The remuneration will certainly not be less."
He said that he spotted you on the street at a glance and was very hopeful that you would come to participate.
You thought there wasn't much to lose and you could make money, so you signed the contract.

So, can the system see the new order?
Then how will that rider be dealt with?
I think I can't accept that the order hasn't been delivered even after waiting 20 more minutes.
The birth certificates of 3,200 newborns in Sabah are on hold due to a shortage of special anti-fraud paper.
(Sabah, 11th news) The Sabah National Registration Department stated that since the special anti-forgery paper stock has been exhausted, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since the beginning of October, accumulating up to 3,200 affected individuals to date.
However, Director Kairu Aminu assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates, their information has already been recorded in the system, and the certificates will be issued once the security paper arrives next week.
He explained at the press conference, in response to an online media outlet's report that there had been issues with the printing of Sabah's newspaper on newsprint for as long as 10 months.
He said that the issue arose two months ago and Sarawak is facing the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturer producing the special anti-counterfeit paper was affected by the pandemic, resulting in delayed delivery to our country.
He explained that the banknote paper used in Sabah is different from that in other regions, so they cannot borrow stock from other states.
Kairu Aminu revealed that the latest batch of security paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
"The bureau will dispatch someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and upon returning to Sabah, the final stage of printing will commence immediately. It is estimated that the documents can be handed over to the applicant within an additional 2 working days (December 20th)."
"We will notify the applicants to go to the various branches to collect the birth certificates."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
I've been waiting since a little after 7 o'clock until now.
Are we almost there?
I am referring to food.
I am waiting across from #PRS_ORG# again.
Sure, thank you, as the restaurant said it is ready.
People's Daily Commentator: "14th Five-Year Plan" achieves a good start — Discussing the implementation of the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11th - People's Daily commentary article of December 12th: "A Good Start to the 14th Five-Year Plan" - On Studying and Implementing the Spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference.
"Achieving a good start to the '14th Five-Year Plan'," the Central Economic Work Conference held from December 8th to 10th highly praised the achievements made in our country's economic and social development over the past year.
General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the meeting, where he profoundly summarized the economic work of 2021, conducted an in-depth analysis of the current economic situation, and made significant arrangements for the economic work of 2022. This provides us with a clear direction and fundamental principles to follow in order to do well in next year's economic endeavors and to welcome the victorious convening of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party.
We solemnly celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, officially announce the complete establishment of a moderately prosperous society, and achieve the first centenary goal. We have embarked on a new journey to fully build a modern socialist country and advance towards the second centenary goal.
We convened the sixth plenary session of the 19th Central Committee of the Party to sum up the major achievements and historical experiences of the Party's hundred years of struggle, and passed the third historical resolution in the Party's century-long history, the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Major Achievements and Historical Experiences of the Party Over the Past Century." This is a political declaration for the Communists of the new era to remember our original aspiration and mission, to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, and serves as a guide for learning from history to forge ahead into the future and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Over the past year, the world has experienced changes unseen in a century, and the global pandemic of COVID-19 has interwoven effects. The external environment has become increasingly complex and severe, and the domestic tasks of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development have been extremely arduous and onerous.
The Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, insists on coordinating the domestic and international big pictures, adhering to the general principle of seeking progress amidst stability, calmly dealing with the profound changes of the century and the pandemic, coordinating epidemic control and economic and social development, accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, strengthening macro-policy counter-cyclical adjustments, focusing on promoting the sustained and healthy development of the economy, intensively deepening reform, opening up and innovation, striving to fulfill the arduous tasks of reform and development, and achieving new major accomplishments in various undertakings of the Party and country.
"The 14th Five-Year Plan has gotten off to a good start, with one important aspect being that new steps have been taken to construct a new development pattern, and new achievements have been made in high-quality development."
Our country's economic development and epidemic prevention and control maintain a leading global position, with characteristics of strong resilience, great potential, and sufficient momentum continuing to emerge; the national strategic scientific and technological forces are growing rapidly, with major innovative achievements emerging in competition, the capability of scientific and technological innovation is continuously improving, and new breakthroughs are achieved in tackling key core technologies; the resilience of industrial chains has been enhanced, foreign trade has increased in quality and volume, with a continued optimization of the structure, and new drivers of growth represented by new industries, business forms, and models are thriving; reform and opening-up are making in-depth progress, focusing on clearing the blockages that restrict the matching of supply and demand and the flow of factors, and creating new cooperative and competitive advantages through high-level opening-up; livelihood security is strong and effective, the scale of employment is continuously expanding, residents' income growth is roughly in sync with economic growth, annual grain production has been maintained at over 1.3 trillion jin for seven consecutive years, achieving the "eighteenth consecutive bountiful harvest"; the construction of an ecological civilization is continuously advancing, with the work on peaking carbon dioxide emissions and achieving carbon neutrality being coordinated, a steady pace in the green and low-carbon transition, and new achievements in ecological and environmental protection.
These achievements have been attained under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, guided by the scientific principles of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and are the result of the concerted and strenuous efforts of the whole Party and people of all ethnic groups across the country.

Super convenient, just like opening it on a computer, it solved the problem of insufficient hard drive space on my computer.
Today, the brand-new solid-state mobile hard drive arrived, but the computer cannot read the mobile solid-state drive and does not recognize it, whereas the computer can read a USB flash drive.
The machine is nimble and easy to handle, with an elegant and attractive appearance.
Today, after using it for an afternoon, the cooling is excellent, hardly feel it overheating, it runs very fast, and boots up in seconds, outperforming 99% of users.
The battery is also very strong, with 9 hours of standby time and 4 hours of usage should not be a problem. In short, being able to get a machine of this quality for this price makes me very happy. I will add more about other features as I discover them.
The appearance is pretty good.
Performance-wise, evaluate it after using it for a while.
The machine is fast, bigger than expected, and renders excellent graphics, satisfied, will follow up with another review after using it for a while.
Not bad, not bad, the machine's serial number can be found in Hong Kong's records, the quality should be OK.
It feels not so much large as it is heavy; it's actually not very big as it just barely exceeds 15.6 inches. When running, it's indeed very stable and there's no feeling of lag; I love the sound of the fan cooling - it's very noticeable, yet it doesn't keep spinning incessantly like a gaming laptop's fan would.
The product is nice and much cheaper than the official flagship store; they also included a backpack as a gift, which I think is pretty good.
The service from the store was also good; they reminded me to update the BIOS, and they promptly issued an invoice.
Worth it!
Heat dissipation effect: The cooling is very good, with virtually no heat. Slimness: Convenient to carry. Exterior material: Traditional Thinkpad design, satisfactory.
Reputable seller, carefully examined the entire appearance of the device and all ports, no signs of refurbishment or prior use, it is indeed a brand-new US version as described on the listing.
Forgot to send the backpack, immediately helped me resend another backpack, although it's not the original standard backpack, the service follow-up is enough to prove that they are a conscientious seller.
If a friend needs to buy a laptop, then buy again.
Appearance Material: The appearance is stylish. Display effect: The screen resolution is adequate and clear. Thinness: It feels quite substantial; after all, heavier items tend to feel better.
Cooling effect: Just started trying it out, will evaluate later.
The keyboard feels quite nice to type on, and it even came with a mouse and an adapter. Compared to the domestic version, this configuration is quite a bargain. Overall, it's good value for money. As for the machine's performance, I will make an assessment after using it for a while.
The screen is really comfortable!
Using it is very smooth, I will follow up with another review after using it for a while!
Education Information: Beijing reduces the proportion of students with special talents in junior high school admissions in 2016 - Xinhua Net
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination work for junior high school students with special talents entering school in Beijing was organized and implemented by the district education commissions.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the enrollment ratio for students with special talents, making the competition for these students even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, this year the proportion of students with special talents entering middle school from elementary schools in the district will not exceed 5% of the total district enrollment plan, with a planned enrollment of 380 students. The proportion arriving at school will not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
All students who have talents in sports, arts, or technology and have registered online are eligible to participate in the admissions examination for students with special talents.
To facilitate students to participate in the examination nearby, Dongcheng District continues the examination arrangement from last year, setting up 1-2 examination sites in each school district, with a total of 13 examination sites.
Examination venues are divided according to examination areas, and time periods are designated by the hour. On the day of the examination, students will enter the examination venues at their scheduled times and be examined in the examination rooms of different examination areas.
May 23rd, the district education enrollment and examination center will publish the list of students who passed the examination online, and students can check their examination results online.

President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee: Firmly believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics during a special period - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Sarajevo, December 11th - The Chairman of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kvesic, recently expressed that Bosnia is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics with great anticipation and firmly believes that China has the ability to host an excellent Winter Olympic Games during this special period.
Recently, the Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ji Ping, met with the Chairman of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kvesić, at the Sarajevo Olympic Center.
During the meeting, Kvesic spoke highly of Bosnia-China relations and stated that he visited China during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, and was extremely impressed by the excellent organization by the Chinese side. He firmly believes that China has the capability to host a successful Winter Olympic Games during special circumstances. The Bosnian side is greatly looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics, and the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina is actively organizing participation. Bosnia hopes to use this opportunity to engage in more extensive exchanges and cooperation with China in the field of sports.
Ji Ping stated that China and Poland have a special "Olympic bond."
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and in two more months, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also kick off, presenting the world with a simple, safe, and splendid event.
Looking forward to deepening exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the preparation of winter sports events and athletes' training, the Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridging role, taking the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote the continuous deepening of cultural exchanges between the two countries, so that the peoples of both countries can "move towards the future together," and wishing Bosnian and Herzegovinian athletes great success in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete" awards ceremony, where Qi Ping, as a special guest, presented the award to the best young athlete of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
At the event site, promotional videos for the Beijing Winter Olympics were played on a loop.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, setting up "buffer zones" - The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council issues a document requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) — The State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in port cities, requiring that people who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) must hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and those going to land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the requirements mentioned above extends from the date on which each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government determines and announces the scope of port cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions may explore setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
National Health Commission's Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control official stated that for some port cities, cross-border trade is a major economic pillar, with frequent exchanges between border residents on both sides.
Implementing a differentiated management policy by zones, the prevention and control strategy shifts from a single defense line to a double defense line. This is expected to move the checkpoints forward, reducing the risk of epidemic spill-over, and achieving the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimal social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, several local cluster outbreaks have occurred in our country, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas epidemics.
The above notice indicates that there have been issues exposed including untimely monitoring and early warning of the epidemic in some areas, lack of implementation of closed-loop management for personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing being merely a formality, inadequate disinfection of cold-chain items at various stages, non-standard management of centralized quarantine facilities, and emergency response to the epidemic that is not sufficiently scientific and precise.
The notice requires efforts in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanisms of port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the shortcomings in port city defense, and to carry out prevention and control work without letup, scientifically, and precisely, weaving a dense and firm line of defense against external influx.
The notice emphasizes that port cities should simultaneously study and deploy epidemic prevention and control measures alongside livelihood support work, announce and ensure accessible hotlines for livelihood support, regularly inspect potential problems in the supply and pricing of basic living necessities, and promptly resolve and proactively respond to prominent issues raised by the public.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners) with open land, water, and air ports, the cities (prefectures, states, leagues) where they are located, and the municipalities directly under the Central Government. The specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and is announced in a timely manner.

YouTube video exposes the true nature of the U.S. military's 20 years of bloodthirsty killing - Xinhua Net
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a short documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "counter-terrorism," forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war, spending 20 years in wasteful militarism, becoming bloodthirsty, killing innocents indiscriminately, and committing various crimes against humanity.
Abuse of drone strikes on hospitals, schools, and other civilian sites, twisting human nature, establishing murder squads.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up "black sites" to subject "suspects" to various forms of cruel torture and personal humiliation.
Crimes against humanity have sparked even greater hatred among the Afghan people.
Just as the video says, the American "war on terror" becomes "more counterproductive the more it fights."
War has not brought peace, democracy, or hope for prosperity to the people of Afghanistan; what it has brought is a country full of devastation and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video, let's together unveil the truth behind America's bloodthirsty killings in the name of "counter-terrorism", and puncture the hypocritical facade of American-style democracy!
Accidentally came across the following article, which discusses from a business perspective and the point of view of shelf life, why this customer wants the logistics company inside the bonded area to help with canning. Although canning is considered deep processing and not within the business scope of bonded logistics companies, perhaps the following text can explain why the customer would want to do this?
I have been to many milk powder factories and come into contact with numerous milk powder production lines.
Actually, the raw materials for bagged and canned powdered milk are exactly the same, with no difference whatsoever.
So everyone will definitely ask: Why does the bagged product have a shelf life of one year, while the canned product has a shelf life of two years or more?
Or you may ask: Why is there such a big price difference between bottled and bagged versions?
Actually, starting from this point, many consumers or moms believe that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same; it's just that people think what is more expensive is better.
Some consumers, with this mindset, have tried the food and then responded saying that the taste or flavor just isn't the same when it's heard to be packaged!
Now let me first explain to everyone the reason it's considered expensive and where exactly does the cost come from?
Why is there such a big difference in price if their raw materials are the same?
Most manufacturers take into account that if the price of the bagged product is set too high, it would be difficult for consumers to accept it. This means that the profit generated by the manufacturers is very low, or in other words, there is no profit at all. So, what do manufacturers rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have had a significant increase in the pricing of the listening devices to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers primarily promote canned packaging rather than bagged packaging.
Moreover, why are you overthinking the manufacturers' annual advertising expenses, which amount to tens of millions or even hundreds of millions? Where does this money come from?
Everyone can imagine.
As society progresses, the costs of market promotion, such as the expenses for mall promoters, display costs in malls, costs for product giveaways, advertising expenses, and so on, are continuously increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are continuously introducing new products, and they are packaged for listening, with their prices constantly rising. In fact, these new products emerge as a result of increased market expenses.
The primary objective is to achieve higher profits; in fact, the cost increase for their raw materials would not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
Some brands, in order to promote their own products, resort to any means necessary, such as collaborating with hospital doctors to assist in product promotion, earning profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per unit sold.
And the relevant Chinese laws absolutely do not permit such methods of operation, in fact, these practices are harming consumers.
I recommend that everyone purchase bagged milk powder to fill into their own containers at home, provided that they have a can available. This approach can save money and enhance the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, without any adverse effects on young children.
Everyone shouldn't assume that canned products have a longer shelf life than bagged ones. After opening, both canned and bagged products have the same shelf life. It's just that bagged products are less easy to keep and more prone to moisture and spoilage after opening.
The delivery was late, and the food got cold. After it got cold, it became dry and hard, and was completely inedible.
And the soup was also spilled out.
Cancel immediately, the stuff #PRS_ORG# sent over must have gone cold already.

If the order is canceled, can the money be refunded?

No longer willing to wait
Do not scare people away at the starting line - Xinhua News Agency
When wandering through the book market, one can often feel the popularity of self-help books on success.
Many of today's self-help books promote the "Best Principle" —— which is to first assume or imply that you "can do it", and then tell you "what" it is you need to achieve.
It's like suddenly skipping over the "how to do it," which is actually the most important and fundamental step.
Precisely for this reason, all these books share a common characteristic — either go all out to do your best or don't do anything at all; it's either 100 or 0; either you ascend Mount Tai or just stay put where you are.
This "best principle" is something everyone would acknowledge as "absolutely correct," but 99% of people would be intimidated by it right at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you need to make a determined decision, start anew, and make a 180-degree major transformation," which is precisely the fatal weakness for many people.
For those who are set in their ways, cling to old practices and refuse to change, yelling "You need to transform" in their ear is undoubtedly a self-deceptive and futile effort, like playing the lute to a cow.
The vast majority of people show fear in the face of "change", they hesitate, finding it difficult to make a decision; or on the spur of the moment, they make the "change" resolution and bravely take the first step, but often the good times don't last, they can't persist for much longer before they are defeated, lacking sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous comic dialogue "Starting from Tomorrow" is the quintessential portrayal of this "universal human nature."
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority "sigh with admiration at the gate."
Perhaps the "second best principle" is a way that may lead more ordinary people on the path to relative success.
The core of the "Good Enough Principle" lies in "lowering the bar" — it advocates a theory of "accumulating small victories to win big," meaning that if you can't achieve 100, just achieving 1 is also fine: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climbing the small sand dune at your doorstep is fine too, because that's still better than staying in place.
In short, doing something is always better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in barriers, the possibility for ordinary people to persevere has increased, and with perseverance in anything, the likelihood of success also increases.
The path to success that simply follows the "second-best principle" is just slightly longer.
In summary, the "best principle," although ostensibly championed to make everyone successful, in reality, ends up motivating only a minority. In contrast, the "second best principle" is the one that can effectively motivate more people and allow as many as possible to benefit.
Do I need to place the order again now?
The call went unanswered.

Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources increase by 0.71 thousand tons this year - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency Xining December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, which is more than 40 times the amount at the beginning of its protection in 2002.
The naked carp of Qinghai Lake, colloquially known as "Huang Fish", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological chain safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" system in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale human hunting and the deteriorating breeding environment for the naked carp, the population in Qinghai Lake declined sharply. By 2002, the remaining resources of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the naked carp of Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "China Species Red List".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a policy of lake closure for fish cultivation, prohibiting any organizations, collectivities, and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and also prohibits the sale of naked carp and its products.
Meanwhile, through artificial breeding and release as well as cleaning the main river channels that flow into Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages," efforts to protect the resources of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have been continuously increased, with the stock of resources increasing year by year.
Vice Director Yang Lin of the Qinghai Province Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs introduced that, up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp in Qinghai Lake have been artificially reproduced and released, contributing over 23% to the restoration of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Sanjiangyuan region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area for China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake serves as a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the spread of desertification in the west towards the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan region and the Qinghai Lake waters, preserve aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued fishing bans for key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since the beginning of this year, establishing a comprehensive fishing ban management system for "one river, one river, one lake."

It's already been 1 hour, and it still hasn't been delivered.
I just read an article about menstrual periods, it was too long.
Educating the unknowing men.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period sometime during the ages of 13 to 15, and will reach menopause around the age of 50.
Afterwards, assuming good health, it will come regularly once a month.
But it's not so regular that it can be predicted accurately; there's an approximate tolerance of about a week, so preparation in advance is necessary. Sometimes, if luck is bad, things can go awry (suddenly advancing by several days).
The duration of the period, blood volume, and severity of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some experience it for three days, others for a week; some have light flow while others may have heavy bleeding. Some feel little to no discomfort, whereas others may have pain so severe that they require an ambulance. The experience of dysmenorrhea can change over time - the absence of pain in the past does not guarantee a lifetime free from pain.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, with bleeding 24 hours a day for the several days from start to finish, and all that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood to prevent it from getting onto clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen promptly at the onset of the menstrual period before the pain starts can effectively alleviate the pain for that month. It is not very useful to take it after the pain has already started.
Before menstruation, due to the congestion of the uterus and the excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to experience diarrhea.
If you suddenly experience diarrhea when your period is about to start, your menstruation will generally begin within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two to three hours, otherwise it is easy for bacteria to breed. Excluding sleep time, the worst-case scenario is changing pads six times a day, for seven days a month, which totals 42 pads. If you include the extra pads prepared in advance, there might be about 50 pads. It is not the case that only one pad is used each month.
(Here's a revision, sanitary tampons don't need to be changed frequently, about every five to six hours is sufficient, with the maximum being eight hours.)
Hormones during menstruation can cause irritability, and the ovulation period can also bring emotional instability due to changes in hormones within the body. It's quite unfortunate when your body trips you up like that.
But official crime rate data indicate that women still have a high ability to control their emotions and do not use emotional issues as an excuse.
Not only blood flows, but also the shed endometrium.
After menstruation, the endometrium is at its thinnest and gradually thickens. This can be understood as the uterus being a house, where each month the house (endometrium thickens) is prepared to welcome a guest. If the guest doesn't arrive, everything is taken down (menstrual shedding), and a new house is built the following month, in a recurring cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for several decades, a few days each month with 24 hours of bleeding, along with stomach and back pain, who would want that?
But a person is born because their mother has menstruated, and menstruation prepares the womb where you will live for the first 10 months when you come into this world. Everyone should be thankful for their mother's regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many aspects of women's lives were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into thinking they were dirty and shameful. Everyone assumed that was just how things were, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting, finding the female body's preparations for nurturing life repulsive, they shouldn't express such thoughts in public. Girls, stand up; don't think this way anymore. Men who have never and will never experience this, and don't understand it very well, should not be so ungrateful and insensitive. How can they face their own mothers with such an attitude, or even consider having their own children?
Finally, sisters, try using tampons, they are really handy.
Today is the Winter Solstice festival, delivering the wrong gift is rather disappointing.

Is the numbness in my feet caused by the foot bath being electrified?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a very good effect on foot therapy and health care. Today, the Guomei editor will answer this question, hoping to be helpful to friends.
With the increase in people's health awareness, footbath basins are becoming more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market. From footbaths costing more than a hundred yuan to those costing thousands of yuan, there is a dazzling array, giving consumers a great deal of choice.
In the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of health care appliances such as foot baths are booming. However, foot baths do not have specific industry standards, so there are certain safety risks.
"Soaking feet in electrified water is really too dangerous!"
Mr. Li told the reporter that he recently bought a foot bath as a birthday present for his father, but his father felt a tingling sensation in his feet while soaking them.
Mr. Li initially thought that the vibration function of the foot bath was causing it, but unexpectedly, even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tested with a voltage pen and to his surprise, it lit up, indicating that the water in the foot bath was actually electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant had a pretty good attitude. Despite having returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt displeased.
Because he found that the long-popular footbath has no clear and detailed industry regulations regarding its highest temperature setting, the target audience it is suitable for, and the materials ensuring it is harmless.
Under normal circumstances, foot baths do not have electrical issues, but it cannot be ruled out that a small number of products are not strictly checked when leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose a split-type footbath when purchasing.
Electricity and water are separated, there is no safety hazard.
You can also casually use a test pen to measure.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Online - Hua Sheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10th (All Media Reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, Correspondent Liu Xiaoling, Photographer Li Jian) - This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference were held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture, and accelerate towards the goal of achieving a hundred-billion-yuan tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, Vice-Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
Chinese Academy of Engineering Academician Professor Liu Zhonghua heavily promoted at the opening ceremony: The origin of Lake Red is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new vitality into the "colorful Hunan tea."
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, advanced the construction of the hundred-billion yuan Xiang tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "three Xiang regions, four waters, and colorful tea".
The tea industry within the province is increasing innovation, with main types of tea such as green tea, dark tea, and black tea taking turns to exert their strengths. The major tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, driving a substantial increase in income for numerous tea farmers.
The wheel of fortune turns, and black tea gains momentum again.
Experts within the provincial tea industry say that by harvesting green tea, then red and black teas, tea farmers have income throughout the four seasons, and the productivity of tea plantations has surged.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders presented the award to enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark in the fourth batch, with Xinhua happily bearing the title of "Source of Hunan Red".
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, a Fujian tea merchant took a liking to a high-altitude tea named "Bing Li Chun" and placed an order on the spot.
Wang Zhun, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that although the current pandemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, the Tea Expo is full of highlights.
Xinhua black tea is a touch of red, infused with the cultural connotations of tea, enjoying great popularity and brisk trade, heralding a new spring for the Hunan tea industry.

Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be directly answered through perception by means of rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aimed at explaining the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese term "形而上学" is derived from the phrase "形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器" in the "Commentary on the Attached Phrases" of the I Ching, and was translated by the Japanese scholar Inoue Tetsujiro (from the Meiji era) from the word "metaphysics".
Metaphysics branches include ontology, natural theology, and its extended issues, etc.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism, which denies the existence of God.
The theoretical foundation posits that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and the theory of evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to the research method that does not mention God.
Philosophical psychology is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing "the relationship between the mind and the body".
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline that systematically thinks about and researches human moral life; here, morality is defined as all behavioral norms recognized by a group of people or a culture.
Metaphysics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theory or critical nature), normative ethics (evaluating various moral views, and providing recommendations for moral standards regarding right or wrong actions).
It explores what kind of moral conduct codes people should observe, applied ethics (the academic study of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (gathering information about how people live and making generalizations from the observed patterns).
It examines ethics not from the perspective of anticipated theories but investigates the actual choices made by moral agents and observed, as well as all the moral factors that brought about these decisions. It studies the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, and medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: The ethical thought of humanism, represented by people like Valla and Montaigne.
Part Two: The Ethical Thoughts of the Reformation, Represented by Calvin.
Part Three: The Ethics of Politics, represented by thinkers such as Machiavelli, modern ethics (17th-18th century British Empiricism Ethics, with key figures like Hume; 17th-18th century Continental Rationalism Ethics, with philosophers like Spinoza; 18th century French Enlightenment Ethics, with figures such as Voltaire; 18th-19th century German Idealism Ethics, with Kant and Hegel among others; 18th-19th century British Utilitarian Ethics, with Bentham and Sidgwick, etc.; 19th century British Evolutionary Ethics, with representatives like Spencer and Huxley; late 19th century German Neo-Kantian Ethics, with figures like Rickert; late 19th century Neo-Hegelian Ethics, with philosophers like Thomas Hill Green, etc.), and the transitional period ethics (Non-Rationalism Ethics, with key figures like Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, etc.).

Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all friends for the humanitarian aid that you have provided over more than 30 years since our loved one's disaster. Especially since the beginning of 1994, when I personally issued a plea for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad, the aid has continued without interruption to this day.
Most of the victims' elderly parents have now passed away, and the orphans have also grown up and started their own families and careers.
Your acts of righteousness have helped our afflicted families through the most difficult moments.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc across the globe, and most donors have already reached retirement age.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you cease your humanitarian donations to our troubled group—Tiananmen Mothers. This humanitarian aid activity should have already come to a perfect end.
I will forever remember your kindness, and firmly believe that your righteous acts will be remembered by history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand, my friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Please allow me to take this opportunity to offer a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid work undertaken by the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars in USA (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, with frequent crossover among the implementers of their projects.

Financial aid often cannot be successfully delivered to the hands of the families affected by the June Fourth Incident.
In 1994, on the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was formed by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and take charge of receiving and distributing humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund," which, after being executed for 11 years, was succeeded by the creation of the "June 4th Impoverished Elderly Assistance Fund" in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans had graduated from college. The fund has been in operation ever since.
These projects are primarily funded by campus and social donations from the year of June Fourth, generous contributions from individuals, and are supported by the Brother Universities Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Laogai Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the families of the June Fourth victims finally received a portion of the donations that were collected in Hong Kong in the name of the June Fourth incident.
During this period, "China Human Rights" was also independently carrying out their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called a halt to the June Fourth donations out of consideration for the donors, who are indeed all retired elderly with incomes not as ample as before retirement. We hereby express our gratitude for Mr. Ding's "Letter to Friends."
We will respect the decisions of the family members and terminate the project within two years, resuming immediately when necessary.
For those who have persisted over the years in generously donating and taking risks to deliver humanitarian aid, we express our gratitude and respect to all those gallant souls.

Thank you very much for choosing our product. Before using our chip, please take 5 minutes to carefully read the following:
After opening the box, please check whether the goods are complete.
If there is any omission, please contact customer service in time.
The cover plate on the microfluidic chip is made of PC material, please do not introduce solvents that will react chemically with PC.
Do not use a manual syringe to directly sample the chip, as this can easily cause leakage.
Microfluidic chips with common substrates are all tested with pure water under an injection pressure of 500 mbar (for a channel depth of 100 µm) or 300 mbar (for a channel depth of 50 µm) before shipment.
Chips with a glass base are tested with pure water under a sample pressure of 800 mbar (100um channel) before shipping. Please be careful not to collide the glass base chips with sharp objects during use, as this will damage the base.
During use, please consider the viscosity of the solution and do not exceed this range, otherwise it will cause leakage.
Under the condition of using pure water injections with an ordinary base microfluidic microchip and an injection pump, we suggest setting the flow rate below 150ul/min, and the oil phase flow rate is recommended to be set below 50ul/min.
Please increase your flow rate parameter values from slow to fast, taking into consideration the actual viscosity of the sample liquid.
After the experiment is completed with the universal chip, please clean the internal channels in a timely manner, otherwise it may easily cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be reused for an extended period.
If the chip is damaged due to prolonged use or improper operation, it is not eligible for return or exchange.

Thank you for the rabbit's comments. I originally said no to the antique style because it didn't suit, but I never expected the finished product to turn out so beautiful.
Thank you for Dan Dan's recognition, your satisfaction energizes us to keep moving forward, we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really amazing. I highly recommend all my friends to come!
Every aspect from reception, makeup, attire, lighting, photography to post-production is flawless.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous and will match a makeup look that suits your style, with all cosmetics used being top-tier famous brands.
There's even no need to mention Teacher Tian Liang; his photography is really quite professional.
The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are also two kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better photo studios in Beijing all require queuing up six months in advance. A colleague had photos taken in Beijing and after looking at the finished product, felt they were just so so.
I specially sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is not very good, and we feel that this is a shortcoming for most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record naturally wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a skilled team.
The finished product received endless praise from us and the people around us.
I have already recommended it to my bestie, and she was also overjoyed after just seeing the proof.
I hope such studios won't be overlooked, that more people will discover it and create their own unique style, instead of being all the same.
Thank you very much to Zhan Ying and Jing Ling for the five-star review. Both of you are very thoughtful and creative newcomers. We are a creative studio, and as long as the customer likes it, we will put in 200% effort to accomplish it. Grateful for the acquaintance and meeting.
A sweet and considerate assistant, along with a lively and cheerful photography teacher, every member of the team is super nice. It was a wonderful photoshoot, an unforgettable experience, and the results turned out much better than I expected. Everyone worked hard, and I'm very grateful to all of you 😘😘
Thank you, Xiaoyu, for the review. Meeting you all is also a kind of destiny. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust in us is as long as the journey of several thousand kilometers. I am very happy to have met you. If you get the chance, come visit Qinhuangdao again next time.
How should I pay?

A programming newbie who wants to share personal experiences.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have such an intention, it's better to learn by yourself. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it also requires six months of learning time.
But if you're planning on getting into this industry, training is indeed a very good option, especially for those with very weak self-discipline, training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to study by yourself, although it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important matter.
First, it is necessary to look at the teaching resources of the institution; if the teaching strength is not strong enough, then the training organization does not hold much significance. Of course, the teaching resources of some newly established training organizations are not particularly strong.
Before choosing, investigate the training institution and, if possible, inquire about the students who have graduated from it. After all, only the students from the institution can truly know what it's like and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't given an introduction to your own circumstances, and learning this thing is greatly related to one's own personal situation.
For example, your major, age, language you wish to learn, or even which city you're in, all these factors are relevant to the industry you are studying for or looking to pursue a career in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you have already graduated with a degree in computer science, I personally suggest self-study if you have sufficient time. It is the most efficient and cost-effective method. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are actually quite good, but they are costly to attend and require a significant time investment, typically requiring 3-6 months of focused training.
But if it's as per the situations I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Now, many learning resources on the internet are free, or you can also find numerous training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know how to find resources, you can contact me through the bio to get free resources, or even for a detailed consultation.
Additionally, there are some classic books that can be used in conjunction with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer science major, but you are willing to invest a certain amount of money and time in learning, then it is recommended to attend training institutions. This way, learning is not very strenuous, the teachers explain the details thoroughly, there are people to answer questions specifically, and there is also help with learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now will sign employment agreements and have internal referral quotas. After completing the training, they recommend candidates to companies, which can save a lot of trouble during the job interview process later on.
Here are some of my thoughts. Since I don't know your situation, the introduction I gave earlier was only general and not very detailed. If you have any other questions or issues you'd like to consult on, please feel free to contact me for discussion and communication.
I said I would arrive before 1 o'clock; I saw it on the App.
What does it mean
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I undertake all types of (installation, cleaning, maintenance) services for wall-mounted boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, light fixture installations, window cleaning, professional caulking, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who silently give me likes, to those striving hard for life; life is tiring, but we must carry on.
Life will not let down everyone who tries hard, if you like, please follow me, thanks to those who silently give me likes.
Life is like this, others only see the results, you alone bear the process. In the face of life, apart from being strong, we can only continue; there are no other options. The road can be looked back upon, but cannot be retraced...
Housekeeping is a job and also a responsibility. Life is made beautiful by service, and service is made excellent by dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work in cleaning services, we will clean every nook and cranny of the customer's home with the most earnest attitude. Seeing the satisfied smiles of the customers and their thumbs up, at that moment, all the tiredness is worth it. There is always a reward for our efforts!
My daily work
Your requirement, my service.
Serve wholeheartedly, clean with care, preserve the beauty.
The attention to detail you care about, Fungui Housekeeping helps you achieve the "ultimate" cleanliness, serving the home with love.
Keeping thousands of homes clean, setting up a monument for household management, service in place, cleanliness to your home.
Indoor and Outdoor Cleaning, My Daily Work
Although crystal chandeliers are gorgeous, they can become dull and lackluster if not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they shine brightly. The same is true for life.
Success comes from dedication, and meticulousness shapes refinement. We take tile grouting seriously.
Give me a chance, I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for everything, because professionalism is worthy of trust. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
Every industry is tough nowadays!
But I have always believed that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough perseverance, and enough effort, I will be a little better than others, at the very least it's better than just sitting and complaining!
The plan of a day is in the morning, and all that is beautiful starts with the dawn. I hope you start the new day with happiness, luck, health, and satisfaction and maintain a good mood all day long. Good morning.
As a child, happiness was an object; possessing it meant happiness. As an adult, happiness became a goal; achieving it meant happiness. Upon maturity, it was discovered that happiness was actually a state of mind; comprehending it meant happiness.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, act according to your heart, and live without regrets; there is one path in life, walk your own; there are two treasures in life: good health and good mood, live beautifully until old age!
Every stage of life presents its own set of challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face things positively.
Since it's impossible to avoid, it's better to face it calmly.
The more you fear, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you face challenges head-on, problems will eventually be solved with ease.
Chinese and Saudi curators join hands to hold the first Saudi contemporary art biennale - Xinhua-net
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12th (reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) — The inaugural Saudi Arabian Contemporary Art Biennale — Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District, northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other places are participating in the exhibition.
This Biennale is co-curated by the Diriyah Biennale Foundation of Saudi Arabia and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art of China, with Tian Feiyu, the curator of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art of China, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this Biennale is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones," which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of socio-economic transition, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi society and cultural development.
The Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, presenting six sections: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones," "Tradition as Experiment," "Marginal Thinking," "Engaging the Public," "Brave New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among them, works by 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total exhibits, encompassing various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; artworks by 12 Chinese artists also receive considerable attention, with some artists creating in novel ways using recycled materials. For example, Xu Bing in "A Story Behind: Endless Streams and Mountains" (2014) reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
The CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, Buckley, stated that they hope this Biennale will establish international dialogues, allowing global audiences to have the opportunity to understand the thriving cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and to enhance interactive exchanges.
Tian Feiyu said, "The Biennale's goal is twofold: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue and to enable Saudi audiences to integrate into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the Biennale opening period, where artists, curators, and opinion leaders from the creative industries will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Standardizing the Management of Public Welfare Positions in Rural Areas - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) - To continue providing employment assistance to people lifted out of poverty and to consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently introduced policies related to the management of public welfare positions in rural revitalization, aiding the comprehensive advancement of rural revitalization.
The relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare positions, which are used to settle employment for groups such as the labor force that has been lifted out of poverty and other rural disadvantaged groups. These positions play an important role in helping the poverty-stricken population achieve employment and increase income, consolidate the achievements of the poverty alleviation campaign, and effectively improve the capabilities of various public services in rural areas.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments including the Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, Finance, etc., and mainly standardize aspects such as the scope of candidates for recruitment of public welfare positions in rural areas, fund management, position development, and position management.
In terms of job development and allocation, the new regulations clarify that positions should be established based on the principles of "establishing positions as needed, assigning people to positions accordingly, managing dynamically, and controlling the overall number," "those who develop are those who use and are responsible," and "one person per position, voluntary disclosure, and unified management."
The recruitment process must be carried out in steps including announcement, application, review, public display, employment, pre-job training, and job assignment.
Additionally, the new regulations have clarified the specific responsibilities of the main departments responsible for developing rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and methods for rural public welfare positions, and stipulate that each department responsible for developing rural public welfare positions should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for those placed in rural public welfare positions; it also requires relevant departments to regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare positions.

Hello
Can the order be cancelled?
I've placed the order again.
Has it been cancelled?
II. Although the rightists have had their heyday in history, it was always brief. The reason why it was short is that they flourish at the slightest exposure to sunlight and start to sweat with a sip of boiled water; they become greedy with a little success, longing for more, and when struck, they quickly become disheartened and lose their momentum.
But to be realistic, the right wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the rightists should not be denied in aspects such as setting the standard for truth after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy and enhancing technology, as well as promoting institutionalization of the political system and the protection of human rights.
III. As for me, although I do not entirely agree with some of the views expressed by Li Weidong, I take his words seriously and have great respect for Li Weidong as a person. He is earnest, serious about China, and takes a serious view of China's social issues.
But I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that if revolutions are deemed necessary, they will inevitably lead to social unrest, harming the welfare of the people. Political groups will become a jumbled mess where the good cannot be distinguished from the bad. Additionally, foreign powers may take advantage of the ensuing chaos.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and its people. Political opportunists trying to pull chestnuts out of the fire are not rightists; they are scoundrels.
Let's talk more about Zuo.
Left behind, they are actually the forsaken children of their era and politics.
If it is said that the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when necessary. In that case, the left doesn't have such good fortune, because what the left seeks is precisely the dregs that the Communist Party has discarded!
V. Recently I've seen some friends getting quite worked up while arguing against dissidents and refuting extreme leftists. I think there's really no need for that.
Don't try to reason with traitors or radical leftists; they are all stubborn and beyond reason.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about making the dissidents and the left-crazed admit it. Why bother?
I tell my friends this: When the dissidents call you a wumao, and when the left-wing crazies call you a rightist dog, it just proves that our middle path is the correct one!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they grow old, they either forget their ideals or pursue them to the point of becoming fanatical.
As we drift further from our ideals, even the young dragon slayer can turn into the very dragon he once sought to defeat.
Control and freedom are generally what I think "left and right" refer to, and due to the innate genetic predispositions of historical and cultural origins, China as a whole should lean to the left.
Domestically, the right-wing liberals focus on efficiency and development, while the left-wing emphasizes stronger regulation and gives greater importance to fairness and security.
Nowadays society generally hopes to place more emphasis on fairness, and with China and the US in conflict, a tilt to the left is certain, which is expected to continue for many years.
Although I don't understand it, giving a like will do.
No need to say anything more, Huahua is just that righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and encirclement of Huawei's chips have not only put Huawei in an unprecedented dilemma but also caused huge losses to "American-affiliated" companies.
The United States is suppressing China's chip industry, demanding that its own companies and those of its allied countries also blockade China's chip industry. The direct consequence of this is that global chip suppliers’ orders and profits are affected, leading to reduced R&D investment and decreased production capacity among chip manufacturing enterprises. This has caused a shortage and disruption within the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected major industries worldwide, such as car companies halting production and mobile phone price increases. Almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected by it.
To gain autonomy over "chips," an increasing number of tech giants from various countries are starting to take the path of "de-Americanization."
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor rights and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, recently the US has been very active. They hosted a "Chip summit" and invited giants from 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, while also providing funds to support US domestic technology giants. For instance, the American traditional tech giant Intel, in an effort to reclaim its leading position in the chip sector, has invested 20 billion US dollars to build two chip fabrication plants in Arizona and has opened its chip foundry services to external clients.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is very likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason for such confidence is that Intel, as an established tech giant of the United States, has been deeply rooted in the semiconductor field for decades, possessing a vast pool of talent and technical reserves, and is bound to rise quickly in the short term to defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Morris Chang expressed disdain for Intel's decision.
During the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Morris Chang made a surprising statement. Unreservedly, he commented on Intel's investment in constructing a semiconductor foundry: It is quite ironic that Intel is building a chip foundry.
Morris Chang's disdain for Intel's foray into the semiconductor wafer field is due to the fact that Chang still harbors a grudge from a dispute between TSMC and Intel that took place over 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel of American manufacturing, occupying the pinnacle of the global stage and the dominant force in the world semiconductor field.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were always controlled by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured, and packaged by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model places an unbearable burden on some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only look on helplessly in the face of the huge costs of production line construction.
Under the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to see the emergence of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, upon hearing that there were companies specializing in chip design, Morris Chang believed that if there were companies dedicated to design, then it was possible to establish a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Not long after, Morris Chang's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into existence.
TSMC has focused its main business on the single segment of "wafer processing," not engaging in design, only providing foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At the time, the newly founded TSMC was but a minor player in front of the behemoth Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but at that time, as soon as Intel heard that TSMC was only involved in the manufacturing sector of the chip industry, they evidently thought too highly of themselves and looked down on TSMC, decisively rejecting any investment in TSMC.
Morris Chang also recognized that Intel was looking down on wafer fabrication services at the time.
The giants who once looked down on wafer fabrication services are now beginning to engage in wafer foundry themselves.
So, Zhang Zhongmou finds it ironic that Intel is entering the foundry business.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed Intel.
Facing TSMC's aggressive offensive, Intel naturally does not dare to remain complacent.
Today, TSMC is advancing towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at the 14nm technology from 7 years ago.
Surpassing is actually not an easy task.
Can't wait anymore
It's been 2 hours since the order was placed at 19:06 😅
Today, let's take a look at some [weird trending searches].
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly picked three hot searches: Longtaitou Festival on the second day of the second lunar month, Haitai's price increase, and the Huolala incident. Public opinion spread to form a wave peak, then the "index decreased" (smoothed curve) and finally dissipated. If secondary public opinion is generated, there would be a small hump appearing again.
They look no different from the "Online Public Opinion Evolution Model" that was once displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is an abnormal public sentiment?
Randomly selected six hot searches in the same event, presenting a 【lone peak】, 【serrated】, 【cliff-like】 appearance.
[Solitary Peak Pattern] refers to artificially heating up, rapidly surging to the top of trending searches, thereby causing public attention; [Sawtooth Pattern] refers to periodically heating up to ensure that the topic occupies the hot search list; [Cliff Pattern] refers to a collective withdrawal after the hot search has served its "function," ready to receive new orders and charge towards a new battlefield.
In figure 9, the peak of the heat for one event coincides precisely with the trough of another event, down to the exact minute and second. This must be a unified batch of paid internet commenters receiving their orders to launch a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches rank simultaneously, some attract attention, some are responsible for educating the public, some instigate and create momentum for conflicts, some divert attention, some influence perception, some mislead judgment, some incite emotions, and some coerce decision-making. Black industry accounts operate in batches and at different nodes with precision, taking into account almost all elements involved in the spread of public opinion.
Propaganda is a science; by setting aside positions, emotions, and all subjective factors, and considering only the objective data, even negative PR tactics cannot hide.
Wherever one goes, one inevitably leaves traces; let us dig out such traces together.

Mauritius and other countries report first cases of infection with the Omicron variant - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 - According to reports from Xinhua correspondents abroad, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported their first cases of infection with the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron.
Mauritius reported for the first time on the 10th that there were two Omicron strain infection cases in the country.
According to Mauritius Health Minister Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27th after departing from South Africa; the other infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for the virus on November 30th after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of these two infected persons turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed its first three cases of Omicron variant infections.
These three individuals are all students who returned from abroad at the beginning of this month. Since all of them had mild symptoms, they were not admitted to the hospital for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Seychelles government continues to intensify its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th of the following year, passengers over the age of 12 entering by plane are required to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
Seychelles' Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
On the 9th, Malawi's Minister of Health, Khumbize Chiponda, announced the country's first three cases of infection with the Omicron variant.
The country's health department carried out genomic sequencing on 12 COVID-positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, identifying these 3 cases of infection.

At first, a friend recommended it because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look. Initially, my budget was 70,000 for basic renovations.
Once they come into the store, a series of deception begins.
I visited the store for the first time just to show them the floor plan of my apartment. They didn't actually go to measure the house in person. Surprisingly, they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000. They showed me some of their materials, but I don't even know what brands they are.
Their second trick is that once you are in the store, they will drag you into paying the deposit (and once this money is paid, you will never get it back unless you have enough experience to engage in a battle of wits with them).
I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not when they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you a certain discount.
This is simply a big trap; I am a living example of being scammed, paying a deposit of over ten thousand in a moment of impulse.
The quote he gave me has many issues: 70,000 does not include plumbing and electrical renovations, nor does it include any doors and cabinets, or the bathroom, and these three are the major costs of the basic installation.
Apart from these, the service point fees they charge are also higher than those of other companies.
I have lost trust in this company; they had me sign the contract without clarifying everything at the beginning.
When I went to ask for a refund, they acted very experienced and had a special small team to deal with you.
No matter what, they will firmly insist that it is the customer's problem, and they are completely blameless.
Various shirking of responsibilities, and there are many details that I don't want to enumerate as it brings tears to my eyes. In short, do not choose them because the house my friend had renovated by them is also of poor quality, and they'll add up all sorts of costs for you later on.
Pitiful, they are just the original deceitful leading decoration company, now changed to Da Mei, seems like they've gone bankrupt again and transformed into something else.
So everyone should avoid choosing such a rip-off decoration company.
In the future, everyone should do more Baidu searches and consult on these matters when making choices because renovation is not a small expense.
If you want to ask the merchant a question, please log in or register first.
It is strictly forbidden to publish reviews of merchants in any form. For details, please refer to the Merchant Inclusion Statement.
The Dianping Kunming decoration design channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of DaMei 360 Integrated Home Decoration. If you're looking for a decoration company, just go to Dianping.
If it's so scary and can't be delivered within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Isn't there any other way? Like, changing the address?
Sure, then don't cancel this conversation. If you haven't refunded me within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
Can I cancel if it's less than 15 minutes?
The mouthwatering chicken should have been cooked, but what was received was raw meat, which was inedible.
Starry Sky Appointment | The Geminid meteor shower welcomes its peak on the 14th - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter: Zhou Runjian) — Astronomical popular science experts introduced that as the last major meteor shower of this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who enjoy meteor showers can observe it in the latter half of the night on that day.
On December 13, 2018, Beijing astronomy enthusiast An Jiu captured the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers have periodic comets as their parent bodies, but the Geminid meteor shower's parent body is the 3200 Phaethon asteroid, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also currently known as the second meteor shower not "birthed" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director and astronomy outreach expert Xiuliping explained that, just like blockbuster New Year films, the Geminids meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, with the "showing period" lasting from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady rate, and together with the Quadrantids and the Perseids, it is referred to as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteors have relatively slow velocities and rich colors, with quite a few fireballs. It is suitable for both visual observation and for beginners in astrophotography to capture.
Tianjin-based astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing captured the Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin, on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts indicate that this year's Geminid meteor shower will reach its maximum around 15:00 on December 14th, with a Zenithal Hourly Rate (ZHR) of 150 under ideal observation conditions, where the radiant is directly overhead.
Gemini meteor shower recommendation index chart.
Last year, the 'Geminid Meteor Shower' dazzled many with its impressive display, but this year's Geminids will be somewhat diminished in spectacle due to interference from the moonlight.
November 14th is the 11th day of the 11th lunar month, the phase of the moon is a waxing gibbous, and the bright moonlight will interfere with observations. Fortunately, the moon will set in the latter part of the night, and at this time the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe during the few hours after the moon sets in the latter part of the night, but be sure to keep warm to prevent the cold.
How can one observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to make observations in the city. You can choose a place in the suburbs or countryside with high altitude, minimal light pollution, and an open view facing the northeast direction. Then wait patiently until after the moon sets, and you can observe with the naked eye.
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large number of meteors moving in all directions, so it is not necessary to keep staring at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography and want to capture splendid 'meteor shower blockbusters' should choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens, and use a high ISO and the maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on considerations of stability and sustainability, a tripod, spare batteries, and a shutter release cable are also essential.
Xiuli Peng reminds.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
Based on my understanding, when the author refers to traditional TV, they are most likely talking about LCD TVs. The key differences in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs mainly include the following two points:
Firstly, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the widespread market positioning of liquid crystal televisions, laser TVs are clearly more focused on the large-screen market, or it can be said that laser TVs are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream sizes for LCD TVs range from 55 to 65 inches, while laser TVs generally start at 75 inches and above, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large-screen color televisions.
In recent years, the global shipment and sales volume share of laser TVs have been continuously increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total sales volume of TVs 80 inches and above.
According to CMM's forecast, in 2020, the laser TV market sales volume will grow by more than 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason for such good results in the big screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not shine directly into the eyeball. Compared with the backlight illumination of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the process of object imaging under natural conditions, which also produces less stimulation to the eyes.
China Electronics Standardization Institute's Cesi Laboratory and ophthalmology experts from Peking Union Medical College Hospital, through rigorous comparative experiments of viewing laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions among the population, have obtained 144 sets of test data.
The data confirms that laser TV indeed possesses strong eye-protection features, and in certain aspects, it even has a certain improvement effect.
In an era where vision health is increasingly valued, laser TVs have attracted more and more users with their eye-protection advantages and have also opened another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the prices are gradually climbing.
What justifies the high price of laser TV?
It must make sense.
Under the continuous development of light sources and technological levels, laser TVs have many advantages that neither LCD TVs nor projectors can achieve.
Using ultra-short-throw projection technology, laser TVs can project over much shorter distances compared to traditional projection devices, enabling a 100-inch large-screen experience within a short distance. The space required is minimal, and the main unit is compact, taking up very little space.
In terms of brightness, major brand laser TVs can achieve a brightness of over 2000 lumens.
Additionally, it generates less heat, causes less wear and tear on equipment, and also extends the television's lifespan.
Additionally, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with genuine 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens, and numerous other cutting-edge technologies, capable of delivering a more stunning audio-visual experience to users.
It's not about false needs, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and cost-performance ratio, laser TV isn't the choice of audiophiles and cinephiles. Trying it might be an option for those wanting both a large screen and adaptability to less-than-ideal viewing environments. Everything has its pros and cons; weigh them and then judge for yourself. Just be wary of taking advice from a single source.
Simply put, the ultra-short-throw projector—a laser TV—has to engage expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors in order to be close to the screen, which is not in line with optimal optical design.
To shield some ambient light, a microstructured Fresnel screen is used, which is quite costly—the price of an 80-inch one could essentially buy a 65-inch LCD.
One more thing, I particularly dislike when projector manufacturers use the "diffuse reflection is better for the eyes" angle as a selling point. Please, the light that the eyes can see on the screen is direct light to the eyes, whether you diffuse it onto the ceiling or not. If you're going to get technical, LCD TVs also emit "diffuse direct" light—turn on the TV and doesn't it also illuminate the ceiling?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it simply cannot form an image.
The hot spot (bright spot) effect of the high gain screen, which has been overlooked, is truly uncomfortable when a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery - A Selected Quality Shop, Currently No Branches Available
After adding WeChat to make an appointment, the lady sent me the available slots, and she replies fairly promptly~
Before going, I checked out the photo shoots from the store, which were mostly outdoor wedding dresses. They were beautifully shot and involved a variety of shooting styles.
After arriving that day, I had a simple conversation with the young lady about my thoughts. She was very patient and helped me try on two sets of clothes in styles I was agonizing over. Finally, we settled on starting with the makeup and styling. Before taking photos, the photographer would arrange some props and guide the poses, also striving for perfection in every detail.
However, it might be because there was no specific discussion with me about the shooting concepts, so the result isn't quite the style I wanted, but it should still be visually appealing. 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help choose the photos and discuss the post-processing style, which feels quite attentive.
The repaired film will take about half a month; just wait for the result.
I won a free portrait photography session for the second time – I could choose one outfit from most of the clothes available for the shoot.
Finally chose a black gauze skirt to experience a different style.
The entire shooting process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of the shoot is a post-95s younger brother. He still feels a bit green, hoping that he can provide more guidance on customers' pose instructions in the future. He's quite talkative, and the shooting process was quite pleasant.

Featured on the homepage, come take a look at Queenie too~
Upon arrival, you'll need to fill in your name and phone number before choosing outfits. You can even select wedding dresses. I changed into three or four different outfits, and they were quite patient. After making a choice, the makeup took quite some time, but the service attitude was good. For the photo shoot, they'll instruct you on how to pose. It's just that the photos make my face look so big. They said retouching would take half a month, but I received them in just three or four days. It feels like there’s not much difference from the original shots.
[Environment] Overall, it's still good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are about three makeup spots, inside is a photography studio.
[Service] is enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylist is quite patient.
The photographer will also teach you poses seriously.
If not satisfied, the photographer will also actively suggest a reshoot.
Experience: The styling might have been a bit overdone, as the original double eyelids turned into triple eyelids.
The tails of the eyebrows have also been shaved, which is a bit awkward for someone who doesn't normally draw their eyebrows.
The photo was given about ten days ago, but I am not very satisfied with the Photoshop effects; the double eyelid stickers are still quite noticeable.
Because I was not sure what style I wanted, I tried on two sets. After much deliberation, I still chose the black dress. The lady said that this set had a more Audrey Hepburn vintage vibe.
After choosing the clothes, I started to get my hair and makeup done. The hairstylist and the makeup artist were both super patient in helping me, and I'm very satisfied with the results.
After getting my makeup and hair done, I started taking photos. The photographer directed me on how to pose throughout the shoot, and the process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After the shoot, I carefully chose four favorite photos for retouching. The young gentleman said they would be ready within 15 days. I'm very satisfied with the outcome.
I haven't received a reply for 3 days... Due to your system not being able to recognize my credit card, I am unable to sign up for the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that every time I make a payment, I use the same credit card.
I have to pay for shipping every time now.
Can I be exempted first and then you charge my monthly fee after your investigation is complete? Is that okay?
Is it reliable for a small umbrella to buy insurance?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
Based on the setup conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Agencies (Revised in 2015)," to become an insurance brokerage company, one must meet three key criteria: shareholders, initiators with no serious violations of the law in the recent three years, and a minimum capital requirement of RMB 50 million to establish. It must also be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three criteria are actually quite stringent, summed up as requiring strength, approval from the national authority, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks within the country), and shareholders with a good code of conduct. As for Xiaoyusan Insurance, an insurance brokerage firm, policyholders need not overly question whether Xiaoyusan Insurance is legitimate or not, given these three thresholds, which not every insurance company can meet.
At this point, it's not bad and is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Xiaoyusan Insurance is an insurance supermarket where many companies' star critical illness policies are sold on this platform, such as the newly listed Hetai Super Mary No. 5 critical illness insurance. Both the claims and underwriting are handled by Hetai Life Insurance; Xiaoyusan Insurance is merely a third-party intermediary, so there's no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment models: Internet platform products, due to the absence of operating costs for physical sales outlets and the cost of sales staff salaries, generally offer a higher cost-performance ratio. Moreover, the payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payments to alleviate the insured's payment pressure while maximizing the leverage of insurance.
This aspect is still very good.
It's worth considering.
From the perspective of professional competence in sales: This point is particularly important because insurance is an industry that requires a high level of expertise. Many internet-based insurance products allow customers to insure themselves, and this can lead to many misconceptions. In areas such as health disclosure and profession, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective beliefs when insuring, thinking they are healthy or eligible. This can easily lead to many hidden risks in claims and the possibility of claim denial.
I have personally worked in telesales for insurance at "Tencent Weibao" (like Xiaoyusan, it's also an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I can tell everyone very responsibly.
Internet insurance is real and reliable; what's unreliable are people. There are no professional practitioners in internet channels, and there is a lot of misleading sales information.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covering 6 million, getting a phone with insurance purchase, free 60,000 critical illness coverage - these marketing strategies are not wrong in themselves, but they avoid the main issue and are lightweight. They will not inform the policyholder that although the first month is 1 yuan, the subsequent months will be charged at the normal rate, which varies from tens to 200 yuan. Many customers have deductions for one or two years without a clear understanding of what they have purchased.
Thought you could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would compensate 6 million (like a pie falling from the sky).
Free cell phones are given to insurance policies with special policy numbers, such as ones ending in 6666 or 8888. Moreover, if a winning message is sent and the recipient does not redeem it, there will be no reminders.
For the policyholder, this is another trap. Getting free 60,000 yuan coverage for critical illnesses is temporary. If one relies solely on this without any other commercial insurance, in the event of a critical illness, what can 60,000 yuan do? It won’t solve the problem, and their life will be left exposed thereafter.
Currently, the state is also cracking down hard on the misguidance of internet insurance sales.
So all things considered, there is no issue with the platform, nor with the product; the issue lies in the professionalism and work ethics of the salesperson.
It is recommended that the questioner consider carefully and comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some of these products also have a better cost-performance ratio than internet products.
I have personally assisted 59 internet customers in underwriting offline products, saving each person 2000-3000 yuan per year in premiums.
If anyone has any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange ideas with me.
I am Mingya, an insurance broker with over 3 years of experience in corporate management training. I have served nearly a thousand corporate users and collaborated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insuring, I tailor insurance products based on customer needs. During the insurance process, I compare offers from different insurers to strive for the best underwriting outcome for my clients. After insuring, I organize and manage insurance policies for my clients, allowing them to rest assured and worry-free.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition by the insurance regulatory authorities, internet insurance refers to the insurance business where the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance application processes after clicking on the insurance link.
During this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant, as all steps can be independently completed by the policyholder.
Although purchasing insurance through the internet may lack a sense of ceremony and might not even include a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal enforceability of the electronic contract in any way.
This mode is somewhat similar to the assembly line operation of "telemarketing," but such a way of purchasing insurance can also present a fatal issue, which is that the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract spanning decades. When we purchase insurance, shouldn't we seriously consider whether the "agent" we choose is one that can accompany us for the long term and provide us with services many years later?
How can I get in touch with the delivery person?
It's almost 3 o'clock now.
Does that mean you have to give me compensation?
I said to knock on the door and deliver the goods.
But the rider just left it at the door and then walked away.
Mistakenly sent again.
Your rider has already picked up my takeout at #NUMBER#, but I am still being informed to wait.
The rider has already received my food delivery at 19:25, but still refuses to leave.
After I finish the shopping, do you want to order any other takeout?
What should I do?
Where has your rider gone?
Do we still have to wait?
I am here to make a delivery.
Okay, if you don't cancel, I will call the police.
But my food might have safety and hygiene issues.

Just redeem the discount code.
No problem, remember there is no need to arrange for a redelivery, as I have already made another purchase and do not wish to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I oppose any form of defamation and vilification, and cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such scoundrels.
If we disregard political parties and factions, what we must first oppose is this uncivilized style.
Since you started sending me friend requests on Facebook and then making mocking posts, to your attempt to publish so-called location of my home and my father's name on social media, I have maintained an attitude of not responding.
After that, you intensified your efforts by not only tagging me at a frequency of six times a day, but also continued to discuss, without any restraint, some obscure and humiliating comments about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, talking about my looks, body shape, fertility, and making remarks about 'growing strawberries in bed' and whether to 'stick it in' or not, I... let it be.
How would I know that later on, I would receive messages from several friends about your Facebook account posting a photo of you and comments containing sexual harassment.
As a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news of my calling the police was uploaded, you did not restrain yourself at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your status and identity. In our society, respect between the genders is required.
Yes, you can continue with such teasing, cryptic, humiliating, and abusive remarks. You can also keep saying that you are just caring for and paying attention to me. You can continue to believe that this is not harassment, you can even keep denying that those images were created by you, or keep making all kinds of aggressive statements.
Indeed, I cannot, nor do I have the power to stop you.
I neither know you nor wish to know you, and my appearance and figure certainly don't need your comments and critiques.
I don't even think there would be any girl who would be willing to let others humiliate her like this just to become famous.
Friend asks me, are you okay?
Even if I agree, you still won't believe it.
I believe that no girl could say she is okay after being bullied like that.
Regardless of whether it's in the workplace, society, politics, or business, only those who lack even basic morals would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice lies in the hearts of the people.
I've captured part of the comments for everyone to judge.
The posts you made yourself shouldn't be able to be impersonated by anyone else, right?
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization.

Vietnam People's Daily Online - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attends the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprises Development Forum.
During the third Vietnam National Forum on the Development of Digital Technology Enterprises, two main sessions were held to discuss topics around the role of digital technology enterprises in national digital transformation and the economic recovery and development during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Minister of Information and Communications, Nguyen Manh Hung, stated that in 2021, despite the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number and business revenue of Vietnamese digital technology firms still maintained a growth trend, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam was cultivated, focusing on solving the major difficulties faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's ranking in digital technology has improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology companies to take on the responsibility of developing the national digital transformation platform and to undertake the task of developing these national digital platforms as a national mission.
At the forum, leaders of various departments and state agencies, as well as enterprises, organizations, and individuals who are researching, developing, applying, and transferring digital technologies shared groundbreaking ideas and solutions for mobilizing and gathering society-wide resources to develop Vietnamese technology companies. Together, they promote the national digital transformation and the post-pandemic economic recovery.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, serving the whole population, thus requiring the mobilization of everyone's participation.
People and enterprises are the core, main body, target, and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies need to be for the people and businesses.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized that the digital transformation must reflect the national spirit, and should primarily rely on internal strength, strategy, long-term and decisive factors, with external forces playing an important role and serving as a breakthrough point.
He also believes that digital transformation needs to drive development in depth and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome the phenomenon of natural resource depletion, and help facilitate the green transition and the development of green energy.
The digital transformation requires participation in the establishment of databases that protect and promote national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs, and the like, driving digital transformation in areas such as banking, taxation, land management and development databases, as well as logistics.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make the people happier and the nation increasingly prosperous and developed.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng called on governments at all levels, agencies, and enterprises to intensify their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, enhance their understanding of digital transformation, continue to develop and perfect systems regarding digital transformation, strengthen national governance, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises with a spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity, and proactivity.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the 2021 "Made in Vietnam" Digital Product Awards Ceremony and the launch ceremony of the "Made in Vietnam" Digital Product Exhibition.

The household appliances here are quite comprehensive, with numerous brands, including all the well-known ones.
During the Double Twelve shopping festival, I went to the "Hansdon" water purifier store to check out the water purifiers. There was a promotion going on at the store, and the prices were quite favorable.
Home of Surprisingly has a total of 11 floors, ranging from basement two to the ninth floor, where basement one and two are parking spaces, and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are not very impressive, with only a few restaurants and hardware stores, and the food at the restaurants is just mediocre.
This elevator is really speechless, just like a serious illness, going back and forth from B2 to B1, not stopping at the floor I pressed. Heading down to the first floor through the emergency exit is also frustrating, as it leads straight into a furniture store, and with the furniture store closed, there's no way to exit through the emergency passage!
Juran Home still needs improvement; there are many areas that are not developed yet.
Address: No. 555, High-Speed Rail North 1st Road, Shayibake District, easily accessible, with a large parking lot, which is free during the day.
Environment: To be honest, the store is quite spacious with 8 to 9 floors. You can find everything you want for your home here—furniture, appliances, all kinds of small items... Many reputable brands have set up shop here, such as Mousse, Oppein, Vatti, Robam, PEAK Home, Hansdom, Yake, Aupu, Sliwo, Fupinju, Macro, Dnatura, Zhonglian, Midea, Yadan... There are really so many brands that I can only remember so many. It's a great place to shop for products. If you get tired, you can sit and rest on a sofa.
Recently, I've been wanting to buy a comfortable sofa, and my friend mentioned there are many choices here. I looked at Kuka Home and M&K, and they seem okay, but the prices are a bit expensive, so I'm still hesitating.
Dianping's Urumqi Home Store Channel provides you with the latest merchant information like the address, phone number, and business hours of High-speed Rail Home Mall. For home renovation companies, just go to Dianping.

The Yangtze River main stream achieves full coverage of green integrated service areas on water - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) - The Fuling Waterborne Green Comprehensive Service Area in Chongqing was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second waterborne green comprehensive service area to officially begin operations in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, following the launch of the Luzhou Waterborne Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan Province on the 8th.
To date, the aquatic green comprehensive service zone has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Vice Director Qiu Jianhua of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration under the Ministry of Transport introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have established and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of mariners and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the Green Comprehensive Service Area on water is yet another milestone event in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River, with a significant enhancement in the capability to receive ship pollutants and shipping services on the river.
According to the introduction, the aquatic green integrated service area is an important facility that provides comprehensive production and living services for a wide range of vessels and crew members, helping them to solve urgent, difficult, and troubling issues.
The two newly-established waterborne green comprehensive service areas on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate living, production, and governmental services. Focused on green environmental protection, they feature ship maintenance and emergency rescue services, allowing ships to dock once and receive multiple services within the harbor. This will make the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and their lives more convenient throughout the year.
Three US Aircraft Carriers Assemble Near China, Most Powerful Weapons Make Rare Visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Duowei Pro-CCP media Duowei reports: The latest news on Sino-US relations: New satellite images reveal that three US aircraft carriers are assembling near China; US media also reveal that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal has made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI), a Chinese think tank, on January 9th, satellites spotted the US Navy aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Sunda Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, serving as a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy the "Carl Vinson" to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier "USS Carl Vinson" has deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier-onboard delivery aircraft.
The U.S. aircraft carriers currently cruising on the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the "USS Carl Vinson," include the "USS Abraham Lincoln," which departed from the United States on January 3rd.
The "Lincoln" was also the first to carry a squadron of F-35C carrier-based aircraft, which belonged to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked at Yokosuka, Japan, deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The carrier battle group also includes the "Shangri-La Lake" missile cruiser, the "Stockdale" missile destroyer, and others.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative" released the latest satellite images, showing three U.S. aircraft carriers gathering around China.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative) Three US aircraft carriers gather around China; most powerful weapons make a rare visit to Guam. January 17, 2022, flight path of the US Navy's CMV-22B carrier onboard delivery aircraft.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative) According to a report by the Cable News Network (CNN) on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam over the weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine "USS Nevada," equipped with 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the United States Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
Three US aircraft carriers assemble near China, with the most powerful weapons making a rare visit to Guam. Analysts say this is a signal to allies and adversaries in the increasingly tense Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three US aircraft carriers gather near China, with the most powerful weapons making a rare visit to Guam as China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Reef in the Spratly Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy stated in a declaration that the visit of the Ohio-class submarine "USS Nevada" to Guam enhances cooperation between the United States and allies in the region, demonstrates America's capability, flexibility, readiness, and ongoing commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines."
The movements of the 14 "Thunder submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding the ballistic missile submarine make the "Thunder Submarine" the most crucial survivable weapon in the "nuclear triad," which also includes silo-based ballistic missiles on the US mainland and bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads such as the B-2 and B-52.
Recently, Meta's stock plummeted 26%, erasing $251 billion in market value. Zuckerberg responded that they are "facing competition like never before." What is the reason for this?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with the majority of its revenue coming from ads. In this day and age, a profitable advertising company possesses its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc., no matter what their functional positioning is, are all traffic channels for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", with many apps connecting to Meta's ads, monetizing through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
Firstly, due to adjustments in Apple's privacy policy, Meta finds it difficult to obtain user data, which affects the efficiency of ad placements.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, as it clearly prompts users whether they permit apps to access their information, and the normal reaction of most people would certainly be to disallow it.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor that contributed to Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta doesn't have operations in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Each year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, primarily contributed by Chinese companies engaged in overseas business.
Meta has roughly a few hundred employees in its Hong Kong office, and it also has several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies looking to expand into the overseas market can hardly bypass Meta as an advertising channel, with much of the money spent going to Meta.
It's interesting that ByteDance's TikTok is now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the past two years, Meta has made a substantial amount of money from ByteDance.
Domestic agencies are all helping ByteDance to place advertisements with Meta, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region is also quite impressive.
Recently, I haven't specifically looked into it, but for sure it won't be better than before.
The phase of Chinese companies massively burning cash overseas has already passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not going smoothly.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms including TikTok are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets care not only about income but more importantly, about future expectations.
Evidently, Meta's expectations were not met.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "metaverse."
The metaverse should indeed be one of the directions for the future, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story is probably not enough to support Meta's market value over the next two to three years.
So the next two years should be a relatively tough period for Meta.
Despite Facebook's current glory, boasting annual revenues between 100 and 200 billion dollars, the company actually has a strong sense of crisis. Compared to other internet enterprises and high-tech companies, it lacks any good, secure moats.
Although his several social media apps currently have high daily active users and are mainstream social apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp and so on, facing the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook does not have much confidence, and disruption could happen in the blink of an eye.
The concept of the metaverse is an elusive one, with no hope for success in the short term, which makes Facebook very risky. This is the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg keeps changing the company's name and incessantly searching for new tracks. However, I believe his choice of track is wrong, it's a dead-end road. The above are some of my thoughts, for your reference.
