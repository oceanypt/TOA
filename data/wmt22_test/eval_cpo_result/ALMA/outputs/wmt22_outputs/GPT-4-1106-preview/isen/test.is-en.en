Shouted at the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland is considered to have had a successful launch, and the shouts and calls of the wild are beginning to tug at people from all over the world.
"You own the riddle, I need Iceland," says a woman out in the big world in the comments on an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the content platform YouTube.
Another spectator declares they will keep Iceland in their heart forever, and a young woman says she must get to Iceland as soon as possible since her fiancé lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States and therefore expects to have to wait for several more months.
Yet another spectator asks if the walking path to Iceland is passable, as there are no airplanes.
The story does not reveal whether he comes from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson at the advertising agency Peel, which was involved in the production of the commercials together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the reception has exceeded expectations.
"I've been a part of many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already breaking records."
Fundamentally, this is about creating PR value, that is getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it has been incredibly successful.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world that collectively reach well over two billion people.
The value of that coverage is priced at 1.8 billion krona.
It's not bad.
The main market is usually the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there even though Americans are not imminently traveling to the country.
According to Egill, well-known markets such as Denmark, the UK, and Germany have also been well-received, as well as Russia, which has been a pleasant surprise.
Then there were reactions from foreign regions, such as India, which were not specifically intended.
"These advertisements have traveled further than we expected," says Egill, but it is worth mentioning that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We could not have asked for a better start."
The photos here at the opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, a photographer for Morgunblaðið, during the shooting of advertisements titled "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The filming took place far and wide, such as on Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík, at Reynisfjara, by Skógafoss, on Sólheimajökull glacier, and in a cave near Hjörleifshöfði.
Directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti Productions and the cinematographer was Óttar Guðnason.
In the roles in the mentioned takes were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
Two Icelanders were involved in the making of the advertisements, but at the same time as filming took place in the South, another group was in the West and the Westfjords.
According to Egill, "Let It Out" is just the first step in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but a winter campaign is planned in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase in this project for Promote Iceland," says Egill and adds that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has been going exceptionally well.
It's great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are engaging with.
Sprengisandur: Discuss the situation in the labor market, pension funds, and much more
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, will appear on Sprengisand, which starts at ten o'clock on Bylgjan today.
He is also the Minister of Labor and discusses the situation in the labor market as such, the Icelandair issue, and other matters.
He also discusses rural affairs and the relocation of jobs to the countryside, which has been problematic and controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR (Commercial Workers' Union Iceland), will also appear on the show to discuss his criticism concerning the investments of pension funds and will present ideas about labor unions and employers withdrawing from the funds' boards to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then we will talk to Ívar Ingimarsson, a tourism professional in East Iceland, and Árnheiður Jóhannsdóttir, the managing director of the Marketing Office of North Iceland, about the situation in rural tourism.
They will look forward to autumn and ponder whether the summer's success is a misleading omen of what is to come.
You can listen to the episode below, but it starts at ten o'clock.
This is what she looks like today, 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in all sorts of teen shows.
She gained worldwide fame for her role as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
Then she also acted in the series Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
She has not been much in the limelight recently, but she was persuaded to reflect on the past and speak about Clueless on Australian television recently.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who passed away unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a wonderful person.
"I have to admit that I mostly based the character on girls I met in school who were not nice to me."
"As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan said about her role in Clueless.
Refused to leave the police station after spending the night
About fifty cases came to the attention of the police in the capital area today, and the police log says that the cases were diverse.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to intervene with a man who had just been released from a holding cell after being detained there for drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the police orders telling him to go away.
The man earned himself a continued stay at the police station due to his behavior.
Then a man was arrested in the early morning suspected of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to intervene with two men in Breiðholt because of a report of assault.
Then there was also an incident where a woman who was dining in a shopping mall in Kópavogur couldn't pay her bill after finishing her meal, so the police were called.
Also, a report of a vehicle theft in the downtown area this morning was announced.
The driver of the white Renault delivery vehicle looked away from her for a moment, and then she was taken by force.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Glee Club - The Terrible Fate of the Gleestars
The theory has gained traction on the Internet that a curse looms over the TV series "Glee," as actress Naya Rivera drowned recently in California, thus becoming the third main cast member of the show to die prematurely.
The series about Glee are a popular show about singing, dancing, and joy.
The series deals with so-called cheer-squads of teenagers in high school, their loves, and fates.
It wasn't always a bed of roses to be in the cheer squad, but through singing and dancing, the characters in the show seemed to overcome whatever situations arose in their lives.
But off the set, great tragedies have befallen the actors and crew of the show, so much so that theories have arisen that a curse rests on the series.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who didn't call everything her grandmother's.
After the series had run its course, Rivera went on to marry the actor Ryan Dorsey and had her first and only child with him, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they subsequently divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to file a complaint, and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8th last year, it was reported that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on a drifting boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life vest on board the boat and he was able to tell the police authorities that he and his mother had gone swimming and then Rivera had helped him back onto the boat but never returned herself.
A large-scale search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area reported that the search was proceeding on the assumption that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared deceased.
It is believed that she encountered a strong current in the water and used her last strength to save her son.
Cause of death was recorded as accidental drowning.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the voice of an angel who played a key role in bringing the Glee Club to prominence and respect.
Outside of the shows, Moneith still grappled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his colleagues on the show felt enough was enough, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and everything seemed to be looking up.
Just two months after completing treatment, Monteith was found dead in a hotel room after having gone out to have fun with friends.
Banamein turned out to be a deadly mix of drugs and alcohol.
It was not considered to be an intentional act.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for intoxicants had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well turned out to be fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he passed away.
His passing weighed heavily on his colleagues, but at the urging of his co-star, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue filming the episodes, and they dedicated an entire episode to the memory of Monteith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the series; Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow Glee Club members, until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of possession of child pornography.
During a search at his home, an enormous amount of child pornography was found and the case quickly became public knowledge.
It was clear that Salling was done for.
He was subsequently charged and convicted for his offenses.
He was facing four to seven years in prison, in addition to which he would have to be registered as a sex offender and seek treatment for pedophilia.
Before the judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who was then released on bail, was found dead near his home.
Cause of death was suicide.
Not only the series' actors passed away long before their time.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the episodes.
He passed away unexpectedly in his sleep in 2013, at the age of only 41.
In the series, a woman named Nancy Motes also worked.
She was the younger sister of the superstar Julia Roberts and did not bear her sister kind tales, accusing Roberts of being highly controlling and treating her with disrespect.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her boyfriend in which she among other things blamed her mother and sister for her circumstances.
"My mother and so-called siblings will receive nothing from me except the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression."
Lea Michele was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying her co-stars and being overpowering on set, displaying diva-like behavior.
Jesse Luken had a guest role in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a great scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
She was subjected to it in 2010 when unscrupulous computer hackers accessed nude photos of her and published them on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and were in a romantic relationship off the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had been abusive to her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything
Playing outside in the garden with their parents, cultivating flowers and watching them grow and flourish, enhances children's development.
Flowers can also be endlessly created with, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a moment with the children in the garden is something that is never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and of course the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat after tenth grade
"I think there are not many fishermen who work in the kindergartens of the country," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who engages in coastal fishing in the summers but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter."
Beach fishing is a very convenient summer job when you are studying.
If fishing goes well, it's possible to have a good income and I think it's great to be able to avoid taking student loans.
"The earnings also sustain me well into the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who engages in coastal fishing in the summer just as in previous summers.
Axel had just docked at the pier in Tálknafjörður when a journalist caught up with him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.
"The winter when I was in tenth grade, I obtained my boat captain's license for boats that are under twelve meters long and I bought my own boat the summer after I finished elementary school."
I have gone sea angling in my boat all summers since then.
I bought the used boat from my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after him.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and had stopped going to sea and he was very content when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
"I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer, and the other half at the end of summer when I would have finished fishing."
I therefore owned the boat debt-free at the end of that first summer of mine on it.
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out for a boat when he had just finished primary school?
"I had been saving and collecting money, I had been working with dad at sea when I was a boy, I spent all summers fishing with him and got my share."
I also put my confirmation money into my boat fund.
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all of his mother's family is from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
"I am allowed to fish here in the western area because I have a legal residence with my grandmother in Ísafjörður."
I learned about these areas here in the west from rowing with Dad.
I move between the fjords depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Although I like being in the west the best, I have also fished around the Snæfellsnes peninsula and elsewhere.
I have also fished in the south, mainly for lumpfish," says Axel, who always rows out alone early in the morning and says he sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, in solitude for hours on end out on the open sea.
"The internet connection out at sea is good, so I can make calls, listen to podcast episodes, and music."
I have no problem being alone on a boat.
"Of course, I try to avoid getting into danger, but certainly, there have been times when something has been off with the weather, but never a great danger," says Axel, who is lucky in that he never gets seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the fishing goes each time.
"In the shore fishing, I'm never more than 14 hours at a time fishing, but I have also been fishing in other systems, like the lease quota, and then I've been continuously for one and a half days baiting at sea fishing."
The arrangement in coastal fishing, he says, is such that he is allowed to fish 770 kilos per day, which he finds restrictive.
Other restrictions are that I cannot fish on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only fish for twelve days in a month, during the four months that coastal fishing is in season, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days based on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to rush instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to choose at will.
The regional division might as well go my way, and coastal places that are well situated near fishing grounds should get to enjoy that," says Axel, who mostly draws cod from the briny sea on his coastal fishing trips, but also a bit of haddock and the occasional other species come along.
Axel works over the winter with his university studies at the preschool Núpur in Kópavogur.
"I think we are not many sailors who work in the country's preschools," says Axel proudly and adds that he had only intended to work temporarily at the preschool.
"I got stuck there because I think this is an awesome job."
I hope that the psychology studies will be useful for me at the kindergarten level in the future," says Axel, who is also far along in his business studies.
An error in registration prevented the homecoming infection control.
A mistake in the registration form that people fill out upon entering the country resulted in an individual, residing here, not being called back for sampling.
It is not a requirement to enter an identification number if the individual fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
"This will be examined during the week," says a specialist at the epidemiological department of the Directorate of Health.
Three domestic infections were identified at the Virology Department of the National Hospital yesterday.
One of those who tested positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the rules on so-called homecoming infection control took effect.
Those who were residing in Iceland are then screened upon arrival in the country and called back for sampling four to five days later.
It was reported in RÚV's midday news that the person in question had, however, followed the old system.
The sample taken at the border was negative and he was not called back for further screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist at the Directorate of Health's department of epidemic control, says in an interview with the newsroom that this can be traced back to an error in the electronic registration form.
When people fill out the registration form in English, it is not a requirement to enter an ID number as it is in the Icelandic version.
Although it was first and foremost intended for foreign tourists.
Because the person in question did not receive an automatic invitation to come for sampling.
Kamilla says that many have still complied with the rules regarding the domestic transmission barrier, although they filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been vigilant in sending people for testing again after they arrived in the country.
"This will be reviewed during the week to see how it is possible to make it easier for people to access this by drawing their attention to the process."
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all go for testing but two had started showing symptoms.
Contact tracing is now underway for the three infections identified yesterday, but is largely completed for the two cases that were reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequencing by deCODE Genetics has revealed variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the other case, the connections have been directed towards Israel although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be clear by tomorrow where the virus is coming from.
There are now 15 in isolation according to the website COVID.is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been identified in the country in recent days.
Of them, four are completely unrelated and, for example, the origin of the infection that emerged at the Rey Cup sports event yesterday has not yet been found.
Contact tracing is still ongoing.
Originally, nearly thirty individuals were placed in quarantine, but that number was reduced to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 in quarantine due to these new infections that were identified yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period that an infection has been detected at a sporting event, and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, the communications officer at the Civil Protection Department of the National Police Commissioner, says it is quite possible, as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
"We are constantly emphasizing to everyone who lives here that they need to maintain individual infection precautions."
We also need to emphasize to people who are organizing events that there are specific rules in place that must be followed.
Then it is possible to hold events," says Jóhann.
He says that it is possible to prevent infections by maintaining individual infection control measures.
Rules and standards are also under constant review.
What needs to be done, and what the Civil Protection Department and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer are constantly emphasizing to people, is to pay attention to these individual infection prevention measures.
Both at home and likewise at service companies.
People should wash their hands and use hand sanitizer.
It prevents the infection from spreading further," says Jóhann.
"We need to emphasize to people the importance of continuing on the good path we were on, in order to maintain the success we have achieved so far."
40% of COVID-19 victims had type 2 diabetes
Devon Brumfield heard through the phone how difficult her father struggled to breathe.
Her father had diabetes and so she urged him to seek medical assistance.
The next day he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden respiratory difficulties due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was identified on the death certificate as an underlying issue, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same fate awaits her.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fear is not without reason.
The figures of a new study commissioned by US authorities show that nearly 40% of those who have died had type 2 diabetes as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the percentage rises to half.
The investigation of the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus during the period from February through May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease expert at the CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
The growth was hidden in slow increments; Reuters had a survey done and the answers from the 12 states that responded point to comparable ratios.
10 states, among them California, Arizona, and Columbia, have not yet started to report underlying diseases.
Diabetes was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful wave," Reuters quotes Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among black people and those of South American descent, who have also been harder hit by the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with diabetes type 2 is to keep the disease under control with exercise, a healthy diet, and the assistance of healthcare professionals.
The coronavirus pandemic, however, has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
Then, the high cost of insulin has forced some to continue going to work and thus risk being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that the US authorities had to be aware of the danger that those with type 2 diabetes could pose from the virus.
When the SARS coronavirus epidemic occurred in 2003, over 20% of those with the disease were at risk, and during the swine flu pandemic in 2009, this group was three times more likely to need hospitalization.
When MERS emerged in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could last longer, the pandemic has unveiled a number of previously unknown complications.
"I fear that we will see a tsunami of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, the chairman of the International Diabetes Federation.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus epidemic could indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney diseases and renal impairment.
Recent studies indicate that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in cases of diabetes.
Reuters reports that scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weakened in many people with diabetes.
Then a high percentage of glucose and lipids in diabetics can induce a veritable "cytokine storm," as it's called when the immune system reacts too aggressively and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause a fatal blood clot.
"This is all one big jigsaw puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
Everything is interconnected.
The news has been corrected.
"We were offered champagne, then they left the room"
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason agreed to the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was installing in Paris.
"We loved each other so this was not complicated."
Atli Bollason will never forget when he met his wife and the mother of his children, Ásrúna Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
I became very charmed by her.
It was naturally just the radiation but then I also thought she was incredibly cute.
And is still thought to be," he says.
Ásrún also remembers this, as her husband regularly brings up their first meeting.
"I always hear this story."
"Just last weekend," she says, who was also attracted to her husband at first meeting.
"I felt and still feel such excitement around Atli, which I dig."
There's a lot going on and a lot happening and I was charmed by it.
Atli says the couple has emphasized in their relationship the importance of going their own ways.
"We don't tie our bundles with the same knots as our fellow travelers."
We avoid routines that we identify around us.
It is possibly the reason why they received the errand from Ragnar Kjartansson, the artist, with such enthusiasm, even though it was, to say the least, unusual.
Kristín Anna, our mutual friend, has contacted us to ask if we can join her, Ragga, and Ingibjörg, Ragnar's wife, for dessert at Snaps.
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had dessert wine and a dessert each.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plans for an art exhibition that he intended to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
He had a multi-channel video work called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way.
Ásrún says that he described the work as lethal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he intended to shoot and last he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in."
The scene Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was supposed to show a young middle-class couple making love in a minimalist room.
"These are interactions with a beginning and an end," says Atli.
The couple didn't know Ragnar well, although they were aware of him and he of them "but they knew us and thought we were a good fit for this.
They mentioned that they did not want to advertise for people.
Perhaps they thought that they would not get the right people, but rather individuals who would derive sexual gratification from performing for others.
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to consider the matter, but it didn't take long.
"When we walked out of Snaps we said: Aren't we just up for this?"
This was just how it was.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team," says Ásrún, and Atli agrees.
"It's about the love and the intimacy"
The scene was filmed in a fancy apartment on Mýrargata.
There was a very small film crew; a cameraman, Ragnar, and a sound engineer, and the couple.
After the recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait outside in the car except for Atli and Ásrún.
"We had not yet decided how we should be."
We received some minor instructions but we tried to forget time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no game-playing; we just loved each other, so it was not complicated," says Ásrún.
Was this romantic?
"Yes, that was a bit romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agrees.
"We were offered champagne before they left the room."
This was a bit like being on vacation at a fancy hotel in Paris.
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the play that moved them.
"When Tommi the cameraman looked at this, he cried; he found it so beautiful," says Atli.
"This is just as much about the love and intimacy as it is about the actual intercourse," says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and Atli says his mother heard the voice of her son at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to ponder this," says Atli.
"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris."
We hadn't told anyone this but then dad just sends me a message and says: "Nice bumping into the little family at the Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.
And I wonder if the participation in the project deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
"At least we are still together so maybe this deepened something."
This at least deepened my relationship with my in-laws," says Ásrún and laughs.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"I found it a bit difficult not to be with you but with someone else," she says, turning to her husband.
"But it was fun to see this because it is just one scene in a much larger work and when you saw it with the other works, it is very impressive."
I was able to tear myself away from this a little bit and was just proud.
"And there was the little bean in my belly," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the scene was filmed.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Ásrún and Atli in Love Stories on Channel 1.
Swansea with a win in the first semi-final match
Swansea won a 1—0 victory over Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first leg of the teams in the semi-finals of the play-offs to get promoted to the English Premier League.
The game took place at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The score at halftime was 0–0.
The locals in Swansea received a penalty at the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew fluffed his technique from the penalty spot and had it saved.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a player for Brentford, received a red card.
Brentford played the rest of the match with a man down and in the 82nd minute, the Swansea players took advantage of the numerical superiority.
Andre Ayew made up for the penalty blunder by scoring a fantastic goal and secured a 1–0 victory for Swansea.
Swansea leads the tie 1-0, with the second leg to take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
Ambassador-free for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the American ambassador to Iceland, is in the media spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard because he feared for his life.
However, it has not been without difficulty for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here in Iceland.
Since Carol Van Voorst stepped down from the position of the United States Ambassador in April 2009, the country has been without an ambassador for a total of 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned from office under peculiar circumstances, but the investigative program Kastljós reported in 2009 that she was supposed to receive the Order of the Falcon.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the Presidential Office stating that she would not be awarded the honor.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work in September 2010.
To some extent, it can be attributed to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as an ambassador but then changed his mind.
After a long search, Louis Ariega, who had worked in the foreign service for decades, finally took the job.
He then retired in the fall of 2013 and assumed the position of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then another period without an ambassador began.
Robert Barber received the approval of the United States Congress in January 2015 and took office shortly thereafter, but by then no ambassador had been in place for 13 months.
Barber was a political appointee and not a diplomat; instead, he had worked as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's election fund.
He resigned from his post as soon as Donald Trump assumed the presidency, on January 20, 2017, as is customary with politically appointed ambassadors.
The Trump administration took an unusually long time to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in the Washington bureaucracy.
Two years passed until the United States Congress summoned Jeffrey Ross Gunter to its meeting to thoroughly question him and subsequently confirm him as the ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony to the parliament, he said that he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, and that his wife, who is deceased, had been of Dutch descent.
Gunter is a political appointee who previously worked as a dermatologist in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition in the Republican Party.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, and Adelson is an ardent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter arrived for work in Iceland in May 2019, but at that time no ambassador had been in the country since early in 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest such instance on record in this country.
The reason is both how long Trump's administration took to nominate people to key positions and that in recent years, the work of the US Congress has been very protracted, including confirming ambassadors to their posts.
Since 2009, there has, therefore, been no ambassador in Iceland for a total of over five years.
However, that has not prevented the embassy's operations from opening new headquarters at Engjateig recently.
The construction is estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion and thick security walls encircle the building and bulletproof glass is in all the windows.
However, it seems not to have been enough to provide the current ambassador with a sense of security, as he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former ÍBV player experienced racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former ÍBV player, says he experienced racism while he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This is mentioned in an interview with Tonny that appeared on the Ugandan media outlet Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the team Uganda Police FC, which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses many things, including his time here in the country where he played for ÍBV, Valur, and Þróttur in Iceland.
"When I came to Iceland I didn't play in the middle as I was used to playing."
The team captain was in that position, but he also had the jersey number that I wanted, so I ended up not getting either of the things I wanted," says Tonny, as he played on the right flank during the season with ÍBV.
Among the things that Tonny discusses is the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
This happened to me once but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was being said to me.
Later I heard about the case and then I asked my friend what the case was about.
He then told me that my opponent had made racist remarks about me after I tackled him.
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway where he joined Haugesund.
There he says that he made the mistakes that he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to secure a place in the starting lineup for Haugesund, but he wanted to play more in order to join the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan and he then joined Valur.
"It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan."
I think that if I had stayed longer in Norway, I would have gotten the opportunity that I wanted," says Tonny, hoping that if he played well in Norway, he would probably go further.
He insists that the loan to Iceland ruined his dreams of making it to a big team in Europe.
Found a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black worm in the tonsil of a woman who sought help there.
Doctors managed to pull out the worm with forceps.
The investigation revealed that it was a parasite.
CNN reports this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days before, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman quickly recovered after the worm was removed, but parasites like this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi made its way into the Western world, cases where parasites have been transferred to people have increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now in the spotlight in connection with concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where authorities have taken action to curb the spread of the coronavirus outbreak anew.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, as there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken measures due to the increase in infections in Spain, with the UK requiring all individuals to quarantine upon returning from Spain, similar to Norway, and the French have been warned against traveling to Spain.
Infections are also on the rise again in France and Germany, where authorities are trying to find a balance between curbing the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
The situation in Europe is relatively good compared to other parts of the world, with nearly 300,000 new cases daily worldwide, with the majority of infections in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University's count, and deaths confirmed to be related to the virus have reached 644 thousand.
Gerðar's mosaic work finally gets to be fully appreciated
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavik is a large and deep hole.
Inside there are men with orange helmets.
There is also a big dig.
And more small work machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the sidewalk is narrow and now many people pause and admire the artwork made of millions of mosaic tiles — as if they have never seen it before.
Maybe they have never seen it before.
At least not considered it worth their while.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it there were parking spaces that were always busy.
People stopped there, quickly locked the car and then dashed off to run their errands in the downtown area.
"Lively and diverse public spaces" and "an attractive urban character" are guiding principles in the redevelopment of Tryggvagata which is currently underway.
The objective is to beautify the area and allow the mosaic work of Gerður Helgadóttir on the Customs House to be more visible.
In front of the work, there will be a plaza, and since the area is well-oriented to the sun, it is considered suitable as a resting area for passersby.
The artwork will be lit up and now the material can be better appreciated than before on this 142 square meter surface.
In the area, there will also be small "mist diffusers," a sort of water sculpture, that offer play and give the area a certain sense of mystery.
The renovations are described in this manner by the City of Reykjavik, which is carrying out the works in collaboration with Veitur.
The water supply, heating supply, and electrical supply systems will be renovated.
Many of them have reached their years, but the sewer and cold water pipes are from the year 1925 and have therefore served the residents and businesses in the downtown area for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after the completion of construction, cars can drive on it again.
However, it will become a one-way street and at the same time a calmer and more accessible space will be created for pedestrians.
In the information about the Customs House on the Customs Director's website, it is stated that the building was put into use in 1971 and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because the harbor shed extended through the house, a 250 square meter windowless wall surface facing the street was formed.
The building committee and architect agreed that such a surface would have a negative impact on the overall streetscape, unless special measures were taken to embellish the appearance of the house.
The parties therefore agreed to plan on erecting a permanent piece of art there.
At that time, a lot of talk was about Gerður Helgadóttir, the artist, the summary says.
She had worked extensively on mosaic artworks in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to first contact her before it would be decided whether a competition would be held for the project.
Often it had been discussed that the work needed to reflect life at the harbor, since the harbor had been the lifeline of Reykjavik since it was made.
When the artist was spoken to, she immediately became fascinated by such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country again, as she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerdur was given the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home, she presented several proposals for discussion.
The approval was immediately given to ask her to undertake the task.
At the same time, a desire was expressed to enter into a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous art enterprise in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, as Gerður had long collaborated with them on the installation of famous artworks throughout Europe.
Negotiations were successful, and Gerður created the artwork during the setup of their brothers' workshop, who then took care of installing it in the Customs House.
The entire work was exceptionally well executed, both by Gerðar Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, the summary states.
It has ever since withstood the harsh Icelandic weather.
It took Gerður about two years to complete the work, which was done and installed in the years 1972 and 1973.
The artist passed away two years after the Tollhús project was completed, only 47 years old.
Prepares the relocation of more institutions to the countryside
Minister of social affairs Ásmundur Einar Daðason announces that more public institutions will be moved to the countryside in the near future.
The minister said this on the Sprengisandur program on Bylgjan at noon.
Recently, it was announced that the Fire Safety Department of the Housing and Construction Authority will be moved to Sauðárkrókur in the fall.
Six fire experts work at the institution, but none of them intend to follow the institution north, and the National Association of Firefighters and Paramedics has criticized the relocations.
"I think we should take further steps towards this creature."
I am preparing further steps into this being.
Further transport,“ said Ásmundur.
He says he is convinced that a large majority of the nation wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
"I think that further political decisions are needed regarding the relocation of public jobs to the countryside, like I was doing with the Housing and Construction Authority," said Ásmundur. He also cited examples of other institutions that have been moved to rural areas and are very important to local communities, such as relocating the Food Agency to Selfoss, the National Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes, and the unemployment insurance services to Skagaströnd.
All the main events from the second day of the Champions Tournament
94. The Icelandic Athletics Championships concluded at Þórsvöllur in Akureyri today.
Some records were set on the second day of competition.
An exciting competition in women’s hammer throw was expected at Þórsvöllur, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Icelandic record in hammer throw in 2014, which stood until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR broke the record in May last year.
Vigdís reclaimed the national record for Iceland earlier this summer and has been in fantastic form lately, having improved the national record three times so far this summer.
Elísabet Rut has been dealing with injuries and couldn't get back on track today.
She only had one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the farthest today, a distance of 60.08 meters in her last attempt and set a new meet record in the process.
Her Icelandic record, which she set earlier in July, is 62.69 meters, and she was therefore quite far from that.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second-best throw of the day, as she improved her personal best with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's division, FH's Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic record holder in hammer throwing, secured a comfortable victory as he threw 73.84 meters in his penultimate throw, setting a record for the event.
His Icelandic record in the event is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympian and Icelandic record holder in discus throw, won a shot put competition at Þórsvöllur yesterday but today he competed in discus throw which is his main event.
Guðni Valur's Icelandic record is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest today at 59.13 meters and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second farthest today with one valid throw that was good enough for 2nd place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the Icelandic record holder in long jump, won the long jump competition with ease as Hafdís jumped the furthest today at 6.25 meters, which is nearly 40 cm short of her Icelandic record.
In the women's 200 meters, it was the IR athlete Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the swiftest, crossing the finish line in 24.04 seconds, while her national record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was successful in Akureyri as she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100-meter dash and the 4 x 100-meter relay, and also today in the 4 x 400-meter relay.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was the first to cross the finish line in the 200 meters race with a time of 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Máni Samúelsson from Ármann.
Just like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meter race.
Does not get fined for 27 million krona Bitcoin harvest
The National Tax Tribunal has rejected a claim by the Director of Tax Investigations demanding a fine against a man for underdeclaring his capital income, which resulted from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The committee comes to the conclusion that the Director of Tax Investigations had not provided clear reasons for why it was necessary to fine the man.
In the committee's decision, it is stated that the Director of Tax Investigations believed the man had submitted materially incorrect tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have underreported his capital gains from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin amounting to 27 million, either intentionally or due to gross negligence.
The man should be fined for his behavior.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
He admitted, however, to having sold cryptocurrency for 27 million in the year 2016.
He would have acquired her through mining between the years 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and inexpensive with a regular home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the tax implementation regarding such a sale had been significantly unclear and unpredictable.
It could hardly have been expected that ordinary citizens would be aware of such arrangements on their tax returns.
He had not intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and had declared his property on the tax return as a deposit in a foreign currency account.
He had inquired with both experts and the national tax authorities about how this was arranged, but without success.
Then he believed that it should be taken into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to acquaint himself with complex rules on which the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion.
The man therefore considered it right that his taxes for these two income years be reassessed and penalized, but otherwise no punishment would be made.
Then he reiterated that he works in Iceland and has been paying taxes here since 2012.
He never intended to shirk his responsibilities in an undue manner.
The demand for a fine would be excessive and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur sparks discussion: "This man understands what football is about."
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been quite the topic of conversation among people, but has also garnered admiration for his performance so far this season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max League.
Flashes will be on the firing line tonight as they host ÍA in a live broadcast on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur will serve a suspension due to accumulating four cautions over the season and therefore will not play with his new haircut as he has in the games this summer so far.
He had "bla, bla, bla" written on his head for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
"I don't know exactly who he was responding to with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was really trying in the game."
He did not go into hiding.
He wants the ball every single time and if there was someone who was going to equalize this game, I thought he would be the one to do it or create it," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stand, when the conversation turned to Brynjólfur.
"I am supposed to be here for the people."
"It is difficult sometimes to realize what situation he is in."
"He tends to drift a little to the left as the games progress, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólfur is a true entertainer and is delighted to have such a colorful person in the department: "No one disputes that he is a character.
This is a fun character and I love this with the hair, and to always be ready to attend and respond to interviews.
There are incredibly many people preoccupied with him, which tells me that this man understands what football is about.
I am an entertainer.
I am supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it.
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjolf, people are paying to get in and watch what comes next in his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Máni.
A KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in touch with several teams in Division B"
Tobias Thomsen, a player for KR in the Pepsi Max league, seems to be on his way out of the team.
According to the Danish outlet Bold, Tobias is ready to go back home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the case.
Tobias wants to catch the beginning of the season in his home country, but to do that, he first needs to cancel his contract with KR since the Danish league starts before the Icelandic one ends.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me great understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
I have been in contact with several teams in Division B and will likely switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to buy out my contract with KR.
Then he says that he will likely have to accept a pay cut in Denmark.
"Companies in Denmark have likely felt the economic impact of the virus more than in Iceland."
The bicycle whisperer Bjartmar has restored bikes worth millions - Now responds after DV coverage
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He sniffs out and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, e-bikes, and scooters.
For that reason, Bjartmar has earned the nickname "the bike whisperer."
Yesterday there was quite a kerfuffle when a man published an account of his interaction with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to discussions in the Facebook group of West Town residents where it was mentioned that Bjartmar had approached the man at Austurvöllur and said the scooter might be stolen.
There was nothing else to interpret from the original writings of the e-scooter rider but that Bjartmar had accused him of theft.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original DV article has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says that the original reports about the incident were not at all descriptive of what actually happened yesterday at Austurvöllur.
Bjartmar said he had received information from a victim of electric scooter theft that this was indeed his electric scooter.
The alleged owner received information from others, but the information turned out to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
I saw the guy and I recognized the scooter, knowing that there was an electric scooter that had been missing for a very long time and had been searched for.
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him preparing to drive off on the scooter, I decided to go ahead and talk to the man.
The owner was certain of his case and so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally, I handle such matters quite well, but before I was able to finish what I had to say, the man had interrupted me.
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter immediately offered to show him the receipt for the bike and had himself called the police.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just clear this up."
So it happened that the owner of the electric scooter proved ownership of their electric scooter and drove off.
Later, the rightful owner of the electric scooter shared his story on Facebook, as reported in an earlier news article.
In the brief year that Bjartmar has devoted himself to this practice, he says he can count on the fingers of one hand the times he has had a falling-out with people.
"I have had peaceful interactions with the toughest men of Reykjavik," said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are most often the least of our brothers and sisters in society, addicts, people with mental disorders and other people who for some reason are on the street.
"Addiction is a harsh taskmaster, and somehow the next dose must be financed. Unfortunately, theft of such liquid assets is an easy way to that goal," says Bjartmar.
My interactions with these people are actually so good that I have many of those good people on my team.
There are examples of people who have gone into treatment and improved themselves and then sought me out and helped me with what I am doing," he says.
Generally, Bjartmar's interactions with cyclists are on a courteous note.
Some know about him and what he's doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, bicycle frame numbers and so forth.
Bicycle theft is a major issue that has received little attention.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police have even started pointing people in his direction regarding stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the previous news coverage by DV and says he is not some sort of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked whether he is now nonetheless on thin ice with his behavior, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says that is certainly the case.
Of course, the police are supposed to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are simply not taking care of this.
For instance, I have seen police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen bikes.
She is simply powerless in these matters.
"When the police are not doing anything about this, and it's just right in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can achieve results in this area, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He says he has had so much success in finding stolen bikes that sometimes he runs into his "clients" on the street, and then they just give Bjartmar the bikes that they had previously acquired.
The times when Bjartmar has called for police assistance, it has happened that they simply do not show up.
"This just isn't working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the bicycle owners' fault," said Bjartmar, finding it unfortunate that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer due to the police's inaction in this area.
There is no dispute about Bjartmar's success.
Everywhere, stories can be found of people thanking Bjartmar for having their possessions returned to them.
Bjartmar himself says he has long since lost count of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts surely run into millions, if not tens of millions.
Electric mopeds, electric bikes, and electric scooters weigh heavily there, but an electric bike can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a kindergarten during the day and every other weekend he works at a group home.
His search for bicycles is therefore unpaid work that he attends to in his free time.
Pension Funds and Long Shadows
The year 2019 was a significant anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had indeed received a pension from the King of Denmark all the way from the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for officials was established, which eventually became the pension fund for all public employees.
The foundation for the current pension funds of general wage earners was then established with comprehensive wage agreements in the labor market in 1969, where employment-related pension funds with mandatory membership and full-fledged fund accumulation from the beginning of 1970 were stipulated.
In 1974, laws were enacted based on these agreements, and the pension system continued to strengthen after that.
The pension system for wage earners was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century drove forward through its struggles for better wages and conditions.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar manner in the historic strike disputes of 1955, and the associations also gradually succeeded in advancing their demands for sick leave rights and health funds, substantial vacation rights, reduction of working hours, improvements in housing issues, and more such matters of great importance.
All these rights came at the cost of a great and strict struggle but proved, in hindsight, to be a much greater and more lasting improvement in living standards than the increase in coins in the wage packet, which immediately disappeared into the pit of inflation that characterized the period after the war and up until 1990 as many remember.
The lead-up to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although it was eventually agreed that the funds would in fact be owned by the fund members, the labor movement had to agree that their boards would be appointed with representatives of employers and fund members equally.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers on the boards of the funds was often discussed in labor unions, but it never came to pass, and therefore we still have the unnatural situation where representatives of the fund members are not in the majority on the boards of the funds.
Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on mandatory insurance of pension rights and the operation of pension funds discusses the investment strategies of the funds.
The first clause states that "a pension fund shall have the interests of fund members as its guiding principle."
Also, paragraph 5 states: "A pension fund shall establish ethical guidelines for its investments."
In the shareholders' policy of the Commercial Employees' Pension Fund, among other provisions, following the aforementioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a signatory to the United Nations (UN PRI) Principles for Responsible Investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors from across the Atlantic and in Europe.
In the rules, it is discussed how an emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance, can contribute to improved investment performance of securities portfolios.
Thus the interests of investors and the goals of society at large go hand in hand.
LV believes it is important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, establish a public policy on: adhering to good governance, working conditions, social responsibility, and environmental issues.
The pension fund Gildi, which is among the largest funds in the country, has established a "policy on responsible investments" and therein are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all revisited here as an introduction to the latest buzzword in Icelandic, "shadow governance".
Where the term is new in the language, it’s not expected that it has been fully defined, but what seems to be the "most accepted" definition now is: Shadow governance is when a union leader announces in the media that they intend to send recommendations or directives to the union’s representatives on the pension fund board on how they should position themselves on a specific issue.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be asked to step down from the board at the first opportunity.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about resignation, then it is however not "shadow governance," as such communications between people are of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I leave it to the reader to ponder which path they find "more ominous."
Particularly, there are two men who have tried to shape this definition when this is written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
Those are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, the governor of the Central Bank.
The reason for both was after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and cabin crew (lay them off), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Commercial Workers' Union, then sent out recommendations to the union's representatives on the board of the Commercial Workers' Pension Fund not to support the fund's potential purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they might be asked to step down.
Some time later, Bogi Nils retracted his decision and subsequently, Ragnar Þór followed suit with his recommendations, which were of course based on Bogi's decision.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to expound on the matter in the Friday edition of Fréttablaðið with grandiose words about shadow governance, legal violations, and a strong need for changes in legislation.
There, a small mound truly had to overturn a heavy load although the blessed mound had been in subjunctive mood, and moreover, had been quickly dried out.
As the matter is important, let us consider the substance itself in the end.
I have previously outlined the points in the pension fund law that relate to this matter.
The essence of this is that fund managers must protect the interests of the fund members and maintain ethical standards in investments, and these matters are further elaborated in the regulations of both Gildi and the Commerce Employees' Pension Fund, as I mentioned.
Pension funds, however, should NOT focus solely on short-term profitability objectives in their investments.
Such a policy would indeed be extremely dangerous and one does not have to look far for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have flowed to immoral adventurers and environmental vandals, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on thin ice when he considered wiping out an entire group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the goodwill the company had enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position with investors.
Fortunately, he realized his mistake and retracted it.
Time will reveal whether it suffices for the pension funds' investment in the company to be considered responsible towards the members in the end.

One of the infected individuals did not adhere to quarantine after returning home
One of the three who were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from a Baltic state on the 15th of July last, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who is not permanently residing here and therefore did not receive clear instructions about maintaining so-called border screening and testing upon arrival in the country, and to have another test taken a few days after arrival.
He received a negative result from the screening at the border.
"But he is in Icelandic society and should really go into that measure," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a specialist in the field of infection prevention at the Directorate of Health and the deputy chief epidemiologist while he is on summer vacation, in a conversation with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the national ID number, and if the national ID number is not registered, then you are not automatically summoned for the second sample."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually residing abroad, but due to his network of connections in the country as an Icelander, he should have rather used the Icelandic one.
He did not realize this, however.
"When the national identification number is not registered, you need to take the initiative to come for the second sampling."
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
"So it is clear that we need to enhance the information dissemination about this while we find some way to implement an automated notification system even though Icelanders do not register their social security number."
Or to somehow make it more obvious who the participants in the Icelandic community are in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, the individual had limited contact with others upon arrival in the country, although he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six have been sent into quarantine after he was diagnosed yesterday, and these six were all in contact with him.
They have yet to go for sampling, but two of them have started showing symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative result from his sample collection at the border on July 15th.
Kamilla says it is likely that he was so recently infected with the virus that it could not yet be detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
She does not want to rule out the possibility that the man was infected here in Iceland and did not bring the virus with him to the country.
"It is not entirely possible to assert that this is definitely an imported infection because it has been so long since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here just like these two who have caused a bit of a stir in connection with the sports events."
She says, however, that it's very unlikely because of how few people the man interacted with here.
"It is actually very unlikely," says Kamilla, but notes that it cannot be ruled out until deCODE Genetics has finished sequencing the virus in the person.
"If we get a virus strain that has not been seen here before, then it is almost certain that he has brought it into the country."
Pepper spray and explosives used against protesters
Clashes occurred between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and non-lethal grenades on protesters, but protesters broke windows and started fires.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested against widely in the United States last night, with the protests in Seattle being in support of the protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot to death.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands came together in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
The police subsequently described the protests as riots and clashes occurred between groups of protesters and police.
Justice demanded In Aurora, Colorado, protesters commemorated Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police in August last year.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the Black National Guard came together to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was killed by police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and marched in formations to closed intersections where police separated the group from a crowd of people who were protesting the protests and also carrying firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters commemorated James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of today's game against Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United lose the match, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, Solskjær and his men will finish in 5th place and thereby miss out on a Champions League spot.
Then they would still have hope of qualifying for the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
"We have not reached the final destination."
If we get a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad season," said Solskjær.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have quite a bit to go to catch the two teams above us," said Solskjær.
It is clear that people's nerves will be on edge at 3 pm today, but Solskjær tried to act as if it were just another game.
"If someone wants to belong to Manchester United, then one has to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season."
This is nothing new, and the company is based on this.
We have created a fantastic opportunity for ourselves to end the season well and now it is up to us to take advantage of it,” said Solskjær.
"This is not the most important game of the season, it is just the next game."
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our season, we have already had many moments that define this season.
"The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I think that overall we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than last season," said Solskjær.
65,000 infections in 24 hours
65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were identified in the United States yesterday according to Johns Hopkins University.
In total, 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed overseas since the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, but for the last four days leading up to that, the deaths from the virus were more than 1,000 per day.
In total, 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a CNN report, the US health authorities' predictive model expects the number of deaths caused by the virus to reach 175,000 by the upcoming August 15th.
Fear the second wave of the epidemic
Authorities in Spain are now trying with feeble effort to hold back the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, on both Thursday and Friday.
There have not been more diagnosed in one day since the beginning of May, and the reports come at the same time as the Spaniards start to lift one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.
The setback led to British authorities now requiring passengers from Spain to quarantine upon return.
A week before, Spain was on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is at its worst in Catalonia in the northeastern part of Spain, where the authorities have resorted to more extensive restrictions in an attempt to curb the growth.
In the capital Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and pubs must close at midnight.
Then a curfew is now in effect for 200,000 residents in the Segria region in the western part of Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision of the British will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and has been badly hit by the pandemic.
Tui, the largest travel agency in the UK, has canceled all flights that were scheduled for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Authorities around the world are said to be preparing for a second wave of the pandemic, but there seems to be little interest in resorting again to the extensive lockdowns that have devastated economies everywhere.
For instance, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reacted very negatively to such an idea, comparing it to a nuclear weapon that he would not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, the Prime Minister of France, has said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if a nationwide curfew were imposed again.
Many policymakers hope that local measures which reach the residents of individual towns, cities, or regions will be sufficient to curb the virus in the next round if it occurs.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three local
Three domestic infections were identified yesterday in addition to two more at the borders.
Yesterday in Iceland, five individuals were diagnosed with a positive Covid-19 infection.
In a statement from the Civil Protection Agency, it is reported that one infection is linked to the infection identified yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
Has he been sent to isolation and the sixteen who were in close contact with him to quarantine.
The infected was a participant in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavik and according to the announcement, "only part of the sports team" is in quarantine.
Others who were sent into quarantine are connected to the man in another way.
The origin of this infection has not been found, and contact tracing is in full swing by the National Police Chief's contact tracing team.
The organizers of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the guidelines and rules of the epidemiologist and civil protection that are still in effect, and appropriate measures have been taken.
Although images from the match yesterday drew attention because you could see very close interactions celebrating the good performance of their team out on the field.
Just before 11 am today, the organizers published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
Note: Parents, please respect the rules that competitors must retrieve their own stuff at the school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.
Another infection was detected yesterday but it is related to the infection that was reported the day before yesterday.
The announcement states: "deCODE genetics has sequenced the infections and a new type of virus has been identified which has not been detected here before."
Efforts are being made to trace the infection in that case as well, and the infected individual is in isolation and 12 are in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who came to Iceland eleven days ago, on July 15th.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already showing symptoms of viral infection.
Additionally, two were diagnosed at the border and awaiting results from further investigations as the protocol for infections at the border dictates.
Finally, the statement says: The Civil Protection Department of the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police and the Directorate of Health emphasize the importance for individuals to exercise caution and pay close attention to their personal infection prevention measures.
If there is the slightest doubt whether symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the person in question is asked to go for testing at the nearest healthcare center.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite is fully booked for the Merchants' Weekend - Redirects guests elsewhere
The campsite at Patreksfjörður is fully booked for the weekend, according to an announcement from Vesturbyggð.
Guests are advised to look at other accommodation options.
Vesturbyggð names Bíldudal, Tálknafjörð, Melanes on Rauðasandur, Hótel Flókalund and Hótel Breiðavík as alternative options in the situation.
There is plenty to do in Patreksfjörður this weekend, as like previous years, Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic documentaries, will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has thus become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging by the interest in the campsite, we can expect good attendance this year, if the weather does not spoil the plans, as DV reported earlier today about an unfavorable forecast.
The worst weather can be expected in the south, with hope for the people of Patreksfjörð.
The website bb.is was the first to report it, saying that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
An entire apartment building crumbles down in the best location in the city.
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhaga 18–20.
While owners seek building permits for renovations, their application has been winding through the system for going on three years.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts of Reykjavik city stands a substantial multi-story building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square meters of retail space.
Behind the house are doors to two stairwells, each containing four rather substantial apartments.
They range from 93–130 square meters, although most are over 100.
The house has a considerable history to contain.
It was built in 1959 and has among other things housed a video rental, Skóstofan, the dairy shop of Mjólkursamsalan, Jói the gunsmith, a fish market and most recently Háskólaprent.
The house, to put it mildly, has seen better days.
The house now lies heavily damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
According to the company registry, among others, the owners of D18 ehf. are Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús led the group of owners of Borgun and was the representative of the holding company of Borgun.
Among the owners of the holding company Borgun is Stálskip ehf.
Steelship Ltd. is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a one-third share in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once operated the fishing company Stálskip.
D18 Ltd. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore barely been maintained since then.
Neighbors say that the condition of the house has steadily deteriorated since then, especially in recent years.
On the neighborhood's Facebook page, one resident says the house has "not been particularly lively in recent years."
There may be a factor that for several years, the owners have been seeking to alter the house and the land.
Other neighbors say the house has not been alright for a long time.
"It's long overdue to do something proper with this spot and it's annoying that it has been delayed like this."
He also says that he is angry with the owners of the house for not having pushed themselves to finish this, to find some common ground with the neighbors of the house and to stop this “legal charade.”
"Just do this in consultation with the surrounding community so that it can be expedited and completed."
The "legal quagmire" the resident refers to is the planning process for the site which has been underway at least since 2017.
Then, the owners of Dunhagi 18 and 20 applied for permission to construct a floor on top of the existing apartment building, and behind the house, a new elevator shaft and an extension of one floor plus a basement.
The building permit granted for that project was appealed to the Environmental and Resource Affairs Appeals Committee, and the committee invalidated it as the project was not based on a detailed plan, and the neighborhood notification was not satisfactory.
The City of Reykjavik then initiated a detailed planning process, which was completed with an announcement in the Official Gazette in July of the previous year.
The arrangement was also appealed and the committee revoked it in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the house at the starting square.
The house had by this time deteriorated significantly and the neighbors had begun to get tired.
When DV asked the neighbors about the condition of the house and the neighbors' reactions, the answers varied.
Some understood the intentions of the house owners, others not at all.
Others directed their anger towards the city, others did not.
Others were just angry but not necessarily at anyone in particular.
Yet others called the parking spaces a bone of contention, but neighbors have utilized the unused parking spaces at Dunhaga 18–20 for their vehicles.
One complainant in the case said they were tired of the bureaucracy:
"That we have to go through the process three times is absolutely incredible."
"It's like the City of Reykjavik doesn't know how to read."
Today the house stands empty, abandoned, and is neglected.
A memorial to the city administration's efficient governance and the noble intentions of the owner and the years of work by those who are now at the starting square.
When the journalist arrived at Dunhaga 18, he was met with wide-open doors and piles of rubbish.
A PlayStation console and a recent-model television lay among other rubbish on the ground — victims of the Icelandic summer rain.
The door was open to the old office of University Press, and from the smell of urine, there were quite a few cats inside.
It is clear that someone has made themselves at home in one corner, but no one is visible.
Piles of sofas and beds and a few shelves of geological pages, which were no doubt intended to become a book, were on display.
The stairwells of the apartment building were also open and there was life in both of them.
A journalist was so lucky to come across a resident of one of them.
There were Romanians boiling a potato dish for dinner and they invited a reporter inside.
The Romanians work for the staffing agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and sources of DV claim that the company has not paid anything for the housing except for heating and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not considered justifiable to collect rent.
Judging by the piles of mail in the lobby of the building, it's clear that a number of foreign workers have lived there over the past few months.
The operation of temp agencies has not been unaffected by the Covid-19 situation, with the contraction in tourism leading to a contraction in the construction industry, and these two sectors have been the most diligent in utilizing the services of temp agencies.
Nevertheless, the residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do, and the work coveralls and mittens hung in the communal area to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the wretched condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be fairly well maintained.
When the journalist waved goodbye to the Romanian boys, the irony suddenly became clear to him: In the best location in Reykjavik stands a 1,500 square meter property, run down.
The owners want to improve the house and neighbors want better conditions but disagree on the definition of "improvement".
Between sits the city's planning division at the starting square, a victim of endless appeal routes and complaint options in the planning process and the sluggish resolution of the Environmental and Natural Resources Complaints Committee.
In the house, Romanian workers live, perhaps precisely those who will work on improving the condition when the Icelanders stop quarreling.
The article originally appeared in the DV weekend paper on July 17th.
In an effort against obesity following the coronavirus pandemic
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds for a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on fast-food advertisements, following his serious illness, which was partly due to his weight.
Johnson is set to introduce the campaign, titled Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, with the campaign encouraging doctors to prescribe cycling to their overweight patients, and will also launch an initiative to increase the number of cycling paths.
Then, fast-food advertisements on television will be banned before 9 p.m., according to sources from British media.
"COVID-19 has awakened us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active, and eat more nutritious food," a government spokesperson was quoted as saying.
Johnson himself has struggled with weight issues, and he was admitted to intensive care when he became infected with the coronavirus in the spring, and it is in part because of his weight that he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Women better suited to leading the changes
She said that the new constitution is the biggest step the nation can take towards more decentralization, transparency and in working against corruption and in the interests of the whole community.
We need to start shifting gears a bit now, and who is more suited to leading such changes than the group in society that finds it easier to be in these values.
"There are women," said Helga.
Women in Iceland are famous for their solidarity among women.
To stand together and be united in leading change.
So now it's just up to us to lead these changes.
She said she was a bit concerned about the emphasis on Iceland as "best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
Then we are not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
As Germans are very aware of their history and consider everything that needs to be done.
There's a lot of it.
We must know where we are coming from and know the history and listen.
Listening to the voices of marginalized groups.
"We don't all live by the same rules here," said Helga.
Asked, she said that women in many ways are in a good position in Iceland, but added that, like in many other places, Icelanders live with extremely male-dominated values.
She said that politics, for example, revolve around self-interest, domination, and power, which are the forces that maintain injustice in all societies.
"Women have now founded this group and come together and are just getting a bit irritated that the Althing intends time and time again to overlook this national referendum from 2012," she said.
"These are the feminine values that we are considering this from."
Based on human rights and environmental conservation, cooperation, and the fact that we are all truly sitting at the same table, she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the foundational values in the new constitution.
"We are a very rich country in natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people here living in poverty."
"It's ridiculous, we can exchange differently," said Helga.
"It's absurd that there's some natural law that women's jobs are always lower paid."
It is ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses constantly have to engage in wage battles just to earn decent wages.
You can sign the petition for the new constitution here through electronic Iceland.
Tried to rob a pedestrian in the downtown area
A man was arrested in the city center last night after he threatened a pedestrian and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of narcotics in Árbær, where two were arrested in connection with the case.
Then the police stopped a motorcyclist in the Hlíðar area where the rider was going at 146 km/h where the maximum speed limit is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his driving privileges.
The police in the capital area had plenty to do last night, and over 80 cases were recorded in the police log from five yesterday to five this morning.
Then there were especially many noise complaints due to parties.
During the eve of Saturday, reports of eleven noisy gatherings were received, and that was considered significant in the police log.
Tonight, however, police dealt with 22 noise complaints.
Six were detained in a cell overnight.
In Árbær, police were called out last night when individuals were shooting fireworks into the air.
They had already escaped by the time the police arrived.
Then nine drivers were stopped for drunk and or drugged driving.
Four were arrested for a brawl in the downtown area last night, but one of them was placed in a holding cell.
Then two were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one downtown and the other in the West Town.
One was taken to the emergency room after being injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who was pulling a caravan on Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to the police diary, the bicycle equipment of the trailer was in "very poor condition" and it was impounded.
Possible to stay in Monet's house over the Merchants' weekend
The house that the impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life in is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next available nights in the house are around the Merchant's Weekend.
The house is small and charming, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy in France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from the year 1883 until he passed away in 1926.
In the house, there are three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet first got the inspiration to paint his famous gardens at this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, they must rent it for at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb page, it is next available after a week, on the Sunday of Merchants' Weekend, and therefore it might be an ideal opportunity for any merchants on vacation to hurry up and book the painter's house.
The two nights over the Merchants' weekend cost only 964 US dollars or just over 130 thousand Icelandic kronur, according to what Fréttablaðið reports.
Ten in quarantine and several of them starting to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days, and most of those infected are unrelated.
Two have been placed in quarantine due to this and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday, and two at border screening.
An expert at the Office of the Chief Epidemiologist says that an increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in the community.
"The sequencing from the earlier domestic infection has been completed and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been lurking undetected in the community for some time."
This is probably something that has recently come to the country, but of course, we need to be very vigilant now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, a specialist in the epidemiological department of the Directorate of Health.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling will take place shortly, but several people who were in contact with those infected have started to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Now there is no influenza going on and fewer other respiratory infections, so we can be fairly liberal about doing these tests on individuals who during the flu season would have had reason to do something else first," said Kamilla.
Contact tracing is largely completed, but it is not excluded that more may need to go into quarantine.
Two of those infected were identified after attending a sporting event.
Has it raised questions whether it is justifiable to hold such events.
The communications manager of civil protection says it's quite possible as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
Kamilla says it's almost impossible that the infected got it from the sports events.
"If no more people go into quarantine from these individuals after having interacted with them at these sports events, then we can assert that our infection prevention measures at the competitions have worked."
But that has not yet come to light," said Kamilla.
The procedures of the civil protection department are under constant review.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if there appears to be a reason for it," said Kamilla.
After just over a week, plans are in place to expand the gathering restrictions to allow up to a thousand people.
This new situation could affect the relaxations.
"A certain meditation to cook" - See Elísa Viðar's menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an accomplished football player and plays with Valur.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day's hustle and usually takes the time to cook good and nutritious food.
A typical day for me starts with arriving at work around eight o'clock," says Elísa.
"After work, I go to the store so I can prepare dinner before I pick up my daughter from preschool at three o'clock."
Elísa finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter early from kindergarten.
"It's good to have time with her before I go to practice later in the afternoon."
After practice it's nice to come home and just have to heat up the food.
In the evenings, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch an episode to clear our minds.
Elísa does not follow any specific diet.
She is putting the final touches on her master's thesis in nutrition and therefore knows well what suits her to eat in order to have enough energy to attend to work, school, family, and training.
What suits me is to eat a varied diet that is well composed of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
I think it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to categorize food into bad or good, but rather nutritious or nutrient-poor.
It is actually okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.
Elisa has a very keen interest in cooking.
I find a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen cooking and therefore seek it out a lot.
I must say that my confidence is with me in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I am a decent cook.
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a bit of lemon juice, let sit in almond milk overnight.
Top this meal with whatever is available each time.
Typically it's a banana and granola & COFFEE.
I am a big coffee woman.
Small snacks: Incredibly varied, but fruit or vegetables, flatbreads, plain skyr with banana and muesli, bread with toppings, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon straight out of the container if it comes to that.
Lunch: I often make myself all sorts of hearty salads with whatever is in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel balls, rocket salad, roasted vegetables with a nice dressing is kind of what I am working with.
If the planning goes completely awry (which often happens), then the egg cooker at work has quite often been my savior, and then it's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese, and a boiled egg, don't take on more than that.
Snack: Get me something rich in carbohydrates before workouts, bread with toppings, cereal, or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often the choice at my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle
The municipal authorities in Seattle in the state of Washington have declared a state of emergency following large protests in the downtown area.
Police resorted to flashbangs and pepper spray yesterday in an attempt to clear a large area that protesters had occupied, which stretched across several blocks in the vicinity of the city's parliament building.
The police reported on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into vandalism carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly involving some sort of bomb.
City and police authorities say that protesters pelted the police with rocks, bottles, firecrackers, and other miscellaneous items, and one police officer was taken to the hospital where his injuries were attended to.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time at first.
The call was made for them to show solidarity with the protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there have repeatedly been violent clashes between protesters and heavily armed federal police squads.
There, as in many other cities in the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, remembering George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25th, protesting systemic racism in American society, and demanding reform.
Not revoked until after the vote
It is still not clear whether the layoffs of those Icelandair flight attendants, which are supposed to take effect at the next turn of the month, will be revoked.
The electronic voting for the collective bargaining agreement of the Icelandic Flight Attendant's Association on behalf of Icelandair flight attendants will end at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the chairperson of the association, says she is certain that Icelandair will not make a decision on the dismissals until the result of the vote is clear.
"This clearly hangs together," says Guðlaug Líney.
No layoffs have been rescinded, this needs to be clarified so that the machines can be staffed.
Of course, people are anxious to find out if they will have a job after the end of the month.
A vote is taking place on an agreement that was signed a week ago, on the eve of July 19th.
It is assumed that it will be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that flight attendants had previously rejected in a vote.
On July 17, the board and council of trust of the Icelandic Flight Attendant Association agreed to call a general strike at Icelandair, which was approved by the members in a vote.
She never came, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to cease negotiations with the Flight Attendants' Association, to lay off all of their flight attendants, and to seek agreements with another union.
Then the company's pilots were to take on the role of security guards on board temporarily.
Asked how she believes the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it's hard to predict.
"People are hurt after this assault by Icelandair, when all the company's flight attendants were laid off and notified that negotiations would be held with another union."
"Now it will be revealed whether it has an effect," she says.
940 flight attendants were working for Icelandair at the end of April, but then 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
Their notice period varies in length, for those with the shortest tenure it is three months and therefore ends at the end of July-August.
In that group, about 90% are Icelandair flight attendants.
What happens if the agreement is not approved?
We wish to continue negotiations with our counterparts.
With this agreement, we are meeting the demands of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that flight attendants think things have gone too far.
The vote on the collective bargaining agreement concludes and Icelandair will announce the second quarter settlement tomorrow.
The flight attendants' vote on a new collective agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's settlement for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary operating results indicate that the company's revenues have decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic voting on the collective agreement between the Icelandic Flight Attendant Association and the Confederation of Icelandic Enterprise regarding Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at 12 noon.
Those who may vote on the agreement are employees of Icelandair who pay union dues to the Flight Attendants Association.
Icelandair and the Icelandic Flight Attendants' Association (FFÍ) signed a new collective bargaining agreement in the early hours of Sunday, July 19th, but the preceding Friday, Icelandair had broken off talks with the union after flight attendants overwhelmingly rejected a previous agreement in a vote at the beginning of July.
Then Icelandair had given notice to all the company's flight attendants and cabin crew on Friday, but those were withdrawn after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to the new collective agreement, flight attendants have to fly five more hours per month for the same base salary.
The collective agreement is valid until 2025, but it has integrated provisions for pilots and flight attendants regarding how long one may fly in a single shift.
The agreement was presented to the members of FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and many flight attendants expressed their dissatisfaction with the agreement when spoken to by the news agency.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the agreement had to be approved in order to keep the FFÍ alive.
Icelandair's settlement for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the company's EBIT, its operating performance before financial items and taxes, is according to preliminary operating results negative by 100 to 110 million US dollars, or about 15 billion Icelandic krona.
Icelandair sent provisional calculations to the Stock Exchange last Wednesday, which stated that the company's revenues amounted to about 60 million dollars for the quarter, or about 8.3 billion krona.
Cash and cash equivalents were about 154 million US dollars at the end of the quarter, around 21 billion kroner.
Icelandair also aims to offer the company's share capital in August.
Icelandair aims to finalize agreements with fifteen creditors, authorities, and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before proceeding with a share offering.
A new variant rather than a new species of virus
"A new virus just means that this has been an individual who came from abroad."
This is not something that has been brewing domestically," says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at the Infectious Disease Department of the National Hospital, about the news that "a new type of virus" has been detected in the country.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One of those diagnosed had participated in the social activities of a sports club at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the infection is unknown and contact tracing is ongoing.
Also, an infection was diagnosed in an individual who arrived in the country on July 15, and two people who were in contact with him have started to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, an infection was diagnosed that is linked to an infection identified the day before and after sequencing by deCODE Genetics, it was revealed "a new type of virus that has not been detected here before."
Contact tracing is completed in relation to that infection.
Már points out that this is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e., the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to talk about a new variant of that virus rather than a new species of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could indicate that a second wave of the epidemic has begun, Már says that currently it is an isolated incident and it might turn out that nothing more comes of it.
"But on the other hand, if cases arise domestically that have no connections from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then it would be possible to draw the conclusion [about a second wave] but it is premature at this point," explains Már.
The happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to Icelanders' happiness hidden in the hot pots?
Program makers at the BBC suggest in an entertaining video that sheds light on the country's swimming pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bathing culture is unique in the world, and it is claimed that nowhere else on earth are there as many bathing places per capita.
The natural geothermal heat is the basis for it, but also the tradition for swimming that prevails here.
Swimming lessons for children became mandatory in 1940, but older citizens are no less diligent in using the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming excursions are described as a regular part of the country's general welfare.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and status.
Free from cell phones, people engage in personal conversations about everything under the sun or enjoy the soothing power of the water: meditating and recharging the batteries of soul and body.
Heading into a hundred days until the election
There are a hundred days left until Americans go to the polls and elect a president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking reelection, but he has a steep hill to climb.
Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has a significant national lead over Trump, according to polls.
According to a new AP news agency survey, a record number of Americans believe that the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the new coronavirus pandemic is also very unpopular, and moreover, more Americans than before believe that the president has handled economic matters poorly.
More specifically, only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the pandemic, and 48 percent say he has handled economic matters well.
In March, the percentage was 56 percent and in January, it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden's national support is 49.9 percent while Trump's support is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention from his performance regarding the pandemic to Biden, pushing so-called cultural conflicts and advocating policies related to law and order.
Biden's campaign, however, is very focused on keeping the attention on Trump and believes there is a high probability of victory if the election truly revolves around how Trump has performed in office over the past four years.
Trump's unpopularity also seems likely to affect the Republican senators, and those at the forefront fear that the Democrats could even gain a majority in the US Senate, which has until now seemed very unlikely.
Politico recently reported that if the current support for parties and candidates remains the same, the Republican Party would suffer its worst defeat in decades.
Suburbs proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections, and now it seems that this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare suburban residents into following him, among other things, by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will ruin the suburbs of the United States and encourage racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has repealed a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
Then he encouraged the "housewives" of the suburbs of the United States to read an article by the former assistant governor of New York, in which she argued that Biden would destroy the suburbs of the United States, and Trump agreed with that.
"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream."
I will preserve it, and even make it better!" said the president.
Residents of the suburbs of the United States are an ever-growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of votes from this group has become president.
Except in the year 2012 when Mitt Romney received the majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that although Trump secured a narrow majority in the suburbs in 2016, his support there has significantly decreased.
Though it varies between polls, Biden has recently measured about a fifteen-percentage point lead over Trump in the predictions.

Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that until now only world wars had interrupted, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famed Olympic flame would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," presumably referring to the global coronavirus pandemic that the world is currently navigating together.
Outstanding individuals have an extra year to prepare and Japanese authorities bear the cost of the delay.
Everyone keeps their head though a lot is at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for this year's Olympic Games, the Japanese representatives' rejoicing was genuine.
They cried and laughed in turns because Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 games but was that time defeated by Rio in Brazil.
This time Tokyo City and Japan were to bathe in the world's attention.
The games were supposed to take place from July 24th to August 9th but have been postponed for a year and will instead start on July 23rd, 2021, and end on August 8th.
If it is not possible to hold the games then, if the coronavirus is still too much of a threat, the games will be canceled.
No one really wants to think that thought through to the end.
The Olympic Games are no ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is spared, the show must always be spectacular and strives to outdo the last performance.
The choice of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the evaluation committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.
The more spectacular the presentation — the greater the chance of winning the prize.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars in trying to host the 2016 Olympic Games, which is equivalent to over 20 billion kroner.
For the second time, when applying for the 2020 Games, 75 million dollars, about ten billion krona, were put into the promotion.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the games this year, Japanese authorities had already spent an amount equivalent to 30 billion krona on the project.
Yet that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of constructing an Olympic Village, stadiums, and generally strengthening the country's infrastructure to handle such an event, preparing for it, and hosting the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be underway these days but have been postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
In a report from the national auditor in Japan that was released at the end of last year, it was revealed that the cost was nearly double that figure.
It will probably not be possible to fully assess the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two to six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run in the range of 15 to 30 billion dollars.
There are such high figures that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state would only suffice for just under half an Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they often become the subject of economists, who try to scrutinize the numbers and examine the benefits and gains of the games.
In a nutshell, quite a few people seem to have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympic Games is less than positive for the economies of the cities that host them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, job opportunities increase substantially for a short period, but over the long-term, cities often end up with a burden of debt and the threateningly high operational costs of underused facilities.
Rio in Brazil is left with significant debts due to the 2016 games and has had trouble financing the maintenance of all the large sports facilities that were built for the games.
A close look has been taken at the figures following the 2012 London Games and it has been revealed that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
It means that there were no new jobs except to a small extent.
Generally, cities have not fared well financially from hosting the Olympic Games due to the overwhelming cost associated with the infrastructure built for the games.
However, the benefit is often considered to be in the increased flow of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the games, although there is great uncertainty about this regarding the 2021 games.
It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to accommodate all the spectators who usually attend the games.
The main thing, however, is the honor that the cities receive by being chosen, but it is difficult to quantify in terms of money.
Because despite the enormous expense, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not such that it can be priced.
But although the show is often grandiose and no expense is spared, this is obviously not just about money.
It is the sports heroes who are in the forefront.
For some athletes, it's actually just a welcome opportunity to postpone the games.
The Australian modern pentathlete and gold medalist in her event at the last Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, is, for instance, pregnant and would have been far from ready to compete this summer but she is hopeful to be in competitive shape for the 2021 games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather pleased with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For the athletes who intended to retire after this year's games, if they had been held at the right time, the postponement of the games means that in some cases they will quit competing before the games take place.
Simply do not trust their body to go through another year of intense training.
Few athletes managed to endear themselves as thoroughly to the hearts of spectators at the Rio 2016 Olympics as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold medals around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in her home country, the United States, recently to discuss the Olympic Games.
She is aiming for the 2021 games but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top in next year's games, especially since she will be 24 years old by then.
While it's generally not considered old age, it's on the higher side for a top-tier female gymnast.
"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but still smiles in a different direction in an interview that was published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked whether she intends to go as far in the 2021 games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I simply do not know if I will still be at the top after another year of training," says Biles.
She has previously talked about how her body cannot handle the stress associated with gymnastics training much longer.
Nevertheless, she trains diligently for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling having to suddenly stop practicing when the pandemic was at its peak and the gymnastics hall was closed.
No exceptions were made for Biles any more than for others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold couldn't buy her any access beyond the others; she had to find various ways to keep fit just like everyone else.
The basic form is certainly a bit better than most people's.
We have a tight schedule now.
It was difficult to start practicing again after the gym reopened.
We started slowly but are now back to full speed and I will gradually increase the workouts as the year progresses.
We obviously don't know exactly how these games will turn out or whether they will be held, but we still practice assuming that they will be; we can't do otherwise.
"I have put too much effort into the sport to give it up now," says Biles.
Like her and others, there is a doubt or perhaps rather an awareness that the situation might arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
Predicting it, however, is hopeless.
No one can know what the situation with the coronavirus pandemic will be like in July 2021 and there is nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics assuming that they will be held that year.
Perhaps the Olympic Flame will be the light at the end of the Covid-tunnel.
Postponed wedding due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now," said the actress in a conversation with People.
"We definitely want to get married sometime and have the dream wedding with all those who are dear to us in attendance."
But we decided to postpone it and focus on what's important right now, which is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I am more focused on world affairs than on wedding matters these days.
There is a lot going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world.
