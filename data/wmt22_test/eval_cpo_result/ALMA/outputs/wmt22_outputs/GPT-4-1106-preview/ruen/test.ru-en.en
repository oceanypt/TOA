From my point of view, the literature program was shaped by ladies of Balzacian age based on their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the perspective of those very ladies of Balzacian age.
The psychology and the torments of Tolstoy's and Turgenev's heroines are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are generally rarely interested in the psychology of the characters.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to depict a certain variety of them?
There are roses of such a color and with such a petal structure, resembling velvet, typically dark red, burgundy shades.
The light roses look different; their petals have a satin or silky sheen.
Sharks attack surfers, mistaking them for turtles...
Bulls are somewhat colorblind.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige mattress 105x195.
Model "Micropackage Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different firmness on each side: the medium-firm surface is made of latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, while the moderately soft side is made of natural latex sheet.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeper's body, preventing the occurrence of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the virtues of the model, it is necessary to highlight breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is naturally well-ventilated, as is coconut coir.
This helps to maintain a healthy microclimate of the sleeping area.
The mattress is also covered by an extended warranty period.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, but the actual service life of the mattress is longer.
Dust and contamination protection is provided by a removable jacquard cover included in the set.
Purchase an orthopedic pillow to go with your mattress - it is recommended for maintaining the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, while latex relaxes the muscles.
Turn on your brain and chase away such little relatives!
It's better to have none at all than such...
Either look for an external driver or someone who is willing to invest and work with you as a partner.
If it doesn't work out, then sell the car, even at a loss, don't feel sorry for it.
Next time you'll think better...
Andrey, it has been clearly explained to you that retirees work at schools, they will not work in the command line.
The computer science teacher won't be able to help either, they didn't teach him that, school kids play games on Windows.
So there is no support whatsoever.
I remember those feasts and guests at my parents' house with horror.
Guests are at the doorstep, and the cutlets are still being fried on the stove, mom's flustered finishing washing the floor.
Lord, he sat down at the table already without strength.
And then wash the dishes and clean the house.
A week before the holiday you haul groceries, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning up after.
And what about the guests?
They are doing well, and they must also bring a cake with them.
Ever since then, I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my own family, I set the table with the bare minimum.
And I cook them delicious treats, I bake very often just because.
Germany: The fourth vaccination against coronavirus is inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will probably be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners Ulrich Weigeldt is convinced of this.
The newspaper Die Welt reported this on Saturday, December 11.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be needed in summer, at the latest in autumn," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with flu vaccination".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition to that, enhanced vaccination may help combat the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omicron".
This new variant is particularly dangerous.
Yes, the likelihood of reinfection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of the preliminary research conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omicron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
Research by BioNTech and Pfizer has shown that with two doses of the vaccine, the efficacy is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For instance, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates for reducing the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, as Zaltzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will affect the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience very convincingly demonstrates this," the expert emphasized.
Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the company Pontoon21®.
She (like the Kalikana Vib series) is different from many other vibes in that it was originally designed with ice fishing in mind, not just for casting.
These vib lures have a higher specific weight than their similarly sized counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top fin made of durable and flexible plastic, creating additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal retrieves.
As a "winter vibe" when vertical jigging, the Bet-A-Vib exhibits a rather aggressive action.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, movements with the fishing rod up and down with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very significant, which is convenient for fishing in confined spaces cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags, and other obstacles that could potentially snag the line.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for pikeperch and large perch in winter, and especially in mid-winter, when precise and aggressive lure presentation is required.
Having reached the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter fishing for pond trout.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
Also noted is that Bet-A-Vib through vertical jigging can tease a passive pike that doesn't react even to live bait.
When casting for distance, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is straightforward and not capricious; it pairs well with monofilament and braided lines even of larger diameters.
For casting pike, zander, ruffe, or perch, apart from a steady retrieve, the "step" method is also effective, occasionally with a "scraping" along the bottom.
If you're fishing in snag-filled spots, you can switch out the front treble for a double hook, which will reduce the likelihood of snags.
Among lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most stable in action and, consequently, one of the most catch-effective.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively shallow and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers are living off their elderly parents.
"Golden youth" - are clearly expressed slackers for the most part, incapable of and ignorant of anything.
A well-fed life leads to idleness.
Possibly, Mishustin had in mind this significant portion of the population.
You must be joking.
I've never seen any shoes in this store that I would want to buy.
What long-term sock are you writing about?
This shoe is made of faux leather.
It's good if it lasts one season.
"Zenden" is on the same level as "Kari".
Enter a couple or three times, take a look, and realize there's nothing to do in them.
In Libya, they reported about 7 thousand Russian mercenaries.
In Libya, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company "Wagner".
On Sunday, December 12, the statement was made by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner PMC mercenaries in Libya.
They have airplanes, too.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet planes at the Gardabia airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte),” Anadolu Agency quotes his words.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries "are attempting to capture" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "bring their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the interlocutor of the edition, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, according to the agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the "Wagner" PMC enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else could there be mercenaries
According to the agency, "Wagner" is presumably operating in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training of local forces, personal protection of leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies, and military services to these countries, the article states.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the CAR.
This group is not listed either in the power structures or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not present in the nominal rolls of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Let us remind you that earlier the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the Council of the European Union will approve this decision on December 13.
Situation in Libya
The High State Council of Libya de facto acts as the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions dominated by Islamists, reports TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the transfer of the single voting day for the election of parliament deputies and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left until the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," the report notes.
Against this backdrop, the High National Elections Commission of Libya has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
Examples of success - "protected in Syria, restored peace there", "decision on Nord Stream 2", "intimidated the whole world with awesome weaponry", "we took Crimea back".
The main failures are the "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", - states the study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper-based documentation - all government services have also gone fully digital.
The Dubai government has announced a complete transition away from paper documentation to digital technologies.
All state services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase in the digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," announced on Saturday the Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now the internal and external document flow in all government institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and utility services, the police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial entities also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and the digitization of document flow began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, authorities have calculated, 336 million sheets of paper have been saved, which equates to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Earlier, the Mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, talking about birthdates and the child's age, that's just nonsense, and about the class and group in kindergarten too.
I just can't believe that such scatterbrains exist.
And if they do exist, then they clearly don't care about anything, including their family.
My mother, her two brothers, and grandparents lived on 3 Vladimirskaia; it was a single-story house without bars.
They first knocked on the door, then on the window, then decided not to stand on ceremony, broke the window and climbed in, but the old man had a baseball bat, which they got a taste of.
These people knew for sure that there was someone at home...
Turkish car production and exports fell below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amidst the devaluation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's performance for the 11 months turned out to be worse than last year's results, reports Bloomberg, citing data from the Automotive Manufacturers Association of Turkey.
According to the association, in November, 115 thousand cars were produced in Turkey, which is 20% less than the previous year.
Approximately 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if following the results of the first 10 months of this year the automotive sector of Turkey demonstrated positive dynamics compared to last year, then following the results of 11 months of 2021, car production turned out to be 0.3% worse than the previous year's figure.
The reason for such a decline was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which depreciated by 29% against the dollar in November.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SME entities received a deferral on loan payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smaіlov spoke about the situation with providing benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports a correspondent of the MIA "Kazinform".
According to the information from the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year, following the instruction of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021, No. 127 "On Approval of the Procedure for Providing a Deferral of Payments on Loans for Small and Medium Business Entities" was adopted," Alihan Smailov wrote in his response to the parliamentary inquiry.
He reminded that the procedure for granting payment deferrals on loans provided that banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities would grant deferrals on payments for loans issued to small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), including sole proprietors, before April 1, 2021, for the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the SME entity.
In the borrower's statement, a different deferral period for payments could have been indicated.
During the deferment period, claims and litigation activity against the borrower were suspended, as well as the notification of the need to pay off overdue debt, and the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments," noted the deputy prime minister.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for loan payment deferrals from 603 SME borrowers, of which 553 SMEs were granted deferrals amounting to 9.7 billion tenge.
In the MFO, 131 SME entities applied for deferral, of which 95 entities were granted a deferral for a total amount of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity may easily tolerate the "Omicron" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems might tolerate it better than those who have a strong defensive reaction of the body.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the coronavirus strain "Omicron" might be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions in which the virus originated.
Scientists believe that "Omicron" originated in the body of someone infected with HIV or suffering from an immunodeficiency.
This means that upon mutation, it encountered no resistance from the immune system.
As a result, he is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no immune response, it became very fast.
It seems that it has more of these spike proteins, spikes, than it should, and its antibodies were not reduced during the mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems might experience "Omicron" more mildly than those who have a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong body response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
So it happens with pneumococcal infections when 30-year-old youths die, and 60-year-old elders get through it with just a sneeze.
The immune response is furious in the young; it's completely inadequate: where it would have been enough to just wag a finger, it attacks as if shooting sparrows with a cannon, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects, and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case often only the symptoms can be alleviated - all hope is on the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication in the body - this is fever, weakness, malaise.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, a sore throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left side, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, they may start vaccinating the younger generation aged 12 to 18 by the end of the year.
Virologist, head of the MIPT genomic engineering laboratory Pavel Volchkov noted that this category suffers very actively from COVID.
Teenagers attending school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, as are the pupils of kindergartens, - Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the genomic engineering laboratory at MIPT, told "Moscow 24".
Immense gratitude to the author for this article.
I was pleased to refresh my memories...
Education-In.
Back in those distant seventies and eighties, no dance floor was complete without the melodies of this band.
And at home, when getting together with friends, they would have dances to their music.
Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis on why people with obesity become victims of COVID.
The authors of the study examined adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and discovered that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected by the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, showing a strong inflammatory response in the process.
Scientists also studied the fatty tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and discovered coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in attempts to avoid the immune system's response.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this as well.
A biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Doctor of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin identified the causes of dementia and talked about ways of its prevention in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself with a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting even in familiar surroundings.
Golosheykin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a deficiency of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and the lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
Harmful habits also affect the development of dementia - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders, and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, an inability to concentrate, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"Discussions are ongoing that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," the biologist added.
To prevent the occurrence of diseases, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, practicing cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously a professor of the department of neurology, neurosurgery, and medical genetics at the Russian National Research Medical University.
N.I. Pirogov, the head of the Cognitive Impairment Department of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology, Anna Bogolepova, spoke about the reasons for memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30,000 artifacts illegally smuggled out of the country.
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return about 30,000 artifacts to their homeland, which were illegally smuggled out of the country.
On Saturday, December 11, the chief inspector of the department of returned antiquities of Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, Shaaban Abdel Gawad, announced this on the Al-Hayat TV channel.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to recover 29,300 artifacts.
"Just this year, 5300 artifacts of the ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gouad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out are registered in the archives.
Currently, the department's employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "monitor auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector explained that upon their return, the cultural valuables are restored and then displayed in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun that was sold at an auction in London.
On July 4th, Christie's auction house held a sale where a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (approximately 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally exported in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the guise of the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and had not been put up for auction since 1985.
The way in which the relic ended up in Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities that were illegally exported from the country at various times.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers."
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and that is correct, as the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (closely related to Turks).
If you want to add more, just 42,000 people - that's how many Tatars (from Kazan) live in Crimea (see the census).
Crimean Tatars are a distinct people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices.
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, reports Financial Times.
The point is that in Europe and the US, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, the bank may review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used for addressing business matters with colleagues or clients.
The bank reserves the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it for conducting a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used for work-related issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new policy.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was productive in terms of creativity, but extremely difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his ego.
He is already beyond any literary associations, has spat out imagism, he is on his own, but is well-known, in demand, at times harshly scolded by critics, even spitefully, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of which are true masterpieces, the "Persian Motifs" cycle was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, including the collection "Soviet Russia".
And the main success was that in late June of the 25th year, the State Publishing House signed a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
No contemporary poets have been honored like Sergey Alexandrovich, he is the first!
Moreover, this promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the factory director earned 300 rubles per month, an engineer - 200).
That year, the funds were needed like never before.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter, Sofia Tolstaya; it was necessary to set up family life, support his sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
Life seemed to be getting on track, there were reasons for joy, but for him, everything was predominantly colored in dark shades, as if a nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I myself don't know where this pain came from.
Or the wind is whistling
Over the empty and deserted field,
It's as if a grove in September,
Alcohol scrambles the brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had deteriorated greatly, looked unwell, and was clearly sick.
Binges are happening increasingly often, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was ever given to Sergey Alexandrovich by someone, no reliable documents have remained.
Let's say, concerning May 1923, when, upon the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, Yesenin was recovering his health at the clinic near Paris under Professor Pyotr Gannushkin (Yesenin would be treated by him again two years later, this time in Moscow).
And yet, there are plenty of testimonies to the poet's drinking binges, scandals arising from them, and incidents involving the police - scattered across dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the poet's frightful romance with the green snake rapidly evolved.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin settled for a short time with a friend, the Imaginist Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, despite his quite decent income, Esenin never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he lived in rented apartments, hotels, or with acquaintances.
The elder remembers:
He only came to stay the night, and in most cases, in an incoherent, drunk state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the stair landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and gasped.
Regaining consciousness, he began coughing incessantly, splattering the entire sheet with blood...
And even Yesenin himself, after his voyage through Europe and to the USA (where Prohibition was in place at the time, but Duncan had brought along a decent supply of alcohol), admitted:
I didn't see anything there except for taverns and streets...
I've reached the point where I've even stopped remembering people...
Well, and he drank, of course...
I drank because I was devoured by melancholy.

Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom Mattress 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom – a modern rendition of an economical model in the premium class range.
The base of the mattress is a block of independent double Duet springs.
Inside the large spring, a softer, smaller-sized spring is inserted.

It is possible to manufacture this model of mattress in a compressed version (vacuum roll-up packaging).
Now the son is almost 16, and he has long been free from the desire to act foolishly.
All energy is focused on choosing what he will do to earn a living.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age, or my husband, who had periodic run-ins with the law until we got married.
Father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love".
Why did the girl start crying during the exam, even though she hadn't failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it's not a school.
She will have a tail.
So what?
Will retake.
Millions of students know this.
What is this all about anyway?
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU.
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon"
Polish Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Paweł Jabłoński expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The Deputy Foreign Minister made the relevant statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he is "actively seeking new ways."
Also, the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world."
As the website kp.ru reported, the European Union previously introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic if the situation in the country does not improve.
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

Important to remember!
Prepare items for long-term storage: clean them and smooth out any creases.
Choose a case of the optimal size: things should not bend at the bottom.
It is not recommended to hang several bulky items in one garment bag at once: they can get wrinkled.
If you value tidiness and neatness, cherish your belongings, and wish to preserve them and extend their service life — order a garment cover.

"The cap does not fit Semyon": when a velvet jacket turns a man into a laughingstock
Velvet blazers dominated at social events in 2021.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashionable decision was Daniel Craig.
In September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet raspberry blazer and a traditional "Bond-style" bow tie.
Following his example, Prince William twice deviated from the royal dress code: first, he wore a green velvet jacket to The Earthshot Prize award ceremony, which was not in line with the traditional dress code, and later, he chose a more classic style for an event supporting the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messi also tried on the trend for himself.
The footballer came to collect his seventh Ballon d'Or in a Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already seeing a growing demand for velvet men's blazers in Russia.
According to the service's analysts, as reported by Gazeta.Ru, they started to be purchased 1.4 times more frequently.
The most popular are warm velvet blazers with lining and a tailored silhouette, the main colors being dark beige, burgundy, dark blue, and, of course, black.
The average price of such models ranges from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - they choose velvet suit sets less frequently.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet blazers are featured practically in all brands this season - including Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The Gucci model in which brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the movie "House of Gucci" is considered the most coveted.
When choosing jackets of expensive brands, one can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special thread interweaving technology, a dense fabric is created with a fuzzy exterior texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget-friendly options are made of cotton or polyamide, but, correspondingly, they last for a shorter time.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vahoshkin warns that when it comes to a velvet blazer, the main thing is not the model or cut, but the appropriateness.
Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you're heading to a party or a formal event, explains Vakhoshkin. It also suits those occasions when the invitation specifies a "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" dress code.
Another important criterion, the adherence to which allows a choice to be made in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first and foremost, should get the right kind of sophisticated crowd with means," claim the authors of the male fashion Telegram channel "Beau Brummell." "Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets."
They are simply invited to scheduled social events where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests pairing a velvet jacket with similarly dressy items: classic trousers with creases, solid-colored shirts, silk ties, tasseled loafers, cufflinks.
Too simple and ordinary things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Beau Brummell" are confident: it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to show up in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if it's about "a leader among those who are in charge of this event, then - "yes", such an item is suitable for him.
If an employee of a lower rank aims to climb higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to secure financial bonuses, then it would be better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate this with the phrase "the cap is not for Semyon's head," - believe the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings about the voice.
This is an unnatural timbre, it strains so torturously.
And it is not at all associated with the sweet face of a young girl.
Honestly, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But with all my heart, I wish you luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, meaning it's paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also not at a loss - gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
Every little bit adds up.
So who is out of luck then?
As usual - an ordinary customer.
Do the Indian's problems concern the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a decent fee.
I didn't see a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity among average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it off to the entire carriage, then most likely no one will sit next to them.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but definitely not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who realizes his servitude and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who does not realize his slavery and languishes in a silent, unconscious, and mute servile life is simply a slave.
A slave who drools when he smugly describes the delights of a slave's life and raptures about a kind and good master is a serf, a boor.
The immunologist stated that revaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the Omicron strain of the coronavirus.
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "Omicron".
Immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov made such a statement, calling vaccination in six months, considering the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period."
"With previous strains, this period was normal, but now it's best to conduct the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic illnesses - after four," the expert stated, calling for a revaccination campaign to be conducted in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination ensures a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or has had the disease and then been vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and then contracted the disease, then they have acquired 'hybrid immunity,' meaning they have plenty of antibodies and enough neutralizing ones," the expert clarified.
The G7 warned Russia of "massive consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
The "Group of Seven" countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France, and Japan) have issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It is emphasized that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have massive consequences and will be costly" for Moscow, but the specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the ministers of foreign affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers call on Russia to "de-escalate, utilize diplomatic channels, and adhere to their international commitments regarding transparency in military activities," which U.S. President Biden discussed during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with the aim of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the "Group of Seven" also stated.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
"Russia should have no doubts that further military aggression against Ukraine will have tremendous consequences and a serious cost in response," they warn.
We confirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our joint and comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, British foreign secretary Elizabeth Truss stated that Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting demonstrated "the unified voice of the 'G7' countries, which account for 50% of the global GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have massive consequences for Russia."
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective against the Omicron variant.
The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other strains of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who had received two doses of the COVID-19 drug.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, however, this ability was significantly reduced against the Omicron variant," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease progression when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the Omicron strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking NATO arms supplies to Kyiv.
Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kyiv's procurement of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles for taking down drones.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position regarding rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kyiv intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, the conversation concerns the USA, the UK, Lithuania, and France.
In the meantime, the FT notes that the position of the new German government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of authorizing arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect weapon deliveries from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany justified their refusal to supply weapons with the risk of military escalation of the conflict in Donbas, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of Ukrainian territory.
Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position, the diplomat is confident, even with a new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Kyiv expects assistance from Berlin in equipping the naval fleet.
In Ukraine, they are counting on Germany to "be Ukraine's partner in a technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chair of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated for the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.

Combined the living room with the kitchen.
The apartment has three rooms.
Was.
Certainly, the project, permission, new technical passport, all according to the law.
In the hallway, a bookcase and a large wardrobe were installed.
They closed off the door to the kitchen, and it freed up a bunch of space.
In almost 10 years of living in this apartment, we have never once regretted our decision.
From the mistakes - instead of a bathtub, they installed a cool shower cabin.
I regretted it a hundred times!

On the screen appeared a table showing what percentage of these semiconductors (apparently, chips-microcontrollers) each country produces.
Russia was not on this list.
Just like that!

I feel sorry for her, she lived her life in bitterness.
Mercedes filed a protest against the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix result.
The German team "Mercedes", whose driver Lewis Hamilton finished second in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix behind "Red Bull" racer Max Verstappen, has filed a protest against the final race result, according to a "Formula 1" press service.

In the first instance, the German team is challenging the decision of the judges to return the circuit racers one lap to the leaders.
According to the second - Verstappen overtook Hamilton before the permitted "restart" zone.
Let's add that the results of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, according to which Verstappen overtook Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the Formula 1 World Championship, are provisional, pending the consideration of Mercedes' protests, the timing of which is unknown.

Participants in the meeting also noted that they condemn the build-up of Russian armed forces at the country's border.

We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to abandon aggression towards Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).

Revealed methods for recovering money stolen through online stores
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not to become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were exposed by cybersecurity experts in a conversation with RBC.
Yes, to reduce the risk of significant losses if your bank card information falls into the hands of malefactors, it is recommended to keep the main funds on a card or bank account that is not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend getting a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases at stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, it is possible to initiate a refund procedure.
"Within the framework of the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility is placed on the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Artur Zaremba, emphasized that the customer has the right to submit a claim to the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition to this, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves refund the customer's money if the order has not yet been shipped.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, director of the Safe Internet League Ekaterina Mizulina reported that in 2021 alone there were 11 thousand inquiries about various fraud cases: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances may be the creation of a one-stop window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for negotiations dedicated to the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judicial authority in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream 2".
Although Scholz declared his aspiration to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years to come, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that he will urge Scholz to oppose "Nord Stream 2", which is intended to transport Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia could use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin announced that it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve this crisis.
The judicial system of Poland, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreements.
The European Court fined Poland after determining that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing "Law and Justice" party violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new government of Germany, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the USA, did not undertake any public commitments to stop the operation of "Nord Stream 2" in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior US Congressional staffer reported on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but on Wednesday Scholz warned of the consequences if Russia breaches Ukraine's border, and representatives of the "Big Seven" reaffirmed this position on Sunday.
Dmitry, look more carefully.
The view from the window is the same, the size of the window hasn't changed.
Removed the wall between the kitchen and the room, so the second window is partially visible.
Those who are not familiar with the initial planning have doubts.
And I know such apartments very well and can clearly see how it has been remodeled.
May everything be well for them.
It always surprises me when they write about the means to clean sinks, toilets, window sills, faucets.
Do you wash them just once a year on Easter or what? We have to scrub them clean.
Just don't let it get polluted.
The Ministry of Digital Development wants to endow writers with residencies
The state will transfer federal property, inherited from the Union of Soviet Writers and the USSR Literary Fund, to the Future Foundation for the Support of Russian Writers.
On its basis, writer residencies will be created, the Ministry of Digital Development, which will become the founder of the fund, told the "Parliamentary Newspaper".
The Ministry of Digital Development is preparing a draft presidential decree on the establishment of a Fund to support Russian writers.
The explanatory note clarifies that the foundation will be tasked with caring, among other things, for the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and the Literary Fund.
"A significant number of real estate properties previously owned by the Literary Fund of the USSR, including facilities located in the writers' village of Peredelkino, the settlement of Komarovo in the Leningrad region, and others, have been transferred to the ownership of the Russian Federation," the press service of the Ministry of Digital Development informed the "Parliamentary Newspaper".
The decree project stipulates that the Foundation's charter shall reflect that it "is established with the purpose of promoting literary activities by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers."
"By 'creating conditions for creative activities,' it is implied that writers' residences providing comfortable conditions for creativity will be established in different regions of Russia, based on the property being transferred," the Ministry of Digital Development explained to our publication.
520 rubles for one sliced tomato?
Cheese flatbread - is literally a dough sheet from a package for 550 rubles.

Doctors warned about the danger of prolonged use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination.
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergey Tokarev warned about the dangers of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after suffering from the coronavirus infection COVID-19 and before vaccination against the coronavirus.
Therapist, immunologist Irina Yartseva said that self-prevention of possible thrombus formation after COVID-19 can provoke a stroke.
Yartseva explained that anticoagulant medications are not for everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, stayed inpatient, and had complications identified.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood-thinning medications that prevent excessive blood clot formation) as indicated.
She reported that there is currently a prevalence of obscurantism - everyone is taking anticoagulants for an extended period, and as a result, they are experiencing complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (brain hemorrhages).
The chief preventive medicine specialist of the Ural Federal District, the scientific director of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Dr. Sergey Tokarev, in a conversation with URA.RU, said that Russians are now frequently using anticoagulants indiscriminately, even before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and begin to engage in self-medication.
There are some citizens who, a week before vaccination, start taking anticoagulants on their own decision.
During the preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruises.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medications without determining the cause of any symptoms.

The plumber who found money in the church wall will be paid $20,000.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the American state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This was reported in a press release from the nonprofit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in the large Lakewood evangelical church, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising that devout Christians can expect wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cauley was repairing one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of envelopes with money and checks hidden under the insulation.
He handed over the find to the church and, according to him, did not receive even a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say: 'You know, Justin, you made the right choice.'"
"We understand what you have done and what you could have done," - quotes him KPRC-TV.
Apparently, the discovery is related to a theft that occurred at the Lakewood church seven years ago.
At that time, about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in checks, which were kept in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was announced for information on the criminals.
Justin Couli could not claim this amount, as the reward period had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had initially offered a reward of five thousand dollars and later received an additional twenty thousand dollars as a gift from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber for his honesty.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Osteen regarding the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person".

It weighs more than four kilograms.
I want to make it tastier.
I want to find a recipe for chicken baked in pieces in beer.
Have you never tried this before?
Somehow I trust you more than just "Internet" recipes.
In China, a new case of human infection with the bird flu virus has been recorded.
A new case of human infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N6 has been recorded in China.
The radio station RTHK reported this, citing a notification from the Hong Kong health authorities, TASS reports.
A 68-year-old resident of the Huiyang district in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept poultry at home, became infected with the infection.
His condition is assessed by medical professionals as critical.
The world's first human infection with the H5N6 virus strain was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports upon entering the country.
In Brazil, it has been made mandatory to require COVID-19 passports from those entering the country, a decision issued by Luis Roberto Barroso, a judge of the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court (STF).
CNN Brasil reports about it.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Also, the list of exceptions includes individuals arriving from countries where the absence of the vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious when you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival, and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barroso noted.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities required tourists who are not vaccinated against coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
Scheme for complete protection against COVID-19 revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in a conversation with Ura.ru revealed the plan for complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and using a nasal vaccine.
When administered intranasally, a significant amount of immunoglobulin A is produced. This does not occur when the vaccine is administered by injection.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
Inside us, after vaccination, the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies) is produced.
And if you get both vaccines, you will have a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But so far there is no decision about the double vaccination," the medic said.
The chief preventive medicine specialist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in combination with the injectable one is the possibility to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that it would help in that case, the body's defense is supposedly to become maximal.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is exactly the situation that is observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I spoke to the male dog (who died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm home, regular meals, affection, love, and play for a female in heat, then go ahead.
But the poodle was trained and clever in general.
He chose my company and went home.
In the video is a method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not made up, believe me.
I stopped many owners from chasing after their dogs, even though they were upset, saying that there, 200 thousand was running away (Pomeranians), I literally took them by the hand and led them in another direction.
In the end, "200,000" was choosing the owner, not the little dog running around somewhere out there.
In Europe, mass protests by vaccination opponents continue unabated.
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the authorities' plans to make COVID vaccination mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated individuals will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the government's health policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held signs with the inscription "This is a false pandemic", "I will not get vaccinated".
A large protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covid certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
The authorities of several regions of the country decided to introduce health passports against the backdrop of an increasing number of coronavirus infection cases.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictions and QR codes.
The action started peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of protesters began to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even on Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as the "first Russian female doctor of medicine," probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I believe they both deserve the title.
I only agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans have only brought death and looting to any country where they appeared.

The WHO has detected "Omicron" in sixty countries already.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the new coronavirus strain "Omicron" has been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO report described the rate of spread of the strain.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has been identified in 63 countries across all six WHO regions.
Despite the fact that it only began to spread actively since the end of November.
The WHO also expresses concern about the high rate of spread of the new coronavirus variant.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in absolutely all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the Omicron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in Great Britain.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "Omicron" will displace "Delta" in the coming months.
And the number of sick people in Britain alone will be around 1 million. This is while officially only a few hundred people are currently suffering from "Omicron" in the Kingdom, and estimates are up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omicron" strain, with more than 2 thousand people being admitted to hospitals daily at the peak.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to latest studies, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine's effectiveness against the "Omicron" variant is 32 times lower compared to other strains of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Sputnik V" vaccine reacts to "Omicron" - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "Omicron" strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?
It would be better to SEE the execution of your exercises in more detail.
It's unclear in the first exercise whether to do it sitting on the heels or standing on the knees as written, but then how to brace your hands on the hips?
Hands on the waist?
Curious Squirrel, you are right, communicating on the Internet is completely different, people chat easily and relaxed, but when meeting in person, there is nothing to say.
Seeing the person in real life might not be what you expected, it didn't captivate you - hence the attitude.
When one meets their person, then their views will change.
And again, the Soviet era is called "the time of demons."
Back then, people believed in God much more sincerely than they do today.
Yes, and they were raised practically by God's laws (love thy neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
Today's ideology is money at any cost.
Gossips like Globa have little faith (if any at all), but even so, the time of demons came in the 90s...
Our communal apartment from St. Petersburg, more precisely Leningrad, on Bolshaya Zelenina still keeps in touch.
Certainly, we are not the closest of friends, but we strive to maintain the warmth of relationships from the older generation.
Maybe it's because there were no outsiders in the apartment, no rooms were rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was never canceled.
Unfortunately, we see each other more often at funerals.

Human offspring, especially males, are strong, agile, energetic, frolic, push, wrestle, and fight, just like their little "brethren" in the wild!
It's just a shame that they are not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, and scratches are common, and it's no boomerang at all!
And for what?
Did you push your little brother, not judging your own strength?
Are you always so nimble that you've never accidentally hurt anyone or injured yourself?

Both the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed significant growth during the period from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. Even more significantly, user spending in applications grew by 25%, up to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytics company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile application market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began post-pandemic recovery.
"Will such a 'return to the physical' slow down the growth of the app economy? Not at all," the report's authors believe.
India has become the leader in the number of app downloads, accounting for about 20% of all downloads.
The USA follows with 9% and Brazil with 8%.
iOS gadget users, as before, spent more than Android users: iOS accounted for 65% of all in-app spending.

The top 10 in terms of downloads also includes Telegram.
Overall, judging by the number of downloads, VPN services (two of which are in the top-10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and video creation and streaming services (besides CapCut and MX TakaTak, another two in the top-10 are Moj and SnackVideo) are popular among users.
"Users spent the most in apps for live broadcasts and online streaming," the report's authors note.
YouTube takes the lead here, and the top 5 in user spending also include the video service TikTok, streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.

The industries that helped people to be closer both virtually and personally achieved the greatest success," commented App Annie's Head of Marketing Insights, Lexi Sydow, on the report's findings.
The mobile gaming sector's revenue reached $90 billion in 2021. Casual and hyper-casual games, which have little or no storyline and minimalistic video design, were the leaders in the number of downloads.

Russians warned about a new scam scheme
Criminals have begun looking for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
The "Izvestia" newspaper writes about this with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's Product Director Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this, neural networks are able to accurately reproduce the behavioral characteristics of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that by using deepfake, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video or create a video with the person's copy for distribution with the intent of blackmail.
"These forgeries can easily provoke bullying, as a well-informed malefactor could place people in ridiculous, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
Varonis Senior Systems Engineer Alexander Vetkol noted in turn that psychologically, people tend to trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this could create specific risks in cases involving the use of video technology.
David, I will add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow for heavy makeup and wearing short skirts, showing off stockings and tights on one's legs.
This is a province, but the store HAD such a product.
In big cities, Muslim women also wore makeup and showed their thighs.
Here it is in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there is not enough of the same cosmetics.
Listed are five actions that will help avoid diabetes
Blood sugar level problems are some of the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a leading role in preventing the development of diseases.
Doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to plain water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods increase blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The occurrence of disease is affected not only by poor nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, it is necessary to be physically active.
Specialists recommend adhering to a low-carbohydrate diet.
A diet like this will not only help to lose weight but also protect from sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and thus help to create a feeling of fullness, secretion of digestive juices, and enhance the digestion of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about "weekend migraine" in workaholics.
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in well-being over the weekend.
The reason for feeling worse after workdays is often "weekend migraine," said well-known endocrinologist, medical science candidate, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the Systemic Medicine Clinic Zuhra Pavlova on her Telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics especially often suffer from this, experiencing headaches, fatigue, and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that, in addition to the fatigue accumulated over the week, there are quite a lot of objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to changing conditions.
On weekends, our life changes fundamentally.
"We sleep for a long time, lie on the couch all day, most likely eat more and drink less," the doctor argued. "A slight withdrawal begins because of the lack of coffee.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and lethargy.
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction that is called jet lag.
It occurs in travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which factor plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most over the weekend.

South African scientists have declared the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omicron"
In South Africa, they reported the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omicron"
Scientists from the South African Republic conducted a study and reported on the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of "Omicron" neutralization) corresponds to (the level of) vaccine efficacy at 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which... casts doubt on the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, - the study text published on the MedRxiv portal states.
Specialists clarified that the medication could protect from a severe progression of the disease.
Previously, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine predicted that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
### English:How much hidden sugar is in common foods?
Sugar is not the best source of essential nutrients.
Excessive consumption in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that an unfamiliar word in the product's ingredients might denote hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition, and glycemic index.
On the label, there could be presented several dozen names that essentially signify sugar.
Glucose and fructose are some of the most common and frequently encountered names.
Also, there may be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black treacle), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in bologna sausage, bread, etc.
As stated by Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter what the ingredient is called in the product composition - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, - it still remains sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, as it is necessary to consider not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc., initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholz: gas will lose its importance for Germany in 25 years
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues to transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil, and coal by 2045, becoming a climatically neutral country.
"In other words, in 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to the FRG and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to maintain its commitment to Ukraine continuing to transport Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is currently of significant importance for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the USA made a statement in which the support from Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine is recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that the certification process for the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline continues.
According to the minister, it was stated during the coalition negotiations and discussions of the coalition agreement that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline currently "does not comply with" the regulations of the European Union.

Hackers hacked into the Twitter account of the Prime Minister of India.
Hackers hacked into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The criminals managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India has allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal payment method, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
In Modi's office, they asked to ignore new messages.
Representatives of the Prime Minister announced that Twitter responded quickly - access to the account was restored.
The page of the Prime Minister of India was hacked in 2020, with calls made to donate to the fund using cryptocurrency.
At the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on December 12 ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12th, at noon, the majority of New Caledonia residents voted against the independence of their territory in the referendum.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to the preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) of the voters expressed support for the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia participating in the elections.
As the France-Presse agency comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as the proponents of independence called on voters not to participate in the voting.
Being the initiators of the referendum, they spoke out against holding it on December 12th, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago interferes with conducting a full and "honest" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation opened the way to the third victory of the supporters of the French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
As the separatists stated, they do not recognize the results of the latest vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Élysée Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to give a speech following the results of this referendum.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence has greatly enlivened the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of the territory remaining a part of France, as it is the "last region of European Union presence in the Pacific Ocean."
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour repeatedly insisted.
Republican candidate Valérie Pécresse made the same statement, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
From his side, Emmanuel Macron declared in May 2018 that he would not take a position, "because it is not his responsibility."
Nevertheless, the president added, "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed a "strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France."
Sveta, oh, hi!
I was a bit... excessively rude to you, I've felt awkward and ashamed about it ever since.

Just let's not forget that the food was NATURAL, so obesity wasn't as widespread as it is now.

In Turkey, the world's first drone with a laser weapon was tested
In Turkey, successful tests were conducted of the world's first drone with laser weapons.
The UAV "Eren" was tested at distances ranging from 100 to 500 meters, reports "MIR24".
The device is capable of neutralizing explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight altitude of the new aircraft reaches 3 thousand meters.
After passing the relevant tests, the UAV should be put into service with the Turkish military, who will use it to destroy explosive devices without involving sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and manufacturing their own drones.

Readers of WSJ criticized the article about Russia-US relations.
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized the article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his view of the relations between Russia and the U.S.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and made a number of offensive remarks about the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "present a united front against Russia."
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quotes a comment from one of the readers.
Europe is not ours to "lose," and Ukraine is not our land.
The USA and NATO allies will never engage in a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," noted another.

An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The focus was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation jet drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish factory, they will start creating reactive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
On December 11, the freelance adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, Alexey Arestovich, announced this.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics: the fuselage and such," Dialog.ua quotes him as saying.
Commenting on the key features of ANKA drones, Arestovich said they are jet, not piston, UAVs.
According to him, this new generation of drones surpasses Bayraktar "in all aspects".
The first batch of UAVs is to be produced by the factory at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aerial vehicle was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the authorities of Turkey in collaboration with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve, the Ukrainian General Staff classified the information on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the combined forces' military operations in Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that construction of a plant for manufacturing modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement for the construction of a center in the Kyiv region, which will be used for training personnel, as well as for testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a major real step forward".
In the airport, two lions escaped from a container.
Lions escaped at Singapore's Changi Airport.
According to The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the airplanes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown which country they were brought from to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from him because of the protective netting set up nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival at the airport of representatives from the Mandai Wildlife Group, the organization that oversees all Singaporean zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, no people were harmed.
Specialists have warned about the cancer risk from vitamin B9
Research suggests that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, may lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
According to experts, there is substantial evidence that people who do not suffer from a deficiency of folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, dietician Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if there is a significant deviation from this number either upward or downward.
Kitchen recommends not to take vitamin B9 in pills without a doctor's recommendation, to always monitor the dosage and avoid cereal with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine named folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since it is found, among other things, in avocados, Fayn recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, by April, about 75,000 people could die due to the omicron strain.
Forecasts by British scientists show that due to the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, up to 75,000 people may die in England in the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened in the winter.
The Guardian reported this, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast by experts who are part of the scientific advisory group for emergencies at the British Cabinet, by April 2022 the country will have recorded no fewer than 25,000 fatalities due to the Omicron strain, and in total about 175,000 patients will have been hospitalized.
During the peak of the illness, hospitals will be admitting over 2,000 infected patients daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent the National Health Service from being overwhelmed if the omicron strain proves to be more contagious than the delta variant and the current vaccines are unable to prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
The UK Health Security Agency has reported that if the rate of spread of the Omicron variant remains at the current level, by the end of the year there will be about 1 million cases detected in the country.
By mid-December, the Omicron variant may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
As of now, 1,898 cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus have been detected in the United Kingdom, with 633 identified in the last 24 hours.
On December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality, this figure could already be reaching 10,000 cases.
I wanted to write some kind of smart comment, but then I read up to this point:

Demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter in the world.
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for the next year are breaking all records worldwide, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world ship registry, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the consequences of climate change, as we aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people with the desire and money to own a floating fortress for 50 million dollars or more will not decrease, writes "The Guardian".
However, their numbers are growing.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there hasn't been such a frenzy on the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If previously all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and conduct negotiations via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for the year 2025 and beyond.
This means that clients are willing to pay more just so that their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People simply crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
Sociologists say that the wealthy do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, space travel, living on yachts, or flying in their own planes cause irritation in society because the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and are suggesting the introduction of new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such mobility of money, accomplishing this will be extremely difficult.
Meanwhile, not only the number of super-yachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Out of 1200 ships, 27 have a stern length of over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Røkke is building the 183-meter yacht REV Ocean.
After the launch, this will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a "moon pool," as well as a submarine designed for exploring the ocean depths.
On existing super-yachts, helipads, open-air cinemas, and, on some of them, like the yacht of fighter McGregor, a platform for single combats have become common. Richard Wilk, Professor of Economic Anthropology at Indiana University in America, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance, considering that there are just over 2000 multimillionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the carbon footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than that of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If an average person produces 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet's biggest polluter Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two-thirds of the emission trail was attributed to his 162.5-meter yacht Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and order to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not evoke sympathy from others when they, like the richest woman in Australia, Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there are no docking spots for their giant vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels over 50 meters long.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of colorectal cancer has been determined
American scientists have determined the amount of alcoholic beverages per week that increases the risk of developing cancer.
The Daily Express newspaper is reporting on this.
Specialists have concluded that consuming four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of cancer development.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, the risk of developing colorectal cancer is higher in moderately drinking men than in women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of cancer, only noting that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how advanced quadruped pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to definitively find out how intelligence is developed in animals.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, new research proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The researchers' work was published in the Sciencealert publication.
Dogs can't play chess or compose poetry, they don't understand anything about politics, economics, and art, yet they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show better results in understanding human language words, but there is not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions yet.
Yes, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and are as capable of learning as a two-year-old child.

Ukraine has prepared for the trade between the USA and Russia
The USA and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's accession to NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov stated in his article for the "Glavred" publication.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to resume negotiations in the near future regarding the United States' guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite American leader Joe Biden's statements about the right of countries "to join wherever they want".
If you are offered something blatantly unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you surely wouldn't haggle, but simply send away the person making the offer.
As for Ukraine, a trade is looming," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine but seeks dialogue with Kyiv.
"The preparation is conducted covertly, swiftly, and immediately transitions to offensive operations, instead of waiting until the group is detected and counteraction forces are deployed," he noted.
China is stimulating the development of the railway transportation industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the USA, Germany, France, and other countries at the Chinese International Rail Transit & Equipment Manufacturing Industry Exposition 2021, which took place in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, Central China.
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, noted the company representative Hou Zhao Wen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and performance of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway transport vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed."
In May of this year, the first Chinese-developed double-decker high-speed electric trains intended for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary, and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the subway train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the subway line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The movement on this subway line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese industry for the production of railway equipment is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international competitive innovation," said Feng Yaosyan, head of the trade and investment department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
"This industry constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese manufacturing of high-end equipment on the global market," said Feng Yaosyan.
After more than 60 years of intense work, conducting a series of independent studies and developments, China has created an advanced system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of support tools and large-scale manufacturing activities.
According to Feng Yaosyan, the country ranks first in terms of railway electrification level and in operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin, in a conversation with Sputnik radio, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of mild cognitive impairments, such as an inability to concentrate, plan, and a reduced level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion about whether hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development, the specialist said.
Golosheykin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a deficiency of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, medical professionals do not know of any effective treatments for dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in a timely manner.
According to him, learning foreign languages and engaging in active communication can help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense engagement of memory and logical thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, however, their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being debated in the scientific community," Golosheykin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities using games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking," said Golosheykin.
The dementia research charity in the United Kingdom earlier stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people from the age of 40.
Healthcare professionals have named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first troubling sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient has difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia that specialists have named is aphasia - a condition when a person can't find the right words to convey what they want to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent for treatment abroad
Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze to journalists, who is part of a panel of doctors established by the Ombudsman of Georgia.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the primary concern in his illness.
Stable problems include issues with mobility, coordination, mood variability," the specialist said, noting that this is within the normal range and the former president now needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," Toidze noted, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special facility, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili started to sabotage receiving medical assistance after the penitentiary service staff subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain.
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate took place, reports the news agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the event was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for visiting bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and night entertainment venues.
Many demonstrators came to the event without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the government of totalitarianism and called for respecting the choices of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required for entry into entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
The protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified, and over 88,000 patients have died.
Russia also plans to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit venues for mass events, cultural institutions, public catering establishments, and retail trade outlets by presenting either a certificate of vaccination or a past illness, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for train and airplane travel.

Steep Ascent: How the Chinese are Becoming Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create world-class resorts in the country.
In China, they hope that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow the collection of the 1 trillion yuan indicated by President Xi Jinping, but will also contribute to the economic development of the backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greening efforts are also underway: workers are planting trees.
In the country, there are more than 700 ski resorts, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiajie, there are problems with snow.
The main long-term goal is to provide a comfortable and enjoyable vacation at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, that is still a long way off.
Justin Downs, the Games organization advisor, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every winter, more and more Chinese people head to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation created there.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, not far from the winter Olympic Games venues.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
### English:Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, now none of the local residents are suffering from unemployment.
More and more stores selling clothing and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
On the slopes, food service points are opened with dishes of national cuisine.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment should reach a world-class level.
More than 500 million people worldwide may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO has announced
More than 500 million people worldwide could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has halted humanity's progress in the issue of universal access to healthcare services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have stated.
In connection with the International Universal Health Coverage Day observed on December 12, WHO and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
In them, they noted that the pandemic led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and caused excessive strain on healthcare systems.
For the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
WHO and the World Bank emphasized that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for healthcare."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and that over four billion people have virtually no social support.

Reuters: The Taiwanese minister was cut off from the broadcast at the "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
The performance of Taiwan's Digital Minister Audrey Tang at the panel discussion during the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was translated in audio-only mode, evident from the summit's YouTube recording.
Reuters agency, citing sources, claims that the image was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to their statement, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a different color from the PRC, which considers the island to be its territory.
The map that Mrs. Tan was showing had been compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world according to the degree of ensuring civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as "free", while the PRC, DPRK, Laos, and Vietnam were marked in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the image on her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the discussion participants "do not necessarily express the position of the U.S. government."
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Sources from Reuters note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister could contradict the "One China" policy upheld by Washington.
One of the agency's sources stated that after the map was demonstrated, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of displaying Taiwan as a separate country.
The "Summit for Democracy" organized by Washington took place from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "Zero Day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and chief editor of "Novaya Gazeta," Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained via corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, Yuri Averyanov, stated that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".
They feed you information as if they are preparing food, and there's rotten meat everywhere, when in fact the meat stays with the butcher to the very last piece.
Classic journalism is to create news out of nothing.
They boil not meat, but horns and hooves, obtaining a glue-like substance.
The finished product looks like a yellowish translucent strip almost odorless and solid, like plastic, used as a natural gelatin.
Generally, the harmful substances from waste processing are no less than those from its decomposition.

The New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board has made a suborbital flight.
### English:On Saturday, December 11, the New Shepard spacecraft from Blue Origin with six tourists on board completed a suborbital flight.
The journey, which was broadcast on the company's website, lasted a total of more than ten minutes, after which the capsule with passengers descended to Earth, reports TASS.
The launch of the carrier rocket was conducted from a spaceport in the area of the American city of Van Horn (Texas).
The ship rose to an altitude of just over 100 km, and the space tourists experienced weightlessness.
The rocket itself landed normally at the spaceport pad.
Blue Origin successfully carried out the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers on board on July 20.
SKETCHES OF A COUNTRY DWELLER FROM MOSCOW.
Don't lump everything together - there are bad people, and you might have specific grievances against them...
But what does the number of children, age, pension fund, and so on have to do with it?
Write that they are "scoundrels, didn't return the money."
As for how many children they have and when, it's none of your business, as long as they don't plan to put those children on your neck.
And since that is out of the question, by what right do you have to judge them?
Probably, it's just like that in education...
Chosen (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, blatantly disregarding the existing ones.
And if it will also affect other spheres of life, judicial proceedings, etc.?
For them, the laws are not written.
And if Dad still implements his parenting and education methodology?
It's some kind of horror and a very bad example for others.

China is strengthening prevention and epidemic control of COVID-19 in cities where land border crossings are located.
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the PRC has issued a circular mandating the strengthening of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control measures in cities where land border crossings are located, with the aim of further preventing the importation of the infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those arriving in cities where land border crossings are located must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day the respective provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, up until March 15, 2022.
Moreover, it is noted that cities where inland checkpoints are located and that meet certain conditions may consider options for establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke about the "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the USA.
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Ryabkov, in an interview with "Izvestia," assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
Unilateral negative predictability exists, but when it comes to any prospects for improving relations, everything is absolutely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion after a long journey that we have passed with the current administration, and with Trump, and with Obama.
"The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is related to the United States' attempts to impose its approaches on Russia on a number of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he wouldn't dare to make optimistic forecasts about the prospects of improving relations and wouldn't expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress is being observed.
In this regard, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to issues of international security and hopes that the signals will be heard, and that Americans will heed the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated in a meeting with the American Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the U.S.
Virologist warns about the dangers of vaccinating with a nasal drug for COVID outside of hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may experience allergies and require medical assistance, therefore the first vaccination sites for this vaccine should not be set up in airports and shopping centers.
TASS was informed by virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology at Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
Set up nasal vaccine vaccination points in airports and shopping centers is easier, but I would only do this in medical institutions at first.
The fact is that there is a possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine; it is small, but it is advisable for the person to sit near the doctor's office afterwards.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that act literally within a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov stated.
According to the virologist, considering vaccination in shopping centers will be possible when there is accumulated experience in the use of the drug.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important for it to reach the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
There is a possibility that the vaccine may not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated blows their nose after the injection due to nasal congestion.

Serbia has produced 2 million doses of the "Sputnik V" vaccine
The "Sputnik V" vaccine is most popular in Serbia.
Serbia has produced about 2 million doses of the Russian "Sputnik V" vaccine, the country's Minister of Innovation and Technological Development, Nenad Popović, told TASS.
"At the Torlak state institute, about 2 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine have been produced so far, and we expect that at least 4 million more will be produced in the upcoming period," Popovic stated.

Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced that the Russian Federation has supplied almost two million doses of the domestic "Sputnik V" coronavirus vaccine to Serbia.
Lama, they say, the true believers make up the church.
Whether there are true believers or not, we cannot know.
Each of us would like to be such a truly devout person, and each tries to be one.
But no one should claim either about themselves or about those who believe as they do that they alone are the true believers.
Because if they can say about themselves that they are truly believers, then others can say exactly the same.

Alexander M., could you please remind me of the style in which the marathon was run at the 2021 World Championships?
Do you see the track on which participants of the race have to finish in classic style?
Attention, question - what is Klæbo doing to the right of Bolshunov and how does he intend to get on the ski track if he was behind him on the turn before the gate?
And "the best finisher" at 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.
It was a long time ago...
I was, and in essence, I wasn't even a driver yet.
He had a driver's license, but he couldn't actually drive.
They offered to take a trip on a MAZ for 250 km one way!
Young, foolish, agreed.
The boss is nearby, sipping on vodka, I'm on my way.
First, like a king, he took the central position!
A column lined up behind me.
I missed.
Then the power steering belt broke.
Then the traffic police stopped us.
The column was organized, and their car broke down.
Need to tow.
The MAZ owner explained that he was drunk, the driver inexperienced.
And to him - how drunk are you?
You don't stumble, you don't fall.
Ahead of us with flashing lights and go forward!
In my opinion, he's all over the ads, he's hardly the one to grieve.

In the UK, 1239 cases of the Omicron strain of coronavirus were recorded in a day - RT in Russian
In the past 24 hours, 1239 cases of infection with the new Omicron strain of coronavirus have been identified in the United Kingdom.
Sky News reports this.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "Omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people contracted the new variant of the infection in Scotland, and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the United Kingdom has reached 3,137 people.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine calculated in a pessimistic forecast that in England, 75,000 people might die by April due to the outbreak of coronavirus caused by the "Omicron" variant.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions.
The Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continuing "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia without experiencing suffering oneself," said the official Kremlin spokesman on the "Russia 1" TV channel.
Peskov asserts that "everyone in the world understands this."
It was previously reported that the US is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is confident that this is impossible.

Please note that a child under 3-5 years old still has open channels of communication with the subtle world, and the child may know more than you do!
Residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on New Caledonia's independence, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave France.
On December 12, this was reported by the French TV channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of voters spoke out against independence.
3.51% of the residents of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The voter turnout on that day was very low: about 55% of the archipelago's residents came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to separatists' calls to abstain from participating in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to move the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia in a referendum voted against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on the issue of independence had already been conducted in the region.
Most of the residents supported the archipelago's status as part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers away from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Approximately 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which is endowed with a special administrative-territorial status.
Between Paris and the New Caledonia administration, there is an agreement from 1998, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a two-year interval.

WHO preliminarily considers "Omicron" to be less dangerous than "Delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers the "Omicron" to be less dangerous than the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is data indicating a decrease in vaccine efficacy against the new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, "Omicron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and the significantly altered antigenic profile of the "omicron" strain's protein suggest a reduction in vaccine effectiveness against infection and transmission of the variant.
Based on preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than with "Delta," according to the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of "Omicron" infection in the EU have been mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, according to preliminary data, the new strain spreads faster than "Delta."
In Russia, two cases of infection with the Omicron strain have been registered.
They "were previously immunized," reported the Gamaleya Center.
Head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova has stated that there is no reliable data yet to suggest that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios were named for Zelensky.
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four potential scenarios for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may be left without support from the West and may also make compromises on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko talked about this in a publication on the "Glavred" portal.
The first scenario, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm," suggests that key Western countries will cease to support Ukraine, having reached an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a turn of events will contribute to a profound crisis that Kyiv may face in 2023.
At the same time, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> domestic protests and the authorities' confrontation with key FIGs (financial-industrial groups. - Ed.)," added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the situation to develop - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, which will see the Ukrainian authorities facing a number of problems.
Due to such circumstances, the Ukrainian leadership might agree to compromises regarding Donbass, which could lead to internal conflicts within the country.
At the end of summer, Zelensky's positions will weaken, according to the former deputy, the likelihood of such a situation is up to 50-55%.
The third scenario for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between population groups that disagree with Zelensky and the president, which could lead to the seizure of control over the security block and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
During this variant of the crisis, Zelensky will begin the "reformatting of power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is turning Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
An event that could lead to this would be a profound shock to society.
"The event must be significant enough to elicit a response from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denysenko said.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made catastrophe, or aggressive actions by Russia, believes the former deputy.
The Russian side has already repeatedly denied any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is specifically the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the USA that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11th, survey data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the approval rating of the Ukrainian president fell to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since he was elected head of state.
Analysts have predicted a situation in which if the next Ukrainian presidential elections were held, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, whereas for the former president of the country, Petro Poroshenko, 14.5%.
Among all those surveyed, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great sportswoman; I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had passed away; it's very upsetting to learn such news.
I remember how I rooted for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, the residents of Primorye, it was a live broadcast, real-time.
Such a fervor of passions, emotions were off the scale, I remember the joy when Elena won.
Also rejoiced in other victories, cheered for Salnikov, for the football players, for all the then Soviet athletes.
On TV, I once saw a documentary about one of the Central American countries, and there they were rolling watermelons up a ramp onto a ship, like barrels.
Watermelons were of monstrous sizes.
In my youth, I worked many times on harvesting and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and never came across watermelons weighing more than a pood.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the field and not before the beginning of August.

Balconette bra with soft lace cups, on frames.
The lower part of the cup is reinforced with non-elastic transparent fabric.
The side inner part of the cup, in the area where the strap is attached, is reinforced with non-stretch fabric folded over, without additional seams for comfort.
This particular element prevents the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the scalloping along the neckline and under the bust.
Vertical bones on the side panels of single-layer microfiber prevent the fabric from twisting on larger sizes.

Poet arrested for an action on Red Square: "They give you 10 days for quoting Yevtushenko, that's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, the 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was detained for ten days.
A HSE student was detained in Red Square with a sign that had the hashtag #apoetinRussiaismorethanapoet written on it.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander for an administrative offense related to the repeated violation of the regulations governing the conduct of a public event.
He was first detained on January 23 at Pushkinskaya Square, at a rally in support of Alexey Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry as a whole, now, unfortunately, interest in it is lost, to the decline of the general culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their verses on the internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to more fully reveal the message of his missive.
How did the police officers treat you during the arrest this time and in the past?
What were they asking in the department, how did they comment on your promotion?
This time the employees were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, however funny that might sound in some context of this word.
On Pushkinskaya, the OMON troops took action, and it was harsh.
They asked routinely, about the motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked either with approval or at least with understanding.
Except for the monkey house being ventilated on all 4 sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if after this campaign people start posting their poems under this hashtag, even if it's just a few individuals, then these 10 days I’ve spent will not have been in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak alone even in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
At public and official events, they speak the language of those present so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
It's a matter of protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian fluently and yet she resorts to the help of an interpreter.
And also at official events, minutes are taken the old-fashioned way with a fountain pen, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.
If you don't want to say much, just say no!
So much water has flowed.
Well, to go as a tourist for half a year "to the Andes, then to Nepal".
Before that, convert all assets into liquid stocks.
And gradually sell off these shares by opening an account at any bank in the world.
Sell not in dollars, but in a currency less dependent on the US, such as Swiss francs.
And then proceed with filing for a divorce from America.
However, this is not what keeps Americans in the USA.
Their confidence that it is better in the USA than anywhere else keeps them going.
They are raised like that.

Researchers explained how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and reduce cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the body's systems to function.
Furthermore, potatoes help combat age-related disorders.
Due to the high fiber content, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular consumption, it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to stew or boil the root vegetable rather than frying it in oil.
The Daily Express previously warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, just like other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are products containing carbohydrates that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sweetened soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the reduction in their production in private subsidiary farms and the increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, at the moment, only imports will be able to replace the deficit in products.
Lostfilm, lordfilm, and other pirates will be removed from Yandex's search results.
Candidates for elimination
In 2015, rights holders from the "RAEC/Media" cluster compiled a list of the top 100 largest pirate sites on the RuNet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, CEO of the Internet Research Institute.
However, some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks in part to regularly changing their domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both "Yandex" and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - an original series of the largest video service in Russia, ivi (included in AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the video quality, it is a so-called cam version (a pirated copy of the film recorded in a theater).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Универ. 10 Years Later" from the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-media") is available.
Svetlana M., I'm sorry, of course, but I couldn't care less whether your little son gets upset on behalf of his mommy or not.

Of course, it's good that this happens rarely.

Lyudmila, China now has the leading space technology.
Russia has already hopelessly fallen behind.
"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more accurate to say that Poland merely adapted the idea from 1776 for itself, but developed it quite effectively.
Actually, the slogan "The Outskirts - not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, generally speaking, doesn't really change the essence.
I watched her interview, the girl said that her biggest dream is to grow wings, her dad is always holding her back.

Well, as they say, there's no accounting for taste.
I really liked "Tarkhun," not the current one, of course.

Two were just right.

This means that there are 2000 coils per sleeping spot, which operate fully autonomously.
Their functioning provides a unique pinpoint adjustment.
"Микропакет" is the highest frequency of all the varieties of "Dimax" spring blocks, therefore it has a clearly pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: above and below the springs, combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface has latex, then the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long carried the status of classic, as it provides the mattress not only with orthopedic but also with anatomical properties.
If the coir provides proper back support, then latex offers surface adaptation to the human body.
The cover: the model comes in a quilted jersey Aloe Vera cover.
At the client's request, it can be made either removable or fixed.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping area is 170 kg.

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, "Aktualnaya Kamera" reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions launching in five years is to assess the habitability of Venus's clouds and then to search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed instruments for measuring the acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic to support life, but it is likely that initially Venus was an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is expected to arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be - does it resemble terrestrial life or is it different?
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not begin on Earth.
If it differs, then it becomes more likely that life originated on Earth," explained the head of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Mihkel Pajusalu.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of metaverses became popular in the fall of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Therefore, businesses in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions due to the pandemic, since people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
From another perspective, it is a consequence of the business's aspiration to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitizing assets, when any rights, securities, artworks, and even money transition into a digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing one's diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer crave something too fatty and harmful.
Certainly, we will have traditional Olivier and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one is forcing me to gorge on everything all at once.
One can have a spoonful, try it - and it will be enough.
Indeed, there are ten days off ahead, and you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.
And how much hellish work, time, and resources she needed for training.
And having completed 5 quad jumps, she remained without gold.
And she also understands that she won't last the 4 years until the next Olympics; that is, she will never be an Olympic champion.
And the one who was just not engaged in sports or cannot imagine all the circles of hell she went through, DO NOT JUDGE.
British economist couldn't give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to provide a forecast for 2022 because, in his opinion, such attempts would end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend could change the course.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in second place is inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in prices for goods is temporary or not.
The specialist noted that even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless generosity of central banks had outlived its usefulness" and it was time to return to relations where interest rates, taking inflation into account, would correlate with the expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-loose economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the increase in the poverty rate and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, the head of global research at "Discovery Investments," Mikhail Shulgin, reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 are being maintained, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar exchange rate, Shulgin named the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices, and concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic.
I am forced to agree.
However, one thing is gratifying: if you compare yourself with yourself, there were fewer containers five years ago.
Now it's better.
Progress exists, just sluggish.
There is also this problem: there are many ecological initiatives in the cities, but people don't know about them.
Various eco-taxis that collect waste from homes.
Just a standard recycling collection point - it's used by marginalized people.
Rarely does anyone bring glass and metal there.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
As a result of the first 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2.784 trillion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than for the same period last year, according to statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (RAMR).
For context regarding the scale - approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the government on supporting citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
In the past September, at the meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization countries, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the year 2020.
In terms of revenue, the Korean brand Kia leads the market in Russia.
In the 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the previous year.
### English:The related brand Hyundai has seen an even more substantial increase - over 35%, with revenue from car sales estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is leading in terms of the growth in the average weighted price of a car - over the year, Hyundai's average price increased by almost 21%, reaching 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely, and Mercedes-Benz saw higher price increase dynamics.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands did not increase as significantly: according to the statistics of the car manufacturers committee of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more vehicles in the same period than the year before.
Hyundai - almost by 12%.
Rounding out the top three in sales volume in monetary terms is the Japanese Toyota - over 10 months, Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand, which is 14% more than the year before.
Mercedes-Benz follows the Japanese with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand saw an increase in both sales volume (by 37%) and the average weighted price of a car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz is experiencing both a good sales growth and an average price increase - greater, for example, than that of BMW - hence the greater growth in financial capacity," explained Tatyana Arabadji, CEO of NAPI.
Chinese brands are showing fantastic sales growth rates, also significantly increasing their financial capacity this year.
Russian Lada shows average market performance in terms of income growth (plus 28%), with Russians spending 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
Companies such as Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Nissan, whose car sales in units fell in 2021, are at the same financial capacity level as last year.
UAZ is in the red - over 10 months Russians spent 12 billion rubles on this brand's SUVs and pickups compared to 12.4 billion rubles the year before.
Amid problems with the supply of auto components and disruptions in production affecting the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to adjust prices continuously - the same "AvtoVAZ" raised the price of Lada models seven times within a year, with the latest increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurring at the end of November.
Other car manufacturers also regularly rewrite the price tags on their products.
The volume of Russia's car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation also contributes to this, as well as the desire of automotive corporations to recover past losses, experts believe.
In the conditions of a car shortage, I think that many car manufacturers were even partially able to pass on the costs from past periods to the consumer, which they couldn't previously include in the price of cars.
Analyst from "VTB Capital" specializing in the automotive industry, Vladimir Bespalov, says. -
I believe that in financial terms, car manufacturers are feeling very good now, maintaining a high sales margin.
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in car prices, which has been observed throughout 2021, with the prices for new vehicles increasing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the increasing complexity of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
As supply increases, opportunities for raising prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian automotive market will continue to grow next year as well, and even if the growth in automobile prices slows down, car manufacturers will be able to earn their income due to volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now aiming to make the maximum profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev.
There is no expectation of an increase in the production volumes of machinery for at least the next six months, while in Russia, the frenzy is further fueled by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
Given the current market situation, cars have turned out to be a decent investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original cost, the expert notes.
Biden spoke about the redeployment of US troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion.
The US leadership never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a "Russian invasion".
With such a statement came forward the President of the USA, Joe Biden.
"There have never been such plans," said the White House chief, responding to a journalist's question about whether the US had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he emphasized that the US and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the US will deploy forces to the Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the Eastern Flank, B9 – all those NATO countries with respect to which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden declared.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intentions of invading the territory of Ukraine.
Moscow sees a problem in Kyiv's combat use of drones supplied by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are getting closer to our territory."
I immediately leave such interviews.
If during the interview they want to make me listen to yelling, wait for hours, drink some questionable swill, and even wash a cup - it's scary to imagine what it would be like at work.
I'll find a decent place for myself, without the HR middle layer, where you can talk directly to the manager.

If you receive a call from a scammer pretending to be an "MVD officer" or from another law enforcement agency, it's not effective to just hang up on them, and you will likely not have time to add them to the blacklist.
Because to confirm his lie about involvement with the power structures, he quickly repeats the call and continues to intimidate and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
Here's such nonsense...

Maria Kartashova, what does "in response to this" mean?
I don't voice my thoughts; I mentally curse all of you.

And from the outside, I can even smile at you.
But I remember that thought is material!

The Russian film "Unclenching the Fists" nominated for an "Oscar" award received the European Film Academy award (also known as the "European Oscar") for "Best Editing," reports the "Moskovsky Komsomolets."
The jury of the contest, which voted online due to the complex epidemiological situation, evaluated the outstanding craftsmanship of the film's creators.
### English:This time, the film "Quo vadis, Aida?" by Jasmila Žbanić (Bosnia) received the maximum number of awards.
The main character of the film is a UN mission interpreter who tries to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Unclenching the Fists," directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), this film tells the story of the complicated relationship between a domineering father and his adult children who want to free themselves from paternal care in North Ossetia.
Earlier it was announced that this film has been nominated for the "Oscar" award for best foreign language film.
As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey show, in my opinion, you are, to put it mildly, not up to date.
Just yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of the joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
