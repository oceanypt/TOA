The big comeback of the Czech unlucky person is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a tough period in his career in recent months, is making a return to the NHL.
Thirty-one-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon get his chance in goal.
Former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň, or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured during the NHL pre-season in October this year.
Exactly at the halfway point of the game with Vegas, he switched and since then he has not yet appeared on the NHL rinks.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to the other.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver team announced in early October.
His return to the NHL goal was ultimately extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning American time, he was called up from the farm where he had played four games and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he actually recorded a 94.5% save percentage.
A product of Pilsen hockey wants to finally make his mark and prove that he belongs in the world's best league.
In the final year, he struggled with hip problems and didn't play a single match in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "Francík" played in 36 games, his save percentage is at 92.3%.
Charles is putting a mask on Camille in the Christmas card, William and Kate are posing in Jordan.
British Prince William and his wife Kate have selected a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan for this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also made his wishes known, using a photograph in which he is helping his wife Camilla put on a mask at the races.
On its website, the British news station BBC reported on this.
Wishes are sent to friends, colleagues, and foundations with whom they collaborate.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color, and Princess Charlotte is wearing a dress as well.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared t-shirt just like Princes George and Louis.
The photographer was not disclosed by William and Kate, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas wish on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk County.
The photograph that will be used as a Christmas greeting was also released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured it at the races in Ascot in June.
Charles, who wears a top hat on his head and a mask on his face, is helping Camille put on her mask color coordinated with her light dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbr a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – In the current corruption case, detectives reportedly worked with the accusation that the former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, had been promised a million crowns by Prague's Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The server efotbal.cz informed about this, stating that it had access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red and whites did not engage in any corrupt behavior.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which the former sports director of Slavia, Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer, figures prominently.
The former influential official of the red-and-whites, according to the file, was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminal investigators reportedly worked with information that Slavia promised Berbro financial reward for winning the title.
2019 won the team SK Slavia Prague the title in the first league.
The police authority had information that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe by officials of SK Slavia Prague for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
One day later, according to detectives, Berbr met not only with Nezmar but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia, Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file no longer shows whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt actions.
Between the years 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative for its development.
We have never engaged in illegal activity, never sought to influence referees in violation of fair play rules, and have not provided anyone with any financial compensation in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar offensively insults some former Slavia players with dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was sparked last year in mid-October by a police raid in several locations including the headquarters of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) in Prague.
The highest-ranking official involved in the affair is Berbr, who no longer holds any position in football.
In mid-January, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz, he was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks, and IFVs are Cold War larping.
The guns will be new but of a fundamentally inferior type (the gunners must leave the armored cabin and carry cartridges by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyota Hi-Lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus it has been successful in phasing out the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we manufacture and export abroad)
AA: middle - Cold War era, outdated; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I have the chase right next to the town.
From the river, coypus were emerging and damaging the crops, so I went there to sit.
When I was coming, I saw that on the other bank of the river there is a fisherman.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I just sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped he would leave before something crawled out, but of course, in a moment the fox went.
I let her come within 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
Before I got out of the high seat, he was gone.
Which means the meadow can be trouble.
On the other hand, it's not war; it would have to be a combination of many coincidences for something to happen, and most likely, you would be seen in thermal imaging, which almost everyone has today.
So, put it in a visible place, keep valuable things at your feet in the sleeping bag, and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The interior ministry procured respirators significantly cheaper than the ministry of health.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of face masks, masks, and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day, the amounts for respirators differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities acted economically?
And why were others shopping at higher prices?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of the iRozhlas server Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and armies (maybe I am not affected by memories of the CSLA experienced by older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from mandatory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of equipment that trained personnel could take over; we actually don't have modern equipment even for the existing professionals. Moreover, modern equipment is becoming increasingly complex, so the abilities of reservists will rapidly deteriorate over time.
In modern conventional conflicts, which can be rapidly deployed, they will be unfolding very quickly; there won't be time to retrain someone.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense are very significant for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to conduct massive guerrilla warfare, and it is also an absolute necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, a conflict would only take place if it were of such a scale and intensity that guerrilla warfare would become irrelevant, and we do not even have suitable geography for it.
we don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is that half of them act as if they had it.
Then you get into situations where you're watching a dude, who 2 minutes ago missed an empty net, driving into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 defenders, and you're saying to yourself, "damn, what do you think is going to happen now?".
Of course, they'll treat him like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "dribbling past defenders" is so terrible that I catch myself being genuinely surprised when I see that our attacker has managed to get past one of the opposing players.
First swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down; however, experts do not expect any significant turnaround in the coming weeks.
The pressure on hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is known: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently predominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination helps against it or post-infection immunity acquired from having previously contracted the disease.
But this week, the covid equation has also seen the entry of an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease progression and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be complemented by the drug Paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports an efficacy of even 85 percent from the current results.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, in addition to offering hope for expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how ready the local administration is for the incoming medications.
As was mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company finished first in the race also because the drug started being developed well before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for viral diseases of horses on the South American continent.
In these studies, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not share their opinions openly.
Therefore, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to speaking our minds.
You will conduct research where you ask people whether they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most will tell you no without beating about the bush.
In the West, they'll tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
He is afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in surveys, west good, east bad.
But they will really find out what people think.
In France, both Le Pen and Zemmour have over 20% according to the polls.
Even we know that the objects are in Czech three and completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of units so that soldiers do not have to relearn where everything is, all facilities are exactly the same.
From one is the Atom Museum Brdy and the remaining two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its territory, whether for security reasons or because of the speed of deploying warheads due to the more westerly location.
In those underground bunkers (there are two in each maple), only the warheads were stored, not the entire missiles as is said.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit would arrive that would pick up this warhead and mount it onto some sort of delivery device.
Besides that museum maple, the remaining ones are in a derelict condition.
In the second stage of primary school, we had a Romani classmate for 4 years.
He was quite alright, made good jokes, often expressed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
He got along with everyone, often came over to explain things further, was rarely absent, attended regularly, engaged in sports with us, never stole snacks or phones, came dressed neatly.
He also went on school trips to nature, did various monkey business, but he was cool, maybe never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, Gypsies, joined the same grade, but different classes.
Shortly afterwards, they beat up the teacher, the police often dealt with something there, they threatened and endangered other students.
I personally sometimes sell things through classified ads (old stuff, things I don't need, etc.) and I've often sold to Roma people; they always had the money, didn't try to haggle me excessively, and communication was calm.
I even sold a car like this once, a guy called after a month to say he had transferred it to his name.
I say about myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue, or otherwise, as long as they behave as is appropriate in polite society (works, functions, doesn't beat women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes along, reaches out, empties apartments and houses, has only disorder around themselves, causes problems.. it doesn't matter what color they are, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they integrate with us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, it's all the same to me, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs too.
Young woman died in car accident in Prachatice district
"The young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene," South Bohemian emergency medical services spokesperson Zuzana Fajtlová told Právo.
The accident was most likely caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
An eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was most likely traveling from the village of Žíchovec towards the village of Bavorov when he veered into the oncoming lane for reasons yet to be determined.
After the collision with the Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road, described the accident South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
He sustained multiple injuries and remained trapped in the vehicle.
After being rescued, he had to receive emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the České Budějovice hospital in a stable condition, stated paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, customers often do not provide information.
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it still pays off to import, especially from Japan, where postage is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, the cost of ordering small parcels has slightly increased for him, as he now has to add VAT and provide postal information for customs processing.
He receives an email stating that the customs officers are expecting the arrival of a package.
Then simply fill out the shipment details, and if the merchant did not include VAT at the time of sale, the customs office will assess it from the total amount for the shipment and for transportation.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure on their own, the carrier's fee must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisel, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll tick one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs regulations, the daily number of international parcels received at the Prague post office has decreased from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, another problem is that people do not respond to requests for information that are necessary to complete customs procedures.
Currently, there are 30 thousand shipments at the international post office that we need to process.
"If people filled in all the necessary information and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway through," says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Inflation solution
See the headline, how would you suggest solving the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation and further increases are expected.
What do you think the government should do to slow down this growth or compensate for it?
We see, for example, in Poland a reduction of VAT on food and fuel, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where this is headed?
Prices are rising faster than wages, in my opinion it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford common things, especially energy.
How much did you get as a raise (if you are an employee)?
This year they gave me a 2% gross increase, which is a mockery, but fortunately, I have a similar income from the business I run alongside my employment.
Could someone be able to explain why demonstrably convicted violent offenders are sent behind bars for just 6 months?
My mind simply can't comprehend how the court can only send such a beast to jail for 6 months just for them to do it again as soon as they get out.
Six months is nothing in comparison to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, which will negatively affect her/his sexual relationships and relationships overall.
And not to mention that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also deter potential future rape reporting by victims?
The man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
The man from Hrob inadvertently helped the guards to secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlaty, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He summoned her himself.
He went about it in a roundabout way.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After being called to the emergency line, the guards arrived on the scene and were amazed when the alleged "robbed" person told them that he had made it all up so that the guards would come to the place.
In fact, he only wanted to ask the officers for advice on how to report an incident to the Czech Republic Police.
During the identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman is on the list of wanted persons, subject to nationwide search, and there is an arrest warrant issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Czech Police.
Sincere question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that Slavs are no longer an ethnic or cultural entity, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Of course, I agree with the meme, it's a pity that Churchill didn't manage to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I'm not sure, it's quite the question whether a rational person can truly believe in something completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are, if I'm not mistaken, an estimated ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you severely if you believe in another god.
But it also says in the Ten Commandments that there is no other god but Yahweh.
Wouldn't it therefore be more rational in such a case to refrain from believing in any god, rather than risk choosing the wrong one out of those thousands of gods and have the one true god, whom I just happened to miss, send me to hell or some similar place for it?
Other: Voluntary training followed by placement in the reserves.
I believe the Swiss model is similar.
Months of training (in various specializations, X months for each) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person behaves well then they could receive a professional offer.
Such a thing would be useful for all components of the ACR.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can say it like this: The cooperation between the educational sector and industry is constantly reiterated, companies are scouting in schools, and there is a sort of merging, as the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is constantly ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar integration should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I perceive it also as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, the institution that guarantees that no Russian, German, or even Mongolian raider will ever invade here again.
I find it amusing how you consider NATO to be something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if something goes wrong.
What a delight to the gentleman above.
Just one election in the USA that slashes their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas and the Poles have already shown that all they need is to see our backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that works long-term as a guarantor of independence is an army armed to the teeth and a population that can control the military technology of its era.
And nowadays every teenager can pilot remotely controlled vehicles, so why wouldn’t it be possible.
We don't need border fortifications; they are useless today, but a square-jawed teenager behind the joystick of a remote-controlled device will manage.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unwrap gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you find yourself at home overwhelmed with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
A map of stores that will welcome your used boxes has been created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as single-use waste.
Anyone, by agreement, can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map includes almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid overflowing blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply in the market, as well as the money saved, since the price of packaging cardboard has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I am additionally strengthening my brand.
One of these stores is also TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-friendly cleaning products and eco-friendly cosmetics.
Individuals who accumulate them at home bring us boxes and filler material to Popůvky near Brno, but we are also contacted by companies with whom we have agreed regular collections of discarded cartons.
We will use everything for packing parcels from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are together creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauties of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application shows not only collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search tool if you need to dispose of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to dispose of expired medications, tires, spent electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, plus reusable items can find their second home.
The project map now contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, more collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs, and other places are being added, which help to find uses for things that would otherwise unnecessarily become waste," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the app from the organization Ukliďme Česko.
It seems to me that it’s unfortunate that in this day and age, technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone to play games on it don't learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently, a problem has arisen (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because for instance Google Photos or Apple photo applications or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and just throw everything onto one screen in the app.
Feel free to let them use technology from childhood, but most importantly, let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Before the weekend, Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU – which begins in January – and it was grand.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many initiatives that they can't be accomplished in six months.
French politicians like it that way and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters, straddling the right and the left, agree on little, but on Europe, they do.
And in France there will be new presidential elections in April.
The electoral calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write "a single history of Europe" and that France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
Many commentators rushed in with criticism that Macron is engaging in pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In reality, it's more of an attempt to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the argument that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, wasn't so bad, and he is quite successful with it among the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a single history textbook seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them, and never as the story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
However, if they do not have an enlightened teacher, they will not learn what the broader context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also received awards for directing and for Best Actress Jasna Djuricic.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, it remained at the top of the audience rankings.
In Berlin, the best actor award went to Anthony Hopkins for the film The Father.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was about like "having the flu/being snotty". For a few days I had diarrhea and didn't feel much like smoking...
Compared to the regular flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Just personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone feels this way)
Christmas Book Tips
The Christmas double issue, which will be published on December 20, will include a traditional literary supplement.
And along with it, cultural tips will come out too.
We are including these books for you, subscribers, as an addition to this digital edition, so you have enough time to get the books as Christmas presents.
Prose texts that follow on from the previous similar collection by Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another serving of observations of the world and descriptions of ordinary things with an extraordinary poetic attentiveness, depth, and atmosphere.
In his second prose, the photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of a small town as well as Czech society.
A tale about returning to one's roots, which turns out to be just a longed-for illusion.
A Czech studies specialist and comparative literature scholar is adapting the fairy tale about Little Red Riding Hood to the setting of a contemporary village.
Her rendition surpasses the brutality of folk versions and culminates in a horror about emotional emptiness.
And the fact that the way back to the instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a far less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we have become accustomed to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to have a life together.
Trains start running according to a new timetable; some places will see a change of operators.
Trains on the railway will start operating according to a new timetable from Sunday.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some routes, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where instead of Czech Railways, RegioJet begins to operate.
For most routes, only the departure time will be adjusted, or possibly their route will be slightly modified as well.
On the tracks, there will also be dozens of new trains.
Carriers started selling tickets already during the fall.
Czech Railways plan to schedule an average of 6783 passenger transport connections per day in the new timetable, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains per day.
During the new timetable, trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers.
In addition to domestic routes, the new timetable will also include services to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new timetable, will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains that will run on the routes from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will dispatch additional new trains in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the prices of fares next year, on average by 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry into service on line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace České dráhy here after succeeding in the Ministry of Transport's competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 services on the route every day, eight in each direction.
Further changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at the stations in Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned interruption works, the carrier attempted to maintain the most similar possible timetables for its long-distance trains.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue as well.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where on the track from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk, instead of Czech Railways, trains of the German company Die Länderbahn under the Trilex brand will operate.
Passengers will also be able to use unified fares on the railway the following year.
Just like with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I must disagree.
Don't we perhaps learn to see the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear about how hard they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, they died.
In life, I have never heard teachings from the perspective of the slave-owning side or from that time; no one defends this, only condemns it.
No one even tells you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by other blacks and that they were often the worst slave owners.
Nobody at school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from the Indians; everyone just tells you how we Europeans brutally exterminated them, even though they had been killing each other long before.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly at schools, in both northern schools and in the south.
I have not come across anyone deliberately concealing facts, but I have heard before that it happens and I think it's a problem, I do not deny it (for example, in Japan, the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history isn't black and white and that we have a tendency to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not concerned with someone's feelings, it is simply what it is and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn without considering the context of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, while we're on the subject of the southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, but on the other hand, they also had some good achievements, and it seemed absurd to me to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North wasn't much better, as many people idealize it nowadays.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South were slaveholders and a lot of things were also repugnant to them.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, they intentionally omit some facts, lie, and manipulate, moreover, for example, our point of view doesn't exist there (on YT there was also a video from television where they cut off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that at some universities it was dreadful, the students were quite radicalized, and the schools often supported them in that.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, it makes me feel a bit sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and even within the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has long since achieved what it was supposed to and it's no longer about the same thing; it has become radicalized.
Currently, those who call themselves feminists are often people who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts, as do other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side as well, where it often leads to resistance even against quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I also haven't encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I rather encountered bad geography, but that was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't achieve on my own?
Additionally, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If anything connects me with people, it's interests, views of the world, and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a really great guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always messes up with some bullshit about the coronavirus that makes everyone embarrassed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernism and are essentially Catholics without a pope.
I know many people who are Catholics, but they attend services at the Hussites, because it is theologically very similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael at the Dominican Square falls under the Dominicans and they even hold a mass in Latin there every Sunday at 3:00 PM, as was done before Vatican II.
The Flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts have received it from Austria.
Břeclav - A flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him this time either due to the coronavirus pandemic, and in the morning they took him over from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing.
He was also transferred at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year with our group, and I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, said the scout Amálie Budíková to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, this time it took place at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Scouts usually travel by train to Vienna for him.
There are no changes in the distribution of the flame throughout the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally set out by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
Subsequent distribution of the light on Saturday, December 18, will be taken care of by scout couriers, who will travel by selected express trains and local trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers at the stations will take over the light, who will then continue to spread the small flame throughout the Czech Republic and even to places where tracks do not lead.
This year too, scouts must comply with the valid measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It is happening similarly to last year.
We provide recommendations to both courier teams and organizers of local events to, of course, wear masks, try to maintain distances, have as few people as possible, not to sing to colleagues, simply to behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described the spokesperson for the event of the Bethlehem Light Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels across Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship, and harmony along with the flame.
The Bethlehem light is for believers a symbol of hope, light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts have been caring for its spread for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, the little flame is thus also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.
All the latest information, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I do not have an economics education, so I am not familiar with the foundations of economics that confirm subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g., water retention), healthcare, and education will make proper use of the funds, I just don't understand why the money is being invested in agriculture, industry, and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces an unnecessary product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of a company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million notices in the corridors "xy funded/co-funded by project xy," and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This isn't support for a company that provides jobs for x number of people; this is hindering development when this company is barely hanging on and taking away contracts/employees from other companies that could expand and be more productive after its demise.
Complete agreement, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person born in the age of the internet can also fall for some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I personally think that online ads don't sway me, but then I catch myself being influenced by them anyway - it's just so sophisticated now that you can't always resist it.
For that reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament, who currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising completely...
It's all filth, in the words of a classic - I would ban the internet.
I have a feeling that this belief has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
I won't believe in something that the majority believes in and that makes sense, I'm not a sheep after all, but I'd rather believe in something that's less probable, doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I will have my own original opinion which I will claim to be critical thinking.
Certainly, I won't believe everything the media say.
I don't trust politicians.
Television has succumbed to the trend of Christmas movies, with two hundred of them premiering this year.
Los Angeles – Cinemas, television stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have succumbed to the trend of Christmas movies and this year they will present a record number of more than two hundred premieres to their viewers.
The operator of the movie database IMDb calculated it.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic movies has been scoring with audiences in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times as many Christmas movies were made as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database only included those films in its total that have the word Christmas in their title, so in reality there will be many more holiday movies.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is particularly associated with fairy tales, while globally, movies such as Home Alone, Love Actually, or the classic Christmas story It's a Wonderful Life from 1946 are popular.
The real boom in Christmas movies, however, began in 2009 when the American cable television channel Hallmark came out with a special film series, the BBC website recalled.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began tuning its viewers into Christmas as early as October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competitor station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on the schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total count.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter as much, what's important is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, the author of a book on Christmas movies titled I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described this genre with a hint of exaggeration.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a bit of peace for at least two hours amidst all that holiday madness and the craziness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark television uses the same formula for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end, a misunderstanding arises, which, however, is successfully resolved, and the two kiss.
It's the same thing over and over again, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for covid-19 and will not take part in the final F1 race.
At the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1, only nineteen drivers will take part.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not compete in the final race of the season.
Haas team will thus send only one car to the track.
In the last race of the season, he had to attack for a better placement from the 20th position, which he secured in the qualification.
Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not ultimately participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for covid-19.
On the starting grid, therefore, only nineteen cars will appear, with Mick Schumacher, Mazepin's teammate, taking to the track from the last place, and Max Verstappen starting from first, who will compete directly for the title with Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepin is according to Haas team statement quite alright and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine, as he was asymptomatic.
Now she is in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all involved parties," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a substitute driver to the race, nor can they.
A potential substitute would have to go through qualification or participate in rides during another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not struggling with COVID-19.
At the start of the just-ending season, Kimi Räikkönen had COVID-19, last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
For this, they can lock you up too.
And no one will care what the boss said.
From a legal perspective, COVID is on the list of infectious diseases.
So in the same group as HIV, plague, hepatitis, or typhus.

c) if such an act violates an important obligation arising from his employment, profession, position, or function, or imposed on him by law, or
d) if such an act causes serious harm to health.
(3) The perpetrator shall be punished by imprisonment for three to ten years if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes serious harm to the health of at least two persons or death.
(4) The perpetrator shall be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if he causes the death of at least two persons by the act referred to in paragraph 1.

Gold, silver, and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze you!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the maker put half a year of work and all their savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, we never really wore sweaters at home," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours on his work over six months.
Silk bought in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2000 decorative crystals were provided by Swarovski company.
The silver stars were then adorned with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness," the creator praises their work, which they do not however recommend to wash.
And there is one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I need to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Sappers, scouts, and drone pilots could set out even before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help Polish colleagues with protecting the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states in connection with several months of actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omicron variant spreading in South Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class."
Direct contact with previous cases from ZŠ Adamov has not been proven," said Ciupek.
In the region, six cases appeared during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant for our six cases – it is being conducted by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Health in Prague," stated the director.
She added that it involves two nurses from one department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils from the Adamov elementary school.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, four are asymptomatic.
No one suspected of Omikron traveled abroad.
None of the mentioned traveled abroad, nor anyone from their families, nor was there any contact with anyone who stayed abroad.
None of the mentioned individuals have any connection to the water polo championship, stated Ciupek.
Chief Hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that an international water polo tournament that took place in Brno a few weeks ago is being investigated.
The team also included players from the South African Republic and one Belgian player fell ill upon returning.
California will restrict gun sales.
She wants to proceed like Texas in banning abortions.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to implement a ban on the sale and production of certain firearms by using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of an embryonic heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation when suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to Friday's position of the U.S. Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in effect, even though it goes against the nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict, which established the right to abortion generally across the entire USA up to about the 24th week of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now decide on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical question that arises from the innovative construction of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban was, in this case, transferred to the public, thereby preventing its challenge by the usual legal process by Texas Republicans.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the preservation of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas's maneuver to protect its law," said the California governor.
"If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He reportedly tasked his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the minister of justice on measures that would authorize public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
Homemade weapons that lack serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are referred to in this way.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault rifles, ghost gun components, or kits for their production in California.
"If creating a threat of private lawsuits is the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets, then that is exactly what we should do," said the California governor.
The AP agency notes that California had banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the local ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban now using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in her dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict warned of the expansion of this legal mechanism to other American states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant complete immunity to the Texas abortion ban against judicial review, and allowed abortion clinics to continue with lawsuits against selected officials of the southern U.S. state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase where it is gradually determined what the vaccination scheme will look like, and also improvements to the vaccines themselves are made based on the results.
Studies on the effects of the 4th dose are already pouring in from Israel on a large scale.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like every other vaccine, in time it will have its own vaccination schedule, it's just too early for that now.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine should come to market, based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises up to 10 times greater efficacy.
You can easily leave the amount of material as is.
But reconsider WHAT is learned.
Since the time of Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology have advanced somewhat, and memorizing phone directories and copying textbooks into notebooks no longer make much sense and are truly a waste of time.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting contrary to the law if it used its new powers to stop payments to Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan regarding the utilization of 36 billion euros from the union fund for the recovery of economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and implement a mechanism that would allow the withdrawal of EU subsidies from countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the head of the small Solidarna Polska party, without whose votes the current government would lose its slim majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget, which we also contribute to, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical stance on EU access than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary has gone through during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subjugate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, sets "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw faces "a political dictate carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of such an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never agree to such concessions to Brussels that would result in limiting the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree for Poland to have the status of a colony," he declared.
But to figure it out... At our Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I also ran into one yogurt multiple times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves, I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's true, in that narrow section there were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there's an avoidance, I won't even set foot in any supermarket, sales or no sales. The golden shop on the square, they may not have such a wide selection, but they usually have absolutely everything I need and it's all well-organized, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl as if I were taking a vacation.
And I don't care at all anymore.
For two years, I've been observing how data is handled here as if it were manure; the majority of vaccination opponents are only slightly more out of touch than the majority of vaccination proponents.
Rational discussion is indeed taking place at an expert level, but only extreme opinions are reaching the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Forbid everything, allow everything.
Colorful pies instead of robust analyses.

Phew, I feel relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and I wish you all a nice day.
I was punished with a wooden spoon in my childhood.
It was never about the grades, it was mostly because I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehaved (reading instead of going to sleep, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without a warning, mom always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get smacked (sometimes even after being caught again, she would just bring the spoon and place it so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get spanked on the butt (over clothing).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (when reasonable and moderate) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than to words.
In my opinion, the important part is the warning section because it gives the child a choice in a way to either disobey and be punished or to improve and avoid punishment.
In the end, a warning was usually enough for me to start listening.
Defense of the system
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl responded to a journalistic question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him – whether it is a sacred document, sworn upon and taught about in school from an early age, or rather an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he definitely leaned towards the first conception.
Once we agreed on democratic rules of our life in the institute, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be sparing with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question at that time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes has been increasingly emerging among lawyers.
The constitution is being tested by situations that its creators (among them Vojtěch Cepl) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of the directly elected president.
In one thing though, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions into their texts must be well thought out.
The constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a kind of governance order consisting of individual rules that set boundaries for politicians in the game.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we restrict politicians with bans.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not discriminate, in FN Brno they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby.
Even though it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with mainly recently.
"We know that children are endangered and affected less than adults, with about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, the head physician of the Clinic of Pediatric Anesthesia and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Medical Faculty of Masaryk University, told Novinky.
The course is usually much simpler, easier, often occurs without symptoms.
There are, however, pediatric patients who are seriously ill with coronavirus, which we have seen especially recently," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at the clinic for pediatric infectious diseases.
Seriously ill children with coronavirus have only recently been in the ICU.
Children with post-COVID syndromes were continuously on the ward throughout the entire year, according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, which means inflammation of the lungs that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and even several-month-old infants.
In hospitals, there are also children in serious condition due to coronavirus.
"At present, a child of several months as well as an adolescent age is in our care," said the head physician.
However, she is pleased that in the children's hospital of University Hospital Brno, so far no child deaths have been recorded due to the coronavirus.
As of December 6th, there have been six deaths of children aged 0 to 14 years in the Czech Republic according to the available data.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only on the coronavirus ward – the cooperation of a psychologist is an integral part.
At the same time, it also points out the fact that, just as in adults, vaccination in children mitigates the course of the disease and also reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend the application of the booster dose even in children," added the doctor.
In the rest area, you can only walk on marked paths.
But those quiet zones are not so big.
They are visible on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
Generally in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the game reserve).
Skiing/biking in the forest off marked trails is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course, it's not enforced so much outside of national parks).
How does a conductor exercise?
Music is playing in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
He was weaned by the Liberec opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can perform practically any repertoire and as a conductor, he not only works at the F. Šalda Theatre in Liberec but also, for example, in Pilsen at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
Collaborates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, or the Podkrkonoší Symphony Orchestra.
China is creating the impression of a managed infection and that the authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better.
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression of having managed the infection and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has launched a healthcare and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was deflecting criticism for failing to stop an infection that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infected cases.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in many places in the fight against the coronavirus, for example in the worst-hit Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: hey, don't you want a little elephant?
I have it and it's terrific.
The wife is happy because he grazes the grass, washes the car with a trunk, and the children play with him.
Just great.
If you want, I'll sell you the little elephant for 5000.
Friend: alright, let's do a high five, it's going to be great...
After a while they meet and the one who bought it complains: Dude, what kind of elephant did you sell me????
The lawn is trampled, there are giant turds everywhere, the car is broken down, the kids are afraid of it, and my wife wants to get a divorce.
The one who sold it says: You speak unpleasantly about the little elephant; you won't sell the little elephant like that...
World events are dominated by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states holds true, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
So far, it works at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15, or 20 years.
But perhaps in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will succeed.
That occurred to me as well and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm quibbling over words.
I'm just going on the assumption that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is no longer clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence says "all American forces," including their weapons, and that I know American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I therefore expect that it is already included in that broad concept and there is no need to further specify it with American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just quibbling :D
Whether it is this way or that, it is an absurd request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the tamarin monkey Milly.
Terrifying footage shows the moment a frightened monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey hot dogs, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The magisterial court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun newspaper reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts, who have been taking care of Milly after her abuse, have stated that they have never seen a cosmonaut so terrified.
Milly spent nearly two years in rehabilitation with the workers at Monkey World in Dorset and now she is happily playing again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother of four has admitted to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the magistrates' court in Gwent, she was given a twelve-week prison sentence suspended for one year.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on animal breeding and must pay court costs equivalent to 12,000 crowns.
Team leader of Small Monkeys, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyerová, said: "Milly is doing fine, but the rehabilitation will continue further."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cringed and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
And now, as she has settled down and is content with the male, the sight of new people can still induce panic in her.
The psychological scars from the abuse will haunt her forever, Sawyer adds.
The abuse of Milly came to light after Gwent police discovered horrifying footage on the woman's phone following a raid on her apartment on drug charges.
In the footage, you can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
In the next video, you can hear Holland offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to possessing cocaine with the intent to sell it.
In her house, cocaine worth 1600 pounds (equivalent to just under 50 thousand crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that ancient time if you bravely leap over the entire 20th century three times in a row?
Do you mean that in the first grade you take the same things as in the sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of cramming, when nobody, with a few exceptions, cares if you know it or understand it.
Mainly write a test for a 1 and then no one cares anymore.
Go out on the street and randomly ask people if they can determine the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone has been through it, and the vast majority won't even scratch themselves and will tell you that they don't give a damn.
So what the fuck are we learning this for?
I am a big fan of general knowledge and the fact is that people don't want and don't need it.
At that moment it's pointless and you'll never get it through to them anyway.
Partially, it is learned for the many people who will need that particular thing.
But seriously, that remark about not needing all this stuff just to stand at the machine—I meant it quite seriously... ...because you just don't need it.
Moreover, we are slowly entering a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(The reason for this in our country is probably also our communist past and the incitement against intellectuals and elites) However, the cost of having barbarians manning those machines is simply too high.
If, for example, journalists were able to count, then perhaps covid would never have reached these proportions here.
Married at First Sight: Kadri's and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave right away," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the nosy questions of curious fans about what disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
Between Kadrim and Andrea, there were tensions from the beginning of the experiment.
The main issue was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move there to be with him, at least until he returned permanently to the Czech Republic.
She resolutely refused that.
And as it turns out, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather evolved into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri immediately retaliated in response to Andrea's accusations of lying, gambling, and debts.
Kadri's now ex-wife's alleged honesty did not sit well with even his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on these kinds of things at all, and we never really talked about them much in the family either.
I definitely don't want to evoke any pity.
But when I see someone trying to publicly harm and tarnish the reputation of someone I love so much, I just can't help myself!
I am sorry that I have to do this in this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for becoming a person of character and helping our family when we needed it the most, even considering how young he was.
The more it saddens me when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would terribly wish for everyone to know Kadri as I do, our close ones and family do, it's stated in the confession in response to the words of Andrea.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and know how it really was, she added uncertainly.
A drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what for.
Cchao began his robbery spree in a residential area parking lot, where he attempted to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole an equivalent of just under 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then nothing better occurred to him than to climb up to the 5th floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
In footage from a security camera, he is then captured walking away down the street from the scene of the crime while eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they had been, and he called the police.
She subsequently detained Cchaa.
The man confessed that on the day in question he had consumed some alcohol.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob while he was drunk.
The whole matter is currently under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is conditional on the state of pandemic emergency.
When that is cancelled, the law will not be effective.
The law indeed limits the scope of business operations
Isn't that reason enough for you?
The right to assembly will be limited, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters came to the Saturday elections to the representative bodies of four municipalities.
On Saturday, people elected new municipal councils in the towns of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region, and in Rovné in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councilors in these municipalities has fallen below the number of councilors determined by law, or the elected councils there have disbanded.
Of the total of 28 mandates, 99 candidates competed on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
In it, there were a total of four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils and, above all, the closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, stated the Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that due to the covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, the Saturday elections were won by the Association of Independent Candidates, which gained 27.76 percent of the votes and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means gaining two mandates.
Two seats in the council were also won by Citizens for Komňa, receiving the support of 18.52 percent of voters.
Jana Křižková, the incumbent mayor of the municipality who is a member of the Soukromníci, also made it back onto the council.
The Comňans – independent candidates – obtained one mandate in the assembly.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the association Pro Rovnou prevailed.
Obtained 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeat elections in Lužice in the Most region were once again won by the Association of Lužice and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the vote and, just as in 2018, therefore has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The candidate from the Local for People party finished second with 43.27 percent of voters' support and will therefore have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
In Nová Ves in the Liberec region, independent candidates Hope for Nová Ves won over the ANO Movement.
For the association of independent candidates, 59.88 percent of voters voted and thus they gained four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
YES received 40.12 percent of the votes and against the regular elections in 2018, it strengthened, gained one more mandate, and has three.
The voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the State Electoral Commission will discuss the election results.
Subsequently, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign policy?
I think you know well all the things these people are writing to you here.
You're just playing the fool so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, then it's sad.
I am not claiming that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like many church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, for them to look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I'm bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, e.g. the Thirty Years' War
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster if you like, but the state and the church should not be involved with each other.
A man fell head down from twelve meters.
He survived the crash into the concrete.
Incredible fall survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, who was attended to by the rescuers of the regional Medical Rescue Service.
Emergency center workers of the region took over an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two EMS crews - medical and paramedic - were immediately dispatched to the scene.
Upon arrival at the scene, the paramedics found that the twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and landed headfirst on concrete!
In Vítkovice, the coal caught fire.
But not as it should, and firefighters went into action.
At the moment of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate life-threatening danger.
The attending physician intubated his airways, ensured artificial lung ventilation, and after further pre-hospital emergency care measures, the ambulance transported him to the further care of the Ostrava Trauma Center, informed the spokesperson of the Moravian-Silesian Region Emergency Medical Services, Lukáš Humpl.
I have greater concerns about the inadequate responses of the public and authorities than about the coronavirus.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic represents a challenge for politicians and officials, but the foremost line of defense against the infection is primarily doctors and healthcare staff.
From their point of view, how serious is the situation?
We are asking military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a fantastic gala evening full of interesting results.
At UFC 269, things were happening.
Outsider Julianna Peña managed to defeat the legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira at lightweight did not hesitate, he showed a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also recorded a victory, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought the women's bantamweight bout between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the mutual battle as a proverbial "dwarf," for Nunes had not lost in seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The beginning of the duel moreover followed in the spirit of the paper assumptions.
Nunesová started her quest for victory quite actively and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
Peňová, however, did not allow herself to be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully attempted to attack using an armlock.
The second round was gripping and very thrilling for MMA fans.
Both rivals exchanged a multitude of excellent strokes and hard hooks.
Peña additionally got Nunes to the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up the effort and acknowledge the attack.
The American woman thus prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier was doing better, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, attempting to overcome his opponent with an armlock.
Although he didn't manage it very well at first, he then built up great pressure, got his opponent on their back, and showered them with a series of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira demonstrated a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap out due to the strangulation.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier lost for the first time in two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a dominant victory, having landed a hard right cross on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he finished him off with a series of precisely aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years she has lost.
That hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem determining whether it is masculine, feminine, or neuter.
However, there is also a fairly large group of nouns for which gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
In declension, they take on dual endings and in some cases remain in an indeclinable form.
For example, the words "svízel" or "kyčel" are of both masculine and feminine gender; in the first case, they are declined according to the pattern "stroj," and in the second case according to the pattern "píseň."
In another group of nouns, there are different forms already in the first case of singular, for example: "řádek/řádka", "kedluben/kedlubna", or "brambor/brambora" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are literary, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example, "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case, the Moravian variant is colloquial. Similarly, other Czech-Moravian pairs of words are treated the same way: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih", etc.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally indeclinable, but gradually they have adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image," which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "bufet," which remained indeclinable in the neuter gender, but in masculine, it has endings according to the pattern "hrad."
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like directly on the Greek borders?
On the Greek-Turkish border, there is tension due to the increasing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to head to the southern border of the Schengen Area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take the uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
For three months we haven't seen blue skies and we've been choking, describes a journalist from Sydney
Devastating fires, with which Australia has been grappling for the fourth month, have killed almost three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and have devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the residents themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to preempt the drastic impacts, as critics claim?
And what will the world have to prepare for in the future in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with the journalist from Sydney, Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
Therefore, it is always written about everyone absolutely everywhere.
For people, it is uncomfortable to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how terribly widespread it is, so they try to gloss it over.
I don't personally know anyone who was falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how those people are often treated by their surroundings or even the police.
Victims should always be believed.
It has become a trend that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and a spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large portion of the accusations are made-up" and that it is a "trend" you are only helping sexual predators.
The Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families lack the money to complete them
The prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in the last weeks and months.
Many people ended up in a difficult situation because of that.
She does not have the funds to complete the construction of the family homes and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
Apart from the cost of materials, the price of construction work is also increasing.
People thus do not have enough money to finish already started single-family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the better case, people are moving into unfinished and uninspected houses.
In the worse case, the unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgages and also pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
Every year we build two to three family houses and it happened with fifty percent of them.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to adhere to certain contractual things, even though the material has become more expensive.
"So we're working without profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
Many people are yet to have financial problems.
If they counted on the house construction costing five million, now it's going to cost them seven.
I think that some will wait," Slivoň added.
The materials that increased in price the most were copper, iron, and also plumbing and heating equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates from construction-related fields, and the influx of foreign workers is being slowed by the pandemic.
At the moment, the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favorable.
"In October, the building authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than the previous year," Křeček specified.
We are doing well and we are going to be even better.
Real vision is lacking, says the ČRO commentator – mujRozhlas
The entry into the new year was traditionally accompanied by the addresses of politicians, in addition to the classic celebrations.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and the leader of ANO Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message from President Miloš Zeman, the heads of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What fundamental have we learned?
I find the thesis to be great precisely because I have my own topic that I chose, it builds on my bachelor's, I always work on it all year round and then I write the written part in a week or two.
State exams with us are totally chill, as long as someone isn't a complete buffoon and has retained something in their head, the committee won't unnecessarily grill them on theory.
I, for instance, studied for my finals for a week, and when I was at wit's end, the committee would always try to steer me towards some logical deduction, which I would immediately understand, and I got it right.
Regarding those projects, I know people who will pay someone to do their semester project for them (we've done it many times, really beneficial, teaches a lot) and then they just learn the project and are all set.
In my opinion, it's great when at the end of the course there is an exam that reflects the knowledge gained from the project, not just a defense.
Everything is okay, but don't flood emails and phone calls, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same jerk as them.
Those people at the embassy might not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something might happen to them.
But you can just as well put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Perhaps it should be positioned in such a way that it reaches down to Xi Jinping's butt or something like that.
I agree, even though Insta throws spanners in the works for artists.
If you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will drop to the absolute minimum.
Moreover, they keep changing which function is more important, whether it's like, comment, or save.
It's been pissing me off a lot lately, so I might have to stoop to TikTok, where a lot of artists from my industry are successful and almost swear by it.
In the end, I might even be happy if something more user-friendly came along, something that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists.
Statement of the Workers' Party in the Donbas
Union – yes, breakup – no, the opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion in the photograph.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8th, 1991, the largest geopolitical catastrophe in human history occurred.
In the Białowieża Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any lawful authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open indulgent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of the pen, they "cancelled" a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
With the dissolution of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the nineties, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even without considering the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet Republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Before, the same people who in one sitting in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, and severed fourteen republics from the largest world power, which had previously been economically connected in a single mechanism.
If we look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the military, the rise of criminality, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of Orange Revolutions, NATO's expansion eastward, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all these are the results of geopolitical capitulation, giving up first the socialist bloc, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a "power vacuum."
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered in haste was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken primarily due to the events from the end of the eighties and the beginning of the nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a high-turnover supermarket may not necessarily correspond with its quality and grade.
It's Monday, and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I will buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making dinner out of it on Thursday.
In an alternate reality where I don't buy that meat on Monday, the chain will reduce its price to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the change in its price makes it a burden for my digestive system?
Or I wait until Thursday, and that meat will be discounted to 69 CZK/kg one day before the expiration date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - with nothing.
These talks about how if something is cheap, it must definitely be bad, spoiled, or low-quality are really retarded, to tell you the truth. ;-)
Just recently, I was walking in Brno to Hlavas and in the underpass, young ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take things like that to help the temp workers, they can't throw it out...
Well, the brochure was full of folksy wisdom and conservative views on how the world works, but there was nothing about God anywhere, I was confused, but I suspected it would be some kind of propaganda.
After finishing reading, I found out who published it and in the end, it turned out to be scientology.
Well, it was good stuff, full of totally unnecessary lessons, like I should wash myself and not be a wimp.
Waste of paper, for this the rainforests wouldn't need to be cut down.
I experienced something similar with a former girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to accommodate that person because you like them without realizing how messed up the situation is.
She threatened me several times that she would hurt herself because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she burst into tears and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
For about a year it was a great relationship but then another half year went by and she started to go crazy.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that we were breaking up and lied to her that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and so she wouldn't go into a frenzy again.
Such a person will drain you of feelings, emotions, and overall joy.
Prefer to keep a distance
When insurance companies are furiously being robbed by buying loads of tests and quickly going after the positives, who wouldn't even know about that terrible disease if it weren't for the test.
The only thing we achieve is complications for companies, carriers, and others, because their employees got five days of house arrest due to the random number generator.
In the West, they have already stopped with that nonsense and recognized that it's not worth dealing with a disease weaker than that famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and still needs to steal something and boost his ego by inventing hassles.
I see that the old good junk is coming back to us again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unseemly business, MLM recruiting is once again coming into the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises about product training and business skills quickly turned into "you don't need to worry about that, just bring in people."
Honestly, I was interested in the products that I offer, because I wanted to help people, however, the trainings were more about how to scare a person and talk them into it.
When the first earned money came in, one quickly realized that if one wants to earn, one has to hustle a certain number of products each month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable areas, so one felt like a door-to-door pots salesman.
But what I can say, it was a valuable experience, one learned not to jump on every bait and to thoroughly verify information.
At the same time, I wouldn't put everyone in the same boat.
In this business, there are people who are successful and even beneficial to others, but they certainly won't boast about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
In the corporation where I work, I haven't experienced many such things.
HR is calm, managers mind their own management and they don't really stick their noses into anything.
Regular evaluations do happen, in a way it takes place here it's quite feasible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what was achieved and what wasn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation rather than someone assessing you based on certain numbers, and so on.
Company events are also optional.
But we are also kind of unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes one feels like we are like an almost-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation, you know.
But as long as it works and we get results, they don't bother us too much.
The Czech woman who was missing in Britain has passed away.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, the British police have been searching unsuccessfully for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, outgoing Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherské Hradiště had been found dead.
The British police this afternoon unfortunately confirmed to our representative office in London that they have found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With respect to the family, we will not be providing more information about the case.
My sincere condolences, Kulhánek stated on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on the bus on her way home from work, before getting on she was supposed to withdraw some money from the ATM.
Her colleagues from work reported her disappearance five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began to search for her, and Interpol listed her among the missing worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police detained a man in this connection several days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he is suspected of, but it has not been disclosed.
In four municipalities, they gifted themselves new councils towards the end of the year.
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region, and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of council members in these municipalities has fallen below the legally prescribed number, or the elected councils have disbanded.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates were vying for 28 mandates.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men received the mandate.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
For the new elections to the councils in the aforementioned four municipalities, a total of 13 candidate lists have been registered.
For the 28 representative positions, 36 women and 63 men were competing.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a fairly challenging, but successful year for us.
In it, four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils and especially the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place.
We mostly had to work under more demanding epidemic conditions, which required better equipment and personnel support, evaluated Eva Krumpová, the first vice-chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49 am.
On Monday, the State Electoral Commission will discuss the voting results and after approval, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we are dealing with a fairly dangerous contagious disease here, but it went smoothly without major complications.
To come to terms with how idiotically a large part of the population at all its levels behaves towards it, I still have a problem with that.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be removed from the office of president and become ineligible to hold it again.
The chance of that actually happening is, as others here mention, very small.
Moreover, I'm not sure if shredding documents could even be considered high treason.
Treason is such an act by which the President of the Republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex for an entire year is increasing
More and more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
It mainly concerns people with religious beliefs, the DailyMail newspaper's website reports.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sexual activity increased from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported not having sexual intercourse in the last year are more numerous than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decrease in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them could be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
However, the presence of media, social networks, or video games, which make sex a lesser and lesser priority for young people, could have also contributed.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
In married people, sexual activity is more frequent, with only 5% of them stating that they had been without sex in the last year for 2021.
Among free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also contributed to by the fear of premarital sex and religious beliefs.
Even though married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married men and women under 35 is still decreasing.
Young people are divided in their opinion on premarital sex; about 30% consider it a bad thing, while approximately 70% think that it's okay.
"It is true that among single individuals in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior is shifting this trend," Stone says about these thirty percent.
For the majority of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious beliefs.
Since 2008, among single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20% to almost 60%.
Among the "less faithful," the trend increased from 10 to 20 percent," Stone declared.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activities, such as less social interaction and especially less social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower among unemployed people or those with lower incomes.
Another reason could be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby "substituting" this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown in the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The entire mandating of vaccination against covid is about whether society should force a portion of the population to engage in behavior they do not want, but which can save their lives.
It is a relatively difficult question, the one that interests me the most personally is the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we don't order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be blamed for the death of an eighty-year-old person who actually didn't know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he overheard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get vaccinated and in the end, he caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think that we can be blamed for the death of a stubborn vaccination opponent, who here alongside SPD and KSČ, rants about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly inferred that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners most likely belong to the second group, thus they will indeed be able to blame themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter in the Czech Republic so far has brought one of the smallest amounts of snow in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts cannot do without artificial snow; the weather also complicates the preparation of the cross-country skiing event Jizerská padesátka.
Is it a trend or an exception?
What will little snow mean for the battle against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one anecdote, but it's not about god-botherers.
Once in high school, our teacher led us across the whole city to the boathouse so we could take a boat ride on the river.
On the way there, we walked down quite a wide street and whom do we see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they all came down on us.
Fortunately, I escaped, but they started talking to one of my friends.
When she left them, we asked her along with the teacher what she had told them.
They asked me if I supposedly want to save my soul.
I told them that I have no soul," she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boathouse.
We are terribly spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, Orozovič says
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, following previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must jointly demonstrate that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The chancellor believes that the crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border should be addressed through diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy group", which comprises France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially induced a migration crisis and is using people as live targets and weapons, as night after night we record a hundred attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
With the chancellor, he discussed further sanctions so that Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz assured, according to the DPA agency, that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukashenko regime.
A drunken Polish nun caused an accident, she tried to cover it up.
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but this time it was driven by another nun who tried to take the blame.
When the police officers informed her that she could still lose her driving license for failing to give way while driving and leaving the scene of an accident, she came out with the truth, the TVN24 station reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle and had asked her for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breathalyzer test and after finding she had over two per mille of alcohol in her blood, they immediately revoked her driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she would have to answer for her actions in court.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
But Juraj Šajmovič did not keep an eye on his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have taken a liking to American tales about canine pets.
But they forgot about an essential thing: the laws of the craft of filmmaking.
After the kitschy film by F. Brabec Gump - pes, který naučil lidi žít, now another film We Keep Watch Here is vying for the audience's emotions in the cinemas.
Co-writer and director in one, Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows up on his previous film I'm Watching Here from 2012.
Talking dachshund Hugo returns to the scene, along with some familiar characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, owners of a struggling Šumava guesthouse, hence start inviting dog owners, Julie's father with his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but an adolescent girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) struggled with narrative techniques already in their previous dog film, but at least it amused the children and the dog.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's summarize it.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to superstitious delusions in her desire for a child, and when the "right constellation” arises, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever the coordinates may dictate – on the hood of a car or a church tower (naturally during an ongoing excursion with a local guide). The retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, accidentally shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, causing her to fall into a coma, after which she is taken away by her family to the hospital, allowing a miraculous healing process to unfold in the heart of the Bohemian Forest solitude with the help of a dog.
Nothing against nature's cleansing treatment and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
However, the viewer wonders at the hodgepodge full of incredible situations and characters that was necessary for this message.
A pair of female thieves from the staff, a dog owners' competition, a Šumava charlatan, police officers arriving at a tip-off to search for "drugs" and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal over herbs – and of course, a sly family at the guesthouse gets them drunk.
When the heroine wakes up from a serious coma and immediately sits permed and made-up with a cigarette at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and steak as a cured vegetarian, one cannot help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "it sometimes happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to construct pivotal situations, a sense for the characters' traits, the point, and directorial leadership.
The acting performances are uneven, the editing is inept, and the overall impression is messy.
Regardless of how Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková, or Nela Boudová try to hold their ground in their roles, they don't have much to work with.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava nature by the cinematographer Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot, and witty remarks, let alone the more vulgar colloquial expressions that the characters commit.
Not even longstanding membership in the Dachshund Breeders Club is an argument - as in the case of the lady producer.
Behind good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft if one is to tell a believable story.
In this case, it did not succeed.
For a good family movie, there is a bit too much eroticism and a minimal sense of the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurishly conceived piece wouldn't make the cut.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing precisely from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing; here it's visible how little you understand about it, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want it, the answer will always be no.
If you kept listening to such kids, you might change your opinion.
It's a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is, at the same time, the only season of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have recorded at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israeli Meteorological Service.
For instance, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term average precipitation for November.
The two-day rain this week was thus more of an exception.
For us, it's good.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasím Aškar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is sporadic and irregular.
Forests are dependent on winter rains.
Without them, they wither and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, has filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Hydrologists had warned of the drought long ago.
"It can be expected that depending on global warming and climate changes, there may be a decrease in precipitation here," predicted Uri Schor, the spokesperson for the Israel Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel knows how to help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weaker countries such as Lebanon, Syria, or Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, the number of tanker trucks is increasing.
Water mains and private wells are indeed drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the last two years," reported Imád Sulejman, a tanker truck driver, in September.
In Iranian Isfahan, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has just experienced its driest November in many recent years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israeli Defense Minister stated that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and that he informed Washington about the preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz stated on Saturday that he has instructed the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is staying in the USA, is trying to convince Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna had not brought "any progress" and that world powers "understand that the Iranians are toying with them".
About 3 years ago, this happened to me too.
I liked the young lady a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she actually wanted from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicion of the pyramid scheme was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I bothered the young lady for a while longer with doubts and questions, and then thanked her and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a scoundrel, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers set out to the mountains over the weekend, with plenty of snow and nice weather waiting for them.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of skiing enthusiasts this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the workweek, there is no shortage of snow, and thanks to that, some ski resorts have started operating.
Skiers were not deterred even by the obligation to prove themselves with a COVID certificate at ski lifts.
While the tow operators do not complain about the lack of customer interest, some ski equipment rental services report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people took to the cross-country trails and ski slopes in the Liberec Region over the weekend.
The weather favored the skiers, today offering both sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really went well from that Friday evening skiing when we had the first skiers on the hill," praised the interest the director of the Ještěd Sports Complex, Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people set off for the first weekend of skiing in the new season to the Jeseníky as well.
Open, for example, were the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region.
Weekend attendance was very respectable, with an estimated 400 people coming on both Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, the representative of the ski resort in Branná, Rostislav Procházka, was full of praise.
Operators of ski resorts may only sell ski passes to individuals who are vaccinated or are within the period after recovering from COVID-19.
Except for a few exceptions, people are prepared and present the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told ČTK.
"We have recorded only a handful of incidents," he added.
Some rental shops and ski equipment stores are reporting less interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava store Skiopava.
Increased demand is expected during the period of skiing courses.
The director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, David Šinták, also feels that due to Covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as there used to be.
By this time before the pandemic, we were already almost loaned out.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazy due to the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the rental shop in the Novako area at Boží Dar is experiencing high demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and now customers have to order them in advance.
"We begin renting out cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said the facility operator Pavlína Nováková.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is, according to her, also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and wealthy not to leave abroad, they must have the opportunity to experience a quality life like abroad.
Certainly, a socialist healthcare system does not belong to the category where it is often not possible to find a dentist or a medical specialist.
Smart and capable people who have no property here are leaving the country.
The owner of the company won't just leave abroad like that.
I absolutely agree with the rest.
If these people won't live well in the Czech Republic and if these people won't see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply won't live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began when one beautiful day Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly annual emigration increased by tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is the elections at all.
If life gets bad here, some traditional V4 lunatic could also win.
The young and educated will leave, only his supporters and people whose property cannot be stuffed into an airplane will remain.
Terrifying photo!
Langmajer's blood alcohol content due to a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the movie "The Island" led by Jiří Langmajer (55) was enjoying tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor, meanwhile, posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for filming?
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is completely unlike her behavior and we are starting to worry a lot about her," Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district, where Srncová worked, said in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman according to her left work on Sunday, November 28, around 7:45 pm and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
"We have immense concerns for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," stated a group of medical facilities in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harman is also calling on the public to cooperate, having highlighted Srncová's case during a press conference on Saturday.
"She has been missing for several days now, she is only 32 years old, from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried sick," said the Labor politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have an especially great responsibility to try to find her because she was outside her native country, away from family and working here for our healthcare," Harmanová stated.
The police had previously detained one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the news website BBC, however, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and definitely not with 30 BTGs (i.e., about 5 divisions).
I am not underestimating Ukraine like this either.
These are not "huge amounts," but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is starting to get sick of our intervention.
I quoted above.
I don't know what led you to conclude that Russia wants war.
War is a damn expensive joke and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparison with the situation in '38 is off in so many points that I don't even know where to start.
Now I can compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it does not intend to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia annexed those ridiculous republics.
That's pretty much it and that would correspond to the "concentration" on the borders.
Indeed, agreements must be kept...
In Prague, new timetables have been in effect since Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services.
Passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) can expect several changes from Sunday, particularly affecting suburban services.
New lines have been established, some have changed their route, and others have disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly being integrated into the integrated system.
In the capital, from Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice will stop at Zahradní Město station.
In suburban rail transport, the S7 trains will set out, which pass through the Prague main station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
At the recently commissioned station Prague-Zahradní Město, the express train R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov will now make a stop.
The PID will now expand into additional areas.
Aside from other things, buses will go as far as Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná near Jesenice, Staré Splavy, and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region, including lines extending into the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions, will be incorporated.
During integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and services on 12 existing lines will be adjusted.
From Prague's Zličín, a new bus line 405 will set off, which will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka has also been established, which replaces the discontinued train line S53.
Enhanced will be in the morning peak and over the weekend connections from Prague to Rakovník, when a new express line number 404 will be introduced.
Newly included in the PID system are lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
The backbone line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubá, and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor, and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The supplementary bus line 410 runs through Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimoň, and Jablonné v Podještědí.
Conversely, operations on a dozen Central Bohemian local lines have been newly cancelled or limited, including to Mochov, Dobříš, or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem lines and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some discontinued railway lines, or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended with connections from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk area have changed, and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket
Hello, I work the classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option for getting food is to go next door to Billa or a little further to Lidl.
Given that I don't have any activity, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthily and diet-friendly as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I'll at most buy pizza rolls and for a snack a yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy without the need for thermal processing would you recommend me to buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, that's just how it is, unfortunately.
And it's not about the trees that you necessarily have to see.
Beneath the snow, only the tip of the sapling might be hidden.
If it becomes damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying it's the only reason why they forbid us to ski off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I was not looking forward to this at all
The Czech showbiz pond has been abuzz since Friday with nothing other than the revelation of Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd's relationship.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent the fans an extensive message explaining why she kept her love secret from them for a long half-year.
"I dare say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would not be aware that Dara caught a bear, I mean, sorry, Nedved," Dara Rolins jokes, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech football player.
Apparently, he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they do not enjoy it.
And here it is.
The thing that neither of us were looking forward to, but we knew that it would eventually happen, continues the singer.
I just don't know who is worse off.
Whether those who are not at all interested and it pops up on them even from a can, or us, whose lives are dissected in detail.
As if someone wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your spouse or girlfriend are a good match, or if you insisted that everyone really knew the list of your ex-partners in detail and were acquainted with the catalog of your mistakes and faults.
That's žúžo, do you want it, it bothers Dára.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins traveled for preparations of her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has long been serving there as the vice president of the football club Juventus.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for the conclusion of Nedvěd's divorce.
With his wife Ivana, they have been separated for three years, but legally they have been their own only for the last three weeks.
Anyway, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people too, we have families, children, a past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband and just like he's there for me, I'm there for him too. In good times and in bad, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have probably already said everything important, I'm just confirming that dorms are great for the start. Most of my classmates got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two and then found sublets together, which seems to me the best option because you know who you will be living with.
Apartments are usually not advertised too far in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but looking at the offers certainly won't hurt.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's quite a bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the contrary, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and that direction are fine, besides, it's close to most of the Brno University of Technology (BUT) faculties (I don't know exactly where you are starting).
I've never looked for rent myself, but as a native of Brno, I can offer advice about Brno itself, should you need any more information. :)
That's an example of completely "normal" thinking for me.
Due to what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually completely fine that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they should learn whatever they want and pay for it themselves, or they should follow the state curriculum and the state should pay for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor take over a part of education just because they add a few crowns to the full state subsidy and as a result, be able to teach whatever they want in schools.
Such a statement loses some credibility when it is written by a person who expressed themselves this way about the petition action for the boycott of the totalitarian state two days before:
So a vote against someone getting an abortion is the same to you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
If I were you, I would consult it directly with the person who assigned you that work.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitization that (even long-time professionals) either eyeball it or write something along the lines of xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case, it is quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I would deal with that in a footnote depending on what program you are using.
If you wanted to be a diligent and hardworking student, you could look into some sign databases and find the nearest one.
But because it seems that you are drawing from some book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol that fits what is physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it by any chance more the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) rather than Odrynian?
PSS: someone has already cracked it for you here.
Look at that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what will be the "theme" of our presidency.
This is a much bigger mess than just having interpreters with them.
The idea that something would be approved because nobody understood a text is amusing.
All important approved documents are examined word for word; a basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, it's a matter for lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and interpreters work, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, with that English, it's quite interesting after the UK left the EU.
I don't understand the hate towards Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and it's completely fine.
I come home from work at 10 in the evening and never have any problem.
Saying that it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly ever set foot there.
Yes, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't :D it's definitely not that I would be afraid to go out on the street at night.
So if you're looking for relatively inexpensive housing with good access to the city center, I would go for it without hesitation.
Many apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his mistress Gelemova like a stake in a fence!
With whom will you spend Christmas?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on their Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw a wreath and for sure Lucie has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, thereby confirming Patrasová's words that he visits her often.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda remained alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently, we met with Anička, Felix, and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so Christmas never came.
I really don't know where I will be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy something for Dáda and Lucie, probably a perfume.
I am a gentleman, added Felix, who came by himself to the launch of the music video at the Richman club.
I am here alone, but I do not feel alone.
I always find someone who I enjoy talking to, says Slováček, who was happy to meet the wife of Luďek Sobota, Adriana, or the singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made that abundantly clear.
And are we Iceland to be able to afford not having soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that should be a bad argument, can you explain that to me?
I do not know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are too few police officers and they can't afford it, the same goes for firefighters, and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is barely able to defend Ostrava is the fault of previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for quite some time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not just be a food factory, says a journalist.
Czech Republic is going through the worst drought period in recent years.
According to scientists, the amount of water has decreased in mountainous and sub-mountainous regions, and places where there was previously no shortage of moisture are also recording lower rainfall totals.
The cause of the drought that prevails in much of Central Europe is climate change.
The impacts are also intensified by the way we manage the soil.
What to prepare for in connection with the drought?
And how can we help nature in tough times?
Yeah, it's going to be like that, I can barely stay upright on skates on the ice, I have no clue about playing hockey, and that tactic (that I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total trip.
And whether you are the hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Llama China," losing by two goals even when you don't have to win the match at all costs is different than when the score is even.
But anyway, when I listen to Czech commentators who point out what the referees do or don't pay attention to, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably true for all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And in my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be like always different, and that the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than won, it would probably be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases for the last 14 days are 1967 per 100,000 in the Czech Republic, 871 per 100,000 for the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13th.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
Number of daily deaths is 1132, it is the lowest daily number of dead since the end of October.
Britain faces an "inevitable" major wave of infections caused by Omicron, said Dr. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor for the UK Health Security Agency on television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be required.
Individuals infected with Omicron are already being hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to increase.
So far, no one has died from the omicron variant, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson probably broke the law by organizing a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December when a lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister from Johnson's government defended that the quiz took place "virtually," over the computer.
Of course, groups of employees gathered around computers participated in it at Downing Street.
In Britain, there is increasing pressure to remove Johnson from the prime ministerial position.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was implemented in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers, despite the lockdown, organized numerous parties.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government were making a mockery of them:
Paul Brand, commercial broadcaster ITV's editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the office of Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is facing elections in the spring, which could end Viktor Orbán's twelve-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European significance.
How fair can they be expected to be?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán were not free either.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, alters electoral district boundaries to its advantage, and employs various other minor or major tricks.
The latest one says that everyone can practically choose where they want.
This will allow Fidesz to transport voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition might succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be just as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Before, it was about not whether Fidesz would win, but by how much and whether they would also have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
For Viktor Orbán and his party, this is a great unusualness.
Won't they play even harder in an effort to maintain power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording was leaked to independent media of the parliamentary speaker and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, where he explains to the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the hints of the new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that is one of the news items.
Everything starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, mother doesn't have much patience, neither do I, dad has it for a long time, but then he snaps extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I got terribly angry as a little one, to the extent that I would lie on the ground in a convulsion and turn all blue, this happened about twice that they took me under the shower to calm down.
Sometimes they would smack me as discipline; other times, it was more that they didn't know what else to do.
I definitely have tendencies to resolve things through violence now as well, I used to fight quite a bit when I was little, now to vent I at least hit something, and when I was younger I might have slapped my parents on the hand (to avoid getting smacked too hard), so nothing extreme, but I've always had that urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is due to my explosiveness, but certainly, that upbringing also plays a part in it.
I'm afraid that I will also lose patience with my kids and handle it the same way.
I think that hitting children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially when it was no longer “educational” but out of frustration. On the other hand, perhaps every parent messes up at some point; it's probably not possible to not mess up your children at least a little, so I don't hold it against them.
It doesn't offend me in any way; I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
Customers, then, I would call those who create laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I would be interested to know if you are afraid of a loss of income?
Can we really expect that people will want and buy the product, and that you will have the means to pay the mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the process with the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial in the case of the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of the investigative reporter and his fiancée changed Slovakia.
It mobilized civil society but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top echelons of Slovak politics and justice.
How fundamental a turning point will the process signify for Slovakia?
For this, journalists are hugely to blame.
How is it possible that this petition received an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition from the deans of all medical faculties, which was released a day or two later?
Well, they let themselves be fooled and the company paid the price.
On Czech television, people were dying with COVID still half a year ago.
Another government ends and the law on involving municipalities in the selection of the repository is nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs a fundamental overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at its end, and the law that was supposed to ensure the respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorization of deep geological repository for high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The government's legislative council has suspended the discussion of the proposal, which after years of delays was submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
Its content, however, is in serious contradiction not only with the concerned communities associated in the Platform against Deep Geological Repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Municipalities expect from the law a significantly stronger enhancement of their abilities to decide on the repository, which mayors have been promised since 2011 when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech atomic law as well as the European directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law by Minister Karel Havlíček, which Platforma has at its disposal, is especially criticized by municipalities for: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process for selecting a site for the repository is inadequate and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the given location at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to seek the consent of the affected municipalities before initiating specific proceedings.
The submitted proposal of the substantive intent almost completely ignores public involvement, effectively turning municipal citizens into mere extras in the permitting process.
The proposal lacks a systematic setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching for and selecting a site for the repository, its permitting, and operation.
Representatives of municipalities in reality, according to today's legal norms, do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when searching for a site for a repository.
Only in certain permitting procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or minister whose interest it is to issue the permit.
The potential lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the conduct of exploratory or construction work.
The co-decision-making of municipalities, which the Platform calls for, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and definitely in those that have already made progress in permitting repositories, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, furthermore, another failure of public administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it concerns a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and subsequent contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for these works, according to the contract register, is to be almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Sekníčka, the deputy mayor of the village Cejle from the Hrádek area and the spokesperson for the Platform against Deep Geological Repository, said: After ministers of industry, who were only postponing the alignment of local governments' position towards state authorities in the search for a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant change from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities for such a fundamental construction in a similar way as the directly affected municipalities in the selected localities.
The platform against the deep geological repository unites 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) with the purpose of enforcing a change in the state's approach to handling spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive wastes, which will not be limited to just the deep geological repository.
The platform further advocates that the decision on selecting a site for potential storage should be contingent upon the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Actor John Goodman (69) was motivated to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything in his lifestyle for many years, eventually the doctors scared him into it.
They told him that if he doesn't lose weight, he will die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun newspaper.
He showed off his new figure in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the chubby guy from the sitcom Roseanne, he's a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing the furniture to break.
"I was putting everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a matter of, for example, a formal text, perhaps of a university level, I would probably look for ways to describe or explain 'bosse' instead.
There are multiple types of bosses for everything.
Certain games such as Dark Souls and the like have several bosses, right, and so "boss" is something like a lord/ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but they are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player doesn't directly confront them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that at all?
And then there are mini bosses.
It's not really possible to translate the word "boss" into Czech or any other language with a single term that covers all its meanings, as languages, including Czech, don't really address it (although Catalan is interesting in this regard, as it translates "boss" as the final enemy).
It is simply a computer-controlled opponent significant to the story or game in general, stronger than all previous ones and guarding the completion of a certain level or task.
The whole world is searching for Petra from London, who has been reported missing.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since December 3rd.
The Czech police also joined the search.
That 32-year-old woman from the Uherské Hradiště region has been searched for since December 7th.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called Yellow Notice because of her.
The whole world is therefore searching for Petra.
"The Czech police closely cooperate with the British police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information about the case together," she added.
The search for Petra has already been announced on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, slim, with brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from the Uherské Hradiště region.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, as such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Local Member of Parliament Harriet Harman also joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in posting flyers with Petra's face.
"We have huge concerns about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
It is not clear, however, who it was and what he had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czechia is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While the data in October indicated a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month with the approaching end of the year, the attacks significantly intensified.
We recorded a large campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for the time being.
The infected email attachment is designed to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as "Copy of repair receipt for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the attackers' activity is once again increasing.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to October data, Formbook slightly weakened in November, but still accounts for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks were ongoing continuously throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th, and 15th of November.
The Formbook most frequently contained an attachment with the .exe extension, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the term "receipt" continues to appear as well.
An appendix in Czech can then be far more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts report a significant decline and suppression of activity for the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic for several months.
Today's demonstration of smart alecks who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The procession through Prague was larger than the media reported.
Based on footage of the procession along the riverside and from my experience as a protester, I am not afraid to estimate around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the embankment as well as the bridge and the opposite riverside road.
This means a lot to people.
To the procession of about four thousand demonstrators, an unprecedented number of passersby are spontaneously joining.
I claim that something new is being born here, Radek Mokrý writes.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population has led to the fact that they found a common language.
Only the anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, etc., themselves wouldn't be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events of the Chcípl pes association are gaining popularity, it reminds me of Milion Moments for Democracy in reverse.
Sometimes I have the impression that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could emerge from this dissatisfaction; it depends not only on the influx of money, but also on whether the three-dose Pfizer vaccine becomes a four or more dose vaccine.
It definitely won't be a leftist or centrist movement, you can bet on that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multiple-dose vaccine, as it is clear that we will need to get revaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists that humanity can rightfully be proud of.
End of an era, Bulgaria has a new prime minister proclaiming change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
He has already managed to assemble a broad coalition government, which is expected to take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has lasted since April when the previous government, weighed down by anti-corruption protests, lost the elections.
The victorious parties proclaiming the fight against bribery and the abuse of power were, however, unable to come to an agreement, which led to two more snap elections.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
From the "secretly" captured footage, it's a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, concerns grew regarding the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been sought by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was traveling home from work to the south of the British capital.
According to the information about the employee of the children's hospital, not only the police but also her current employer and a female MP representing the part of London where she lived are calling.
"The disappearance of Petra is completely out of character for her, and we are starting to be very worried about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district, where Srncová worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman according to her left work on Sunday, November 28, around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her colleagues.
Srncová, according to British media, worked as a "nursing assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
"We have immense concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," stated a group of medical facilities in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
An anonymous person reported the Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (also a regional Pirate councilor), for violating copyright laws with her paintings.
The court, however, recognized that the paintings of the Little Mole in the Šumperk restaurants do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road for a month in the form of an uncovered manhole.
It was a matter of life.
The City Hall referred the complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which owns the road, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole remained gaping.
After all, the authorities cleared up responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the Road and Motorway Directorate (ŘSD) began to "intensively address the situation".
