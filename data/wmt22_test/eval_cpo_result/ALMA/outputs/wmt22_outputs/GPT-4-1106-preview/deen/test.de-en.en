The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a major customer of #PRS_ORG# and thus it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what I should include with the package so it can be tracked by you as a return.
A few days ago, I ordered the #PRS_ORG#... for €249.
Today, it costs 179€.
Honestly, I find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel the order and place a new order for the better price, or is there another way to get a credit?
I generally also believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think that it does older siblings good to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, give a quick hand, bring the bottle over, etc.
This is how they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough of a child themselves, I don't see a problem there.
If your K1 keeps himself occupied for the short time alone and it's OK for him, then that's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether that is suitable for your children.
It's not like he should swaddle the baby and accompany it for hours while falling asleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that's also where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something were actually to happen such as a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would indeed be too much responsibility for Child 1 to take care of Child 2.
Whether that's a risk you want to take is, of course, at your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime thriller a few years ago, and I can still recall almost the entire plot, but for the life of me, I can't remember the title - maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by dousing himself with food and going into his predators' enclosure.
The case is taken over by a female commissioner who, after a short investigation, comes across his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The police commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid of fire and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the place of the suicide to document it and post the photos on the internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain, causing the patients to ultimately confront their fears in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another one intentionally drives herself to death)
Facing this fear is referred to in the book as "the fight."
At the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic which involved a fire.
That is roughly the plot; I'm quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If someone is familiar with this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But that might take a while.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to have the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has a wooden splinter under the thumbnail (outer side) over the entire length.
We tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
Did not work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow is a visit to the doctor.

Due to Omicron: Johnson wants to accelerate booster vaccination campaign
New Omicron cases are worrying politicians and scientists in the UK.
By New Year, therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to accelerate the COVID-19 booster vaccination campaign even more rapidly than previously aimed for, in light of the rapidly increasing Omicron cases.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to get a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, said Johnson on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
So far, the target date was set for the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland as well.
We are facing an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Get boosted now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional Omicron cases were recorded in Great Britain, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, that was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent off an application.
Today the invitation to a conversation came by email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter," but rather a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where his/her cultural background originates from, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and just don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them are going.
The only thing that I bought today does not work.
Obviously, the chair had a non-apparent defect at the time of sale.
How can such an upholstery damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
This has been working for about ...
Not anymore for 14 days.
Therefore, I have always purchased the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for that.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write something a bit detailed here about domestic violence.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) often come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A theme that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs all too often, is that many victims do not accept help or think we cannot help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But in my profession, there are few things that affect me more than when I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears myself, is that everyone deserves to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply tolerate violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier by doing so.
Please, always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, that is incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: How good is the "League of Legends" series?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" video game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced second season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle for MHP Giants Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least young Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick, reflecting on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said: "We still have some anger in our bellies".
That did not subside after the game, but instead intensified in light of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
More than the bare result, it was the manner of the performance that was disappointing.
To exemplify, let's mention a statistic that encapsulates the entire dilemma: The three-point shooting percentage was a mere 13 percent, with 4 makes (all by young Johannes Patrick) out of an astonishing 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "After the victory in Tenerife, we just weren't focused enough and didn't execute what we had practiced."
Specifically, to move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim reacted very differently: "To win an awesome game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like being in front of 10,000 people.
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and directed the play of his team.
"The best playmaker that I have ever coached," Gleim praised yet.
Even the key players in Patrick's team, like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and came within eight points after they had already been behind 39:59.
Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time left to lament.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm) the Giants will host Skyliners Frankfurt, with a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I have changed it.
Yes, I already reached out a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have sought legal advice again and therefore have written to you once more.
We originally reported half a year ago.
Always looking immaculate: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to excite his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is touring with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that will not happen.
The scheduled concert has been moved to May 2022 - "by official order" to contain the Corona virus.
Other performances of his planned for the Advent season will also have to be cancelled for the time being, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists then want to make up for their dates already rescheduled in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe enjoyed singing a lot as a teenager.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blond hair slicked back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe has become an indispensable part of the contemporary German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Good Day, Dear Luck", he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand if it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only see the cover page but can't flip through.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new housing is created by expropriation
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with the assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies is incidentally the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens, and the Left Party wants to establish an expert commission to decide how to deal with the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not ease, however, Geywitz did not rule out discussions with the FDP within the traffic light coalition on further tightening of tenancy laws.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent control until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax anyway, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and after a few days, I realized that I forgot the last step in the payment process.
Unfortunately, the product is now no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or whether it will come again at all?
Storage bed (180 x 200 cm),
Voucher sounds great
Then I will independently redeem it with the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping itself take?
I have already cut my finger.
That is an absolute impertinence.
At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes swept through the USA.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths may have to be mourned.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
Overnight into Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms left behind a path of destruction about 320 kilometers long, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Whose Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit in the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had torn through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates up to a hundred deaths alone in the state of Kentucky, with official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I just noticed that the display cabinet #NAME# is sold out.
That's a real pity.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is there a possibility to order this showcase in another country?
When will you get in touch?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I will have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I now order the blanket that is in the shopping cart and have it delivered to Germany?
I had returned an article via the contact form or initiated a return and wanted to ask if it has been received or is being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash bonuses for getting vaccinated.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Economic Chamber, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Also, the redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - following the German model - is intended to increase the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
He switched to a company that he used to badmouth.
That does not make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and see, and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself to his old position and looked for something else.
You may do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: oh well, never mind.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please process the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Hello, Boron!
I am currently running the adventure "Across the Griffin Pass" for a group of 4 friends and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play The Dark Eye 5.
The large arc is created, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts conceived and now I am working on writing the introductory adventure and I stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further action is to unfold.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the heroes to ambush them.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, trading, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If not noticed, the goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a hollow way and flank the wagon with three on each side armed with bows, while two with spears stop the wagon.
Should it come to a fight and the heroes be defeated, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village headman, a half-elf.
Of course, the cart is gone.
Should defeat be inevitable, this half-elf along with two of his servants intervenes and comes to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you consider the deus ex machina for solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart, and now I have more confidence in my narrative again.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back.
Can you then send the return receipts, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

We didn't do anything with the chair.
Suddenly the crack was there.
I simply sat on it.
Here the lower part, so to speak the part with storage space, was damaged.
Will everything be picked up again or just the storage space part?
I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on German Sky has continually decreased, so with this post I want to vent a little.
First of all, today the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning had put the schedule far behind the planning, they still could have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is the case that, for legal reasons, Formula 1 takes precedence and therefore everything else must be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice.
Nonetheless foolish, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.
Despite that, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then, once again in F1, there was a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as neither knew that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that this opportunity exists for Verstappen.
I believe that one should simply know such basic rules if one is commenting on F1 at a pay-TV station.
It's not the first time there's been guessing about what's possible or required according to the rules; both just have constant uncertainties regarding the rules.
Generally, I don't like Roos' contrived comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL there.
In addition, there are constant sillinesses that make both appear simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter, in particular, causes a great deal of unrest in the comment section, as he obviously does not take it seriously.
Not least, advertising simply gets out of hand with Sky; in the cool-down lap, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes to advertising, as you can hear on F1TV since the German audio track has to manage without commentary right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also run less advertising during the trainings than Sky, and that as free-to-air broadcasters.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the program on Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits F1.
Unironically, apart from the advertising, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
Anyway, the spectacular F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a sensible broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
For the one here: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it's still not being delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent out on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email, and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short period of time (the fabric had a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for assistance.
Fan pumps are excellent for providing an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using air lifters.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services compared.
If the pumps are powerful enough, they can operate entire systems with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple aerators.
The MK series features one, two, or four outputs, depending on the model. Fan pumps are also suitable for creating an accent in an aquarium, for example with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a feature.
Here one could mention a treasure chest, shell, or something similar.
The MK series features a special sound-insulated construction, ensuring low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected via an air hose 4/6 mm to a diffuser or similar...and you're ready to start.
The fan pump should be at the same level, or higher than the water level and should be mounted externally.
If the fan pump sits lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent, if water were to flow backwards at any time, that the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we indicate a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, packages are packed daily and are also collected from here every day.
If everything goes well on the way, it happens very quickly.
We just want to take some precautionary measures to ensure that no one is upset just because it took a little longer than expected.
It is so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding business...of course, Corona doesn't stop here either.
Please do not rate poorly just because the delivery is delayed, as this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though we have to say at the moment…they have a damn hard time.
This also varies greatly by region.
Don't be mad at anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in a light color here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and host into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system from Blue Origin, the company founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliantly blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amidst the applause of friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they spent ten minutes and 13 seconds in flight and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
Laura Shepard Churchley, the 74-year-old daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they each paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard during his assignments and do everything himself.
She just went along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space again immediately, said the presenter.
"New Shepard" flies up to a height of 100 kilometers
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule, which was detached from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing temporary weightlessness, before the reusable object was decelerated and landed again with the aid of large parachutes.
The International Aviation Federation and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above Earth as the boundary to space, however, there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned space excursion by Blue Origin: On the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In the second one in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," was involved, as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the vice president of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With the push of a button, you can easily select whether your "Smart Stone" should glow permanently in one color or cycle through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the luminous stone maintains one light color for about a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative shade.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light proves itself outdoors all year round.
In a snowy environment, her light even stands out especially well – only a reduced duration of illumination is to be expected when the days become shorter.
Please ensure in winter that no snow impairs the function of the solar panel.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMH battery in the common mignon ("AA") size, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can obtain a suitable replacement battery from our webshop, thereby further extending the usage duration of your decorative light.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry.
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite fascinating in itself, and I don't mind working in the lab either (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical course).
Of course, I had also informed myself about career prospects before my studies, but at that time I also thought that I definitely wanted to study up to a doctorate.
Currently, however, I am having doubts, especially the career prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On one hand (Studycheck etc), you keep hearing about great job opportunities and that the profession is in high demand, while on the other hand, you keep hearing about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would be really interested:
What is your current job?
Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
### English:3) What did you study/What training did you complete?
Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your responses!
I am currently really unsure and am considering possibly dropping out of university in 2022 to do a vocational training to become an IT specialist.
If you have experiences with that, feel free to write about them as well :)
Additional stress before vacation & holiday weekends
This topic came up for me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why I'm only posting about it now.
Not only before big vacations, such as the Christmas holidays, do we experience a lot of stress at our company.
It seems that it's available before holidays as well as bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Feast of the Ascension, which is called "Ascension Day" here in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses take a bridge day, which is why it's semi-official.
Last week, therefore, a long 4-day weekend was in store.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of emails that had to be sent out before Ascension Day, job here job there, all *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that must not be the case?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also mightily annoyed.
Why this self-hostage situation over holidays?
What is the point of having holidays if we're not allowed to properly enjoy them?!
The stress, mind you, did not come from above; the colleagues were all quite independent like that.
My question is simply this: Is it just us, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed Protestant way?
Or do you also know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but hasn't bought any gifts yet.
"The nice thing is, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, one simply drives to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer to Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the festive spirit by baking cookies and doing crafts with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the contemplative days, however, she still has quite a bit to do: "For the first time I still have no gifts, I now really need to get started."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of molting and the regeneration of feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kilogram.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird keeping can be attributed exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of proteinaceous substance, the formation of a perfect plumage requires an especially rich and balanced protein diet for the bird.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during molting is based on a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin supplement should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via drinking water or with soft food.
Thank you very much, I have found it
Unfortunately, it still does not work
East German craft model of old building electric locomotive E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in operation in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably originates from the conversion proposal in the model railroader ME magazine issue 11/1968, used with signs of play and missing parts see photos, working well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn Company (DRG), designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, the model kit possibly also comes from the small series manufacturer ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is being restored to working order
The German Imperial Railway Company commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The required maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Consequently, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with jackshaft drive AEG for the delivery of the mechanical part and Siemens-Schuckertwerke for the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and afterwards found themselves on the territory of what would later become the GDR (German Democratic Republic).
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparation goods.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Dessau Reichsbahn repair shop, it was determined that all six locomotives were worthy of overhaul.
As the ongoing electrification of the Central German network progressed, there was an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight service, so in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished, with the remaining engines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44, and E 94 units that were available in larger quantities were given priority for reconstruction.
Only when it became apparent that the number of refurbishments could not be increased further for the E 94, did the E 95 come into focus for refurbishment.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the Halle P rail depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in a dedicated circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal region towards Halle, Leipzig, and Erfurt.
Problematic with increasing age was the complicated control system in the locomotives.
Thus, it often happened that relays would stick during switching operations.
Then the assistant who was constantly riding on this locomotive had to release the sliders with a hammer and wooden wedge during the journey.
Damages to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months-long downtimes for the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available, and there were no plans for a significant expansion of electric operations at that time, so the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most minor types, which is why the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, they faced the issue that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to staff electric locomotives with only one person, which, due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility conditions from the cab, would have resulted in a problem for train operations.
In mid-1969, units E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service, and they were eventually followed by the last one, E 95 01, which was retired on October 5, 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
Apart from the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heater at the main train station in Halle.
It took some time before the officials at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle exhibition in the RAW Dessau.
Since then, she has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is curated as a museum exhibit.
Since 1995, staff of the Traditional Association Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum Railway Depot Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint job, with the transformers being checked and five traction motors being operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance efforts.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to join the Central German network.
Primary area of operation was initially Silesia
Handcrafted model H0 in original packaging, good function, optical reworking on the locomotive is necessary as a DIY project, dusty, with signs of play, basement smell!!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small circulation - possibly the kit also comes from the small-series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and signs of storage.
Yes, those are the F-parts.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The center beam is supported by two feet..unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What shall we do now?
I can't put the bed together.
The center beam is held by two feet, unfortunately, these are defectively produced.
The center bar does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I will get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent off?
No flat ones.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the correct ones in terms of shape; they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose
At my place, they are not flat
Could I have this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and extensive damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
Additionally, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has occurred, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The criminal investigation department of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.

And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To debunk fake news - BioNTech CEO releases vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn."
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not yet commented publicly on his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur now published a photo showing his Covid vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him to do so, Şahin shared.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In social media, there were false information that I supposedly was not vaccinated.
Indeed, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
For several months now, friends have been pressing me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors.
So far, he has rejected that because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, Şahin continued to write.
He did not ask for the reasons.
The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Fear is difficult to combat with facts; sometimes, it's better to share personal experiences for that reason.
An interview is circulating on the internet with Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says that he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle also clarified.
"Currently, I am not legally allowed to receive the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization in the administration of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the BioNTech CEO has been vaccinated three times, according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had crippled a substation.
After a fire with severe damage at a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for about 24 hours.
Due to the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The utility company Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators were in operation on Saturday until the widespread disruption was finally completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and THW volunteers provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The utility company thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are quite aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology division, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will still take a few days because the Westnetz technicians were initially only able to temporarily put some lines back into operation, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company information.
Electricity is flowing again
The fire that broke out around 7:15 p.m. on Friday has, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid transformer station.
There, extensive cleaning and repair work would be necessary.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again.
Additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected starting at 9:30 PM.
Since 11:15 PM, even those last affected by the outage have had power.
Over 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
After setting up emergency power supplies for key buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighborhood assistance.
"It is now important that the citizens take care of the elderly or individuals living alone in their neighborhood and inform the local fire stations if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) following a crisis meeting.
In setting up and operating emergency power units, the focus was primarily on the residents of nursing homes.
Additionally, according to the authorities, temporary care facilities have been set up in schools for those people who were unable to take care of themselves or who needed electrically powered medical devices or were dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy that from you and pay in Euros?
It is the daybed cover #PRS_ORG# in teal.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the subframe on the tabletop.
It is about custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of that.
We wanted those with tabletop diameters of #NUMBER#
We got a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't slide these into each other and thus shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back because otherwise they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that is really easier!
Then let's do it this way!
Could you send me the return form via email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic Combined: Combined athlete Riiber wins
German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Once again, the duo had to admit defeat to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a large lead after ski jumping.
Return of Order Number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both redid it and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard about problems several times.
I directly bought a book with my #PRS_ORG#; it also seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it, the message appears, oops!
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
Chat connection is lost, now what?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure an even and clean application of paint, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry off.
Before you touch the model with the brush loaded with a new color for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Slight overlapping of the color layers ensures an even surface later on.
Avoid fast back and forth swiping with the brush.
This results in surfaces that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones might show through later otherwise.
Metallic tones and metallic colors are added right at the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal streaks when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them.
The models achieve a faithful appearance through the decals or stickers.
From sovereign marks on airplanes to ship names to decorative trims and badges on car models: The decals provide the final touch to the model.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible.
An airplane cockpit can be stickered or more easily stickered before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks are time, patience, and a steady hand when applying stickers.
Cut each needed decal out separately and lay them out for yourself.
Decals are also called water slide decals because you moisten the back of them briefly with water until the backing paper turns dark due to the moisture.
Then you simply slide the decal a little bit from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away to the side.
Caution: Always check first if the image is positioned correctly before sliding it completely off the paper, to prevent it from sticking to your finger, wrinkling, or even tearing.
Absorb excess water with a paper towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only briefly open a book; as soon as I look at something else, I can no longer read the book and have to log off and on again, reload the book, and find the place up to where I have read.
On Saturday, I already communicated with you once before.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp did indeed arrive in 3 separate packages at my place
Okay, thank you very much anyway!
then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Can I get that back without any problems?
Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We have been in fertility treatment for some time; now, when it comes to settling the bill with the private health insurance, they are suddenly being difficult.
In sequence:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and received approval for 3 attempts.
The attempts were not limited in any way (e.g., timeframe, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and childbirth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and went through 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we did not yet settle these with the private health insurance.
We once again applied for cost coverage at the private health insurance and were once again granted 3 additional attempts.
After several more attempts (we conducted more attempts than promised, logically billing the most expensive ones with the private health insurance) we submitted the invoices to the private health insurance and got a nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire for a child is considered a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment and ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in the panel here:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts will be reimbursed) or us (5 attempts should be reimbursed)?
Should the private health insurance have pointed out to us in the commitments that further attempts would expire with the birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you in advance for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach you again?
Okay.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you have obviously lost a good customer.
Feel free to pass that on to your manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund was initiated, and now you're telling me that I need to send the item back first.
I certainly can't help it that the dresser arrives completely distressed at my place.
Please look at the screenshot to see what the colleague has written.
It clearly states that the refund has been initiated and I still have not received any refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various pieces of furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't be doing that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
A office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they may not sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools that can be purchased, but unfortunately, we cannot find them at your store.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition with exact budget limits for what exactly a low-budget film is.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what do you perhaps not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, having already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is it now reliable as well?
Thank you very much
Kind regards
If there's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes isn't a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes with the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Pyrrhic victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "partial victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
The costs are very high, though, and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Protestant News Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation sustainably, explained the researcher of the Berlin-based German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).
This state of suspension - Belarus doesn't completely back down, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while longer.
The handling of the people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, judged Bossong.
There seems to be an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole does not resolutely oppose it, it comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development simultaneously weakens the cohesion within the Union.
"She apparently cannot assert herself when a member state is determined to do its own thing", as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU pays another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A fundamental agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult because the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been reinforced.
Renewed attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland's Border Guard, migrants have once again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested overnight into Sunday and taken back to the border, a spokesperson for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were reportedly pelted with stones by the migrants near the village of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated medically by a military doctor.
Overall, the border patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as the ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Additionally, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response has been the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
Here, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough measures and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also consider domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is alleged to have committed two breaches of the rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations at the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is related to an alleged infraction by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety Car phase, when he is supposed to have overtaken against the rules.
A second objection was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in compliance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car period, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I will check that.
I will speak with the bank and get back to you again.
Thank you for the support
Free Admission for Members: Europa-Park to Host SC Freiburg Fan Day
The Europa-Park, the namesake for the Europa-Park Stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As reported by the park, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were also vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster trains glowed red and white that day through the jerseys.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus, and many red-and-white balloons created the perfect backdrop," said the park.
Since the beginning of the 90s, there has been a cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park, it was once again evident how well the partnership fits.
"To see beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is it €#NUMBER# and not originally €1699?
Stages in the career of the new World Champion Verstappen
Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new Formula 1 World Champion.
Max Verstappen has done it.
The Dutchman secures his first World Championship title in Formula 1 in his seventh year with Red Bull.
His path to the pinnacle of the premier class:
Abu Dhabi - 2012, Italy: Verstappen loses the Kart World Championship after a crash in Sarno.
Father Jos Verstappen leaves him angry at a gas station on the way back.
His mother Sophie Kumpen picks up the teenager in the car following behind.
2014, England: The junior team of Red Bull gets a promising newcomer in Verstappen.
The 16-year-old thus follows in the footsteps of Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo.
At that time, he initially continues in the European Formula 3.
2015, Australia: At the age of 17 years and 166 days, Verstappen starts as the youngest driver in history in a Grand Prix.
Due to a defect, he has to retire his Toro Rosso early in Melbourne.
2015, Malaysia: The then Toro Rosso driver Verstappen is also the youngest racing driver to score points in Formula 1 at 17 years and 180 days old.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord," author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday, and also acted as the moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast, and sensitively listens to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form to return an item yesterday, but I have not received an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and cheap goods delivered incorrectly from China.
Your mistake that you need to fix, and not everyone from our household.
Please contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order for the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
I want to bring the package to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
Kind regards

Sorry, but just because he says he is not an antisemitic means nothing.
It's like when a member of the AfD says they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither will admit it.
But Kollegah continuously reproduces various antisemitic messages.
If one wants to distance oneself, then one should simply leave it altogether.
Yes, wow, then you're about as unserious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the fundamentals of evolution is simply completely lost.
For my sake, a god set the whole thing in motion.
But once you're a creationist you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science just spouts nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows for virtually distortion-free and chromatic aberration-free use of the magnifying glass right to the edge zone.
Frequently, magnifying glasses are marked with magnification specifications.
These specifications apply only to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To optimize your use of the magnifying glass, we ask that you observe the instructions in the "Technical Specifications" table (see the instruction manual in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including jewelers' loupes - light reflections occur.
The reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
When adhering to the optimal conditions of use - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instruction manual (available in German and English).

Christmas Tree Sale in Schönwolde: In the Krembz community, women select the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced quite a few curious situations when selling fir trees.
One time, a man is said to have even driven home without his partner because they could not come to an agreement.
Every year he plants a good 2000 for that purpose.
In the process, the 56-year-old has already experienced quite a few curious situations.
It always makes the pre-Christmas period a bit fun, he says.
And what about the voucher??
Otherwise, I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I have received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And therefore both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with Fiber Optic + Devolo dLAN/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems establishing a stable Wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which, except for a few dropouts, received and transmitted a flawless 50 Mbit.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590, and at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these are also received.
However, at the other DLAN module, which emits the WiFi, the full 500 no longer arrive, but the further I move away in the house with the module, the less is received (meaning if I use an outlet that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This results in the internet being slower now on the first floor with the new fiber optic connection than before (~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was somewhat better than the DLan, but there were also similarly large losses here.
Can someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optic?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely elaborate to run LAN cables in the house now.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here specifically.
Therefore, I would be all the more pleased to receive a response.
When it's time to switch current accounts
Anyone who thought that there would be a break with checking accounts now is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to get their customers to confirm past fee increases with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to decrease.
For instance, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time.
Now she has just halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for the overnight deposit.
In a first step, the threshold was lowered only for customers of the group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for overnight money accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements made with existing customers."
Commerzbank had previously reduced the limit to 50,000 euros, which is still in place, as is the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which even won in the first instance against this regulation at the Regional Court of Berlin.
Now there is already discussion in the banks about whether the institutions should perhaps form provisions - in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally inadmissible and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army.
She now officially stands at the top of Hollywood.
Yet their life is like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who caused a sensation in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
After all, Aniston allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
It's actually a miracle that she wins over the hearts of female and male fans alike.
Perhaps because she's just unlucky with luck - and still looking for true love.
And has crossed off the desire for a baby from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame also bring happiness.
Indignified end to a career: Räikkönen must retire
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
Due to a driving error and a light contact with the barrier, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the premier class of motorsport.
For the farewell, his wife Minttu and their two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest achievement was winning the 2007 World Championship with Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position, and made it to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich clinches 60th World Cup victory - Nolte triumphs in two-man bobsleigh - Sports
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's record of 94 victories is the target for the bobsleigh pilot.
"I've done the math, I would need to earn nine and a half wins per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, on Saturday, he fended off the attack from Johannes Lochner by five-hundredths of a second, moving up from third to first place.
Then he made a change to the material setting and on Sunday increased his lead by 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed against the Briton Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian, Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also secured his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgaden native Johannes Lochner, who was heading for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after previously securing second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, then I would do it the same way," Lochner said.
Nolte with a home victory - Podium for Jamanka
In the women's event, Laura Nolte secured her third seasonal win in the two-woman bobsleigh at her home track.
After only managing a fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to a World Cup victory on Sunday during the German triple success with brakewoman Deborah Levi.
Two-woman bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia, together with Germany's fastest sprinter Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, ranked second.
She recorded her first podium finish this winter alongside her Olympic qualification.
The Wiesbaden native Kim Kalicki, together with Leonie Fiebig, finished in third place.
For me, it was super cool, first podium in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me along.
I'm super happy with the progress.
There's still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, emphasizing, "It's not just about pushing off, there's also an enormous amount to do around that."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely flawless trips, but said, "It's heading in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had expired which made me very angry.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it is currently on sale :)
Why is shipping starting only on the 16th of March?
There was no mention of such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it, an extra field with the message pops up.
Was taken over by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we would like the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged one.
And do not cancel the entire order.
Just this day left, just this week left, just until XY...
Hello dear amazing girls and girls and women,
I have a few things that I just want to write down and maybe there are others who feel the same way...
I am 24, have C-PTSD, a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's basically my child in every way.
My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to a burn).
Additionally, he has caught a cold and we currently see each other less frequently (1-2 times a week), which is really challenging for me with my need for affection and love.
My fur baby just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cuddle blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and some petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month right now.
Now we also have housework coming our way, which we will naturally divide.
But cooking myself is just a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD condition is currently well-managed, I am reasonably well-treated and coping.
Not good, but I'm getting by and am almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (from me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and the day after tomorrow an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no room left there.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing continues, right?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the vacation.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental cues because otherwise I just can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I do not have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I just can't put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my tough times without it.
I believe that this also has a lot to do with mental load on women, and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening in any case; the week is almost over!
Today I received my order, unfortunately it is a completely different color plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
In the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we swap the table now, will I get another color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, twice.
However, she was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I realized back in school that many religious studies teachers do not believe in God and for them, it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me, that was always somewhat strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always kind of believed.
What's your opinion on that?
Perhaps you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Fundamentally, I understand the difference between private and professional life, and it makes sense to separate them.
There's also a curriculum and stuff.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What then motivates one to want to teach religion if one does not believe in it?
Preserving culture or something like that?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can it be changed or not? I also understand English well, so feel free to write in that.
That's been a very long time, then I would refrain from it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect feedback promptly, by early next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie search help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway, there is a young woman in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he himself can live, I mean.
I believe the transition is also the grave of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that means anything to you, I am grateful for any response.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything around is right, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often, but no minute-to-minute monitoring.
That drives you insane!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours never had a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten up a bit from its stomach?
Or is it lying face down directly in the mattress?
From that, you can deduce whether everything is alright.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, for example, it was common to lay the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Moreover, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already purchased a lot of items.
But then why are you offering me only 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received any response so far.
It's about my wardrobe which arrived the day before yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The closet is currently not usable.
To put it quite plainly.
RBTV has made many promises.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
But the thing is, the politics of this station have now become utterly terrible.
Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but at the same time to go on a big begging tour.
It has been said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: One does not want to be "a walking advertising column".
What is one now?
A run-of-the-mill advertising broadcaster trying to peddle their cheap merch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
The rules naturally apply to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they are still allowed to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make money at the expense of the action with the rented rooms that exploded.
How is one supposed to like all this?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I am requesting a callback as my delivered wooden table was delivered damaged.

Whether as a comforter for stomach aches or just for cuddling - My little heat buddy is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in controlled doses.
The removable inner cushion can be easily warmed up in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly comfortable, ensuring that the little ones feel secure, even when they are not feeling so well.
The cherry stone pillow with cover is exclusively suitable as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before warming the pillow, check for atypical odors, mold, or scorch marks and dispose of it immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before warming it up!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (observe the microwave manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the initial warmings, slight moisture formation may occur on the surface, which however disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the warming instructions provided, as longer times or higher energy levels can lead to damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check if heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After placing the warmed inner cushion back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion at the crook of your arm to ensure it's suitable for babies (max. 43 °C)!
Do not use the pillow in case of acute and chronic inflammatory or febrile conditions, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, bruises, and open wounds, as well as in individuals with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, cardiac, vein, diabetes or cancer conditions, as well as during pregnancy, please consult a doctor before using.
If seams have come apart and loose filling is coming out, dispose of the product and the loose filling immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the child's temperature should be monitored regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30°C.
Please pay attention to the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt in second place after the first half of the season - St. Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga (German Football League).
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working their way up from the bottom of the table.
For Ingolstadt, things are not going well under the third coach either.
Celebrations in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ, approximately 3 years old) was no longer charging through my power adapter.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone would also suffice for operation.
Malfunction, the battery is dead and the laptop won't start even with the power adapter plugged in.
As a result, I removed the battery, but still nothing happens.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop when it's plugged in?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# into the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat surface is, though.....
Often on tour and still have a lot of equipment with you?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
The 20-liter capacity can swallow even larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need in everyday items remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series now also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design is quite literally packed with features - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still allowing lightning-fast access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: conventionally through the lid flap, which can be secured with the MagLatch closure system, a superbly considered solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
The closure flap features a metal locking hook with corresponding anchor bars on the front side of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are, in fact, 4 anchor bars, solidly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar, if it's emptier, take one lower.
Flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without the hook engaging.
The second feature also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
That eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: especially if you're not just carrying your camera equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior space to your own configuration (more on that below) and thus neatly store both separately and independently access them through the two side openings.
Additionally, you can pull the backpack around to the front from the right side to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, for instance, while everyday items remain securely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents stay dry even when you're planning to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I have been waiting in vain for the email from your support.

The forwarding company has announced contact regarding the collection of the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any message.
I request immediate processing.
I am now already writing with the third support staff member, with none of them did I get further than the promise that I would receive an email confirmation.
This concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#

Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment were on 1/12/21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than the one I ordered.
Please call me
If you extend the voucher for me, then I will place a larger order right away, but after all, I kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
And I could not have foreseen that the past year would turn out differently than expected and as a result, I was unable to resolve and clarify it in a timely manner.
But as a customer, I am the one who suffers the damage and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver who appreciates reliability and safety in braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made from cast iron and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tuned panes are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are inherent to certain panes and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created that focuses on balancing the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The disks tuned in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disk, while the chamfers improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned windows emphasize the character of each car with their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shiny chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and turned Coloma into one of the fastest-growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas had been marked out, tents had been pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for oneself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, roundup horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, must manage your resources carefully, and build a tableau that increasingly "works" for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or bend the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style through fine adjustments.
Coloma spans over a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their choice is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving carts, pitching tents, scouring rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
Once all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The crier turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, thereby changing the available actions.
This continues until the barker has moved five times, thus having covered each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout where the players must defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!
With free shipping, I'll use the shipping method "merchandise mail" for items up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm (games shrink-wrapped).
In all other cases, mostly DPD insured and with shipment tracking (games wrapped in foil, surrounded with fleece, and packing paper).
If you are a collector, then for an additional charge of 2 euros, I can also ship the item in a box within a box to ensure that there are absolutely no pressure marks.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Media Library
Trigger warning: psychological abuse, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary popped up in my Twitter timeline today, and I immediately watched it.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and gives lectures all over Europe.
With his book "Why our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce debate on parenting.
Former patients and legal guardians are now raising serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
As parents and other responsible parties, it should never, ever, ever be about having power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: States discuss dropping the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals
The health ministers of the federal states plan to decide on a nationwide elimination of the testing requirement for those who have received three vaccinations at their next meeting.
"We states need quick clarity on whether and from when the testing obligation can be dropped for those vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag."
The elimination of 2G plus for those who are triple-vaccinated is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the conference of health ministers on this as early as next Tuesday." - afp
So I want to return the lamp
What is the best way to proceed?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, however, I cannot see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer conduct a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer works.
I have updated the account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is referred to as *awareness*, which means sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this results in the hearing of noises/voices, less often in the seeing of images, and the rarest of all in the perception of pain.
Relevant to this topic: Cesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids very deep anesthesia until the umbilical cord is cut to protect the child.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia pre-discussion.
Certain anesthesia techniques such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment of mine accurately describes awareness, however,** u/Nitemarex **by definition had none.**
Misread their comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the €20 won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
This is, in addition to the legal obligation, also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
There we also lose quite a bit of money.
I already sent you an email, which you have not answered.
Once again the question.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was informed that they only deliver to the front door because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I will have to cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor for me.
Am I not being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97
He has made a name for himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97.
There, the new book is still on the table, fresh from the press: "An Old Man Grows Older".
The harrowing diary of a slow farewell to the world that the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "Here I already testify my gratitude for life".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are used mainly in Europe as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
In 2020, according to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was just over 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported to Austria annually is not collected.
New York wins MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular playing time against hosts Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I received many great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery tender!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I've acquired a taste for it and would like to cook roulades for the first time for New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow, I will start making a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What happens next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not that good anymore, but I can manage it.
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund was processed.
However, until today the money has not been received by me.
Could you please check there.
Where you can still get Christmas roast in Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and the presents.
You haven't gotten any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amp contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust both the desired level and the amount of distortion in your sounds.
Moreover, the amplifiers from the VT+ series feature a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything about the "Gain" and distortion.
It was already suggested earlier that with the POWER LEVEL control, a performance reserve can be quickly activated if things become outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controls, the full potential of the VT+ Series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line-out.
The signal present here is processed with a cabinet simulation, so that you get a highly "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or with direct recordings.
An AUX jack can be used to connect a CD or MP3 player so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuning device.
Anyone who treats themselves to an additional VFS5 footswitch can also conveniently call up the sounds with their foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and tap the tempo for the compatible effects accordingly.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX takes another step into the future!
I had seen it like that with others, though.
Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low over a dining table?
So I would then like to send them back.
Can you help me with this?
And the dresser?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it's not possible, I would also be happy with a discount or a voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need is a bit too much after all.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were supposed to be part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you guys?
Iran sees progress in negotiations over nuclear deal
In the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement, progress is emerging according to Iranian reports.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," because initially there wasn't even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks aimed at reviving the agreement had resumed after a nearly week-long interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
Also, a US delegation is on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now the federal state with the highest Corona incidence rate
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had a COVID-19 incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day figure at 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which recently always had the highest incidence rate nationwide, this value was at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, within one day, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths associated with an infection were reported.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were treated in intensive care units in hospitals on Sunday.
At weekends there may be delays in reporting.
Moreover, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and can hardly keep up with recording new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is not due until early March, it may be possible by then.
I need to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
Here I don't have to click/enter/fill in anything else?
Exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I am writing to you.
I would like to please handle the return shipping at my own expense.
An 8 euro return fee is, in my eyes, an impudence.
It's time for changes
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
### English:What's the purpose of this post here?
If one takes a look at the activity in the Bundestag over the past few months, one thing can be determined: It is nonexistent.
We have fallen into a winter hibernation and have extended the summer slump over several months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason for it?
To a large extent, this is probably due to the dissatisfaction with how some things have gone here and our general standing.
Over the last few days, the impression has increasingly emerged that many people here are really still keen on the MBundestag.
### What we need to change
At this point, the community surrounding the MBundestag, which wants to keep it alive, is called upon.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and, simply put, found a mess.
After some back and forth messaging, several people from the community have been found who are eager to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, as this is the only way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas and work out specific things.
You can join the server using this link.
Goals:
How should the Federal Diet function in the future?
Which existing arrangements need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
How should we present ourselves externally in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I am quite sure that I have forgotten a few things, but that's not a problem; that's what we have Discord for in the end.
If you feel like it and have the time, come to Discord, join in and let's decide on the future democratically.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clunky for that and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you for this.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope that this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in an oversized version, for example, in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must surely be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I don't have suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for the pickup - you will have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work out.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to schedule a pickup appointment.
Is there a manual for assembly?
How long would I have to procure these or decide on the return?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like a lot.
She herself lived as a vegetarian for a while and currently also eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for several years as well.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I honestly answered without giving it much thought.
Indeed, I long thought that I was supporting animal welfare by being a vegetarian, but at some point, I reflected on it and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I got the impression that discontent was arising on her part; she then defended vegetarianism, saying that she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "clumsy"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly pigeonholed and conflicts arise without you instigating them.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the statutory requirements for distance selling.
I will not be on site on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I cannot be present due to a funeral, unfortunately, that cannot be changed.
Can an alternative pick-up date be assigned to me, please.
From February 1st, #NUMBER#, I will be consistently available again.
Lahnsteiner weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant notice for 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment cart is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a permanent expectation of increasing deployments: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the continuing increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I was only able to read 10% of, and then the problems started.
I cannot open the book.
I followed their recommendations but have synchronized, removed, and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Okay, that's how it is then.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date during the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for facing this whole matter here, I too spent almost a decade in public service in a similar activity, that is, we were also bearers of arms in the executive, I do not want to elaborate on that!
I always find the question about right-wing and left-wing very overly simplified.
Fundamentally, however, one should say that naturally the civil servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, this should actually be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that, naturally, uniforms and weapon bearers also have a magnetic attraction for people on the right of conservative. And it should also be clear that these people then naturally have a hard time dealing with lived reality because, besides the average white person, you now have many Germans with an immigrant background, women, and also homosexuals (and by that, I don't mean the excessively feminine stereotypical gay man, because they are rather rare or non-existent in the executive forces, but rather completely normal men and women who you wouldn't notice unless they tell you) and I must and can rely on these people, because in doubt they might save your life or risk theirs for you.
But even these fringe groups, even if it may sound strange at first, in my experience, hold conservative views; that is, they are proud of Germany and feel that they are not well-represented by excessive left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly advocates for them or thinks it has to please them. In reality, they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the issue of rights, since the police and armed forces also represent a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right-wingers there. However, the idea that they are allowed to openly express their views there, or even openly concoct any plans endangering the state, is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that precisely police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad start to generalize based on negative experiences and occasionally say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing like-minded individuals meet who engage in lively exchanges of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such things are well combated and counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined, and in my opinion, that's a good thing, that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I placed my order, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your order confirmation
It's still about my order, which is no longer available for delivery.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket in black be delivered to Germany for #NUMBER# euros, or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany?
I always only find you as a partner company.
but at the top edge of the wooden part are two deep notches that have been filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself there is a small scratch
Properly through child?
Hello, something has been on my mind for a long time now (f32).
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life, I have managed to keep my household clean and tidy more poorly than well.
There are always phases in which everything is left lying around, and now and then I get the urge and I tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never the case that someone might come over spontaneously.
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhat but most of the time household chores simply lose out to work and reluctance.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we like to cook.
Now onto my question, have you managed to become more organized with a child?
We don't have one yet but are working on it, and this question has preoccupied me for quite some time.
Because for me, I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me that much, as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
With a child, do you have a greater motivation or do you remain sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically pre-shaped cut offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, extended embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)
The area covered by the Flex System on the Focea Comfort 4 has been more than doubled with the Flex System 2 to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (underarms, elbow and knee bends)
High-quality pre-forms in the lower back area and in the crotch ensure a close-fitting, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper, thereby improving comfort, especially when bending over and when mounting and donning equipment at the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility for movements of the arms and the back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal around the face on the hood increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate head hood)

Career in social work - as someone with an avoidant personality disorder?
I have completed a training in the field of software development and have now been qualified for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering for some time to start over and study social work.
The problem: I have an avoidant personality disorder, also known as anxious (or fearfully avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to engage in casual conversations and I've been told several times that I seem unapproachable (although I believe that has improved).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather, for example, in addiction counseling or family support.
I don't know if the actual day-to-day work is really like I imagine it, and it's hard to find anything about it on the internet.
The AFPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("messed up the simplest things again") and I find it hard to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I really should know by now how this works"/"I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm incompetent" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it at this point.
You have already gotten the sofa back, haven't you?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup.
What do they mean by return, please!
If I have downloaded a book onto the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message that your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book.
Are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein ingested with the food is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein components (amino acids), and from these, it synthesizes its own bodily proteins, which are also needed for feather formation.
The plumage development in nestlings and the plumage renewal in molting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with particularly high demands on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding as it can lead to disturbances in the breeding process.
After this course-like administration of NEKTON-Bio, one should return to the daily vitamin care with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).
The protein ingested with the food is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein components (amino acids), and from these, it reconstructs its own body proteins, which are also needed for feather formation.
The plumage development in the nestling and the plumage renewal in the molting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain for the animal's entire organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding as it can otherwise lead to disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this course of treatment with NEKTON-Bio, one should return to the daily vitamin regimen with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).
1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is advisable to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One leveled measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
With severe feather damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the start of new feather growth is visible.
Thereafter, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is fully complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without exposure to sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a municipal employee in contradiction to the bylaws
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree is set to be cut down.
Applied for a tree felling permit to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also of the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, the charter specifically lists the walnut as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
I thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Well, then I still have a sofa with no use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What were more expensive then?
Yes, I believe so, just the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to me in Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Major traffic accident near Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord interchange and Ploessberg.
As the police press alert currently reports (2:03 PM), a car came into oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Ah okay, I understand.
Alright, then thank you once again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderate because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I start rambling on... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the refs as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a related field (to remain at least a little anonymous, I will not specify anything further).
The whole thing was too boring for me after a while, so I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
Eventually, I ended up in teaching and I was sure that was it - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now reached the third "I'm googling other job listings" stage.
And only half a year has passed.
In the times before, I always decided to keep going and at least finish the rough draft. After that, I can still change course.
But right now I am absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's vacation time, but there's still a pile of work waiting for me.
Before I became a referee, I always thought I was resistant to stress, but back then my weekends were my own, and my free time in the evening was my own.
I had the day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Fundamentally, it's enjoyable and from the outside looking in, the refereeing is also going well, as far as feedback and the like are concerned.
But I am completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can handle before it completely shuts down - if it isn't doing that already.
I wonder if I want to have it like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old field where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and although I found the work somewhat boring, I was paid appropriately and worked together with a team instead of being a lone fighter as is mostly the case now.
But then I wonder if in a year's time I won't find myself back in the same place as now, unsatisfied.
You notice, everything is somehow confused, but maybe as outsiders you have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, where I am completely exhausted and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I won't be making decisions emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse my whiny undertone.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been continuously evolving, which, among other things, has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers boast an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps, of course, also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they achieve the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier simply better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances simply bubble forth.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound just the way you've always imagined them.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet the newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 led to another boost in performance of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and a greater number of significantly improved amplifier models.
From the portable VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they need here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that it is primarily the power stage that determines the tube character of an amplifier and, based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuitry, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, in each VT+ amplifier perfectly replicates the behavior, the subtle nuances, and the tone character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 Points from Wagner: Magic Lose to Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - however, it's not enough for a victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it can be tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLR cameras.
Ultimately, what fits into the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and an external flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
Additionally, one can also store a lot of accessories.
And anyone who owns a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers ample space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the just under three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows have caused significant damage on the Canary Island.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the recorded history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in the year 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, lasting 84 days.
No reliable data are available on earlier outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat over the past few days, but volcanologists still did not dare to predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damages amounting to millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava, which is more than 1000 degrees hot, has destroyed almost 2900 residential buildings and other structures, as reported by RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That corresponds to almost 1700 soccer fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million Euros.
Off the coast, two new headlands were formed by cooled lava, with a combined size of about 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit, already being in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, additional areas were heavily damaged, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful presents under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still unite our increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss had been a peace-making "social contract among primitive peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be reinvigorated within the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus Became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants by whom the Christmas holidays were closely linked with the giving of presents.
Previously, gifts were exchanged in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this custom, still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as the bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women in one night, to save them from a further life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular German custom of filling especially children's boots with gifts emerged.
Protestants took offense to this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and people as "saint veneration."
For these reasons, they object to the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
As most Protestants no longer view such detailed questions so strictly, it only annoys a few that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the tradition of Martin singing and Martin's parade, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires in boots by the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources document a tradition of giving gifts since the 13th century on Saint Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving gifts shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, however, there is a cheerful confusion over the question of who exactly brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is essentially a type of Saint Nicholas to whom several peculiarities have been ascribed over time, depends on the particular region.
Included in this, for example, are his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the rather stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost has achieved some fame.
Here it is not reindeer but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.
For 3 weeks now, when trying to download a new book, I have been receiving this error message, but my account information and contact details are up to date:
Please ask for help with troubleshooting since I
otherwise buy another e-book from #PRS_ORG#.
I applied for a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.
I was told that one will be sent to me.
Since I have not received one yet (not in the SPAM folder either), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the royal palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who is said to have entered a bank and the premises of a bookmaker with a weapon.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by officers a short time later.
Shots had been fired and the man had been hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist background.
In the area around Kensington Palace, several embassies are located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
which one then?
No matter where I click, I am immediately redirected to your page.
The decorative light blends in harmoniously with any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The light fixture is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Illumination duration max. 10 hrs.
The robust plastic design is suitable for year-round use outdoors.
In the Hollywood spectacle, they are mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully from within.
Quite harmless, on the other hand, is "Smart Stone": the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The edgeless, amorphous design is a deliberate choice: Like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern lighting object presents itself during the day.
His organic curves fit into any natural setting - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the proximity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he is able to hold his own thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preliminary work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither a power line nor batteries.
Place the "glow stone" at any spot that is exposed to sunlight during the day.
Two included ground spikes ensure a firm hold when needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly conceals the "Smart Stone" within, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the casing.
As twilight sets in, "Smart Stone" begins to light up automatically; the color in which it shines is up to you: In addition to daylight white, you have a choice of six attractive light colors.
The system will also eventually turn off automatically once the battery charge level drops to a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from the beginning on the next day.
I have already done this several times; it doesn't work.
It's a shame, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if my voucher is not applied, then on principle, I will not order anymore.
If you change your mind, then let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
During the lockdown, no hardware store is open anyway.....

Pills problem
Hello dear womenfolk,
I hope I'm doing everything right, after a year on Reddit this is actually my first post.
Regarding my problem: About five years ago, I was forced to start taking the pill again, primarily because I had such incredibly severe pain during my period and shitty PMS before my period.
Now, I would like to stop doing that again, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic diseases, which I cannot choose for myself.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last break of about two years, I suddenly got pimples from zero to one hundred and they were everywhere.
So far, so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, things never really returned to normal.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this this time.
Fragrance-free and without any fuss, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me very seriously, and the dermatologist appointment is yet to come.
Thank you so much to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is quite a thing.
Prepubescent severe atopic dermatitis, then a period of calm, then widespread lichen nodules and the acne issue.
Regarding nutrition, I have tried all sorts of things due to chronic illness and have settled on a diet low in sugar, milk, and meat, because nothing else really worked well.
It's also possible that there's just a hormonal imbalance, but when you're like me and have issues everywhere, you just don't feel like looking for what else might be going wrong.
I had already explained everything to her colleague semina or the like.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was replied to my concern.
I always have to work in between and answer the phone and then suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check, if the money were there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, perhaps there was something wrong.
but is it generally available in large sizes
since it is available in large size and black

In the name of the people: Laypeople make judgments
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judges' bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear a robe: Lay judges, together with professional judges, determine whether and for how long someone is imprisoned.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Öffentlichen" about their time at the Bad Kreuznach regional court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the regional court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I can't get into the customer account.
Could you please send the invoice from order number #NUMBER# once again to the above-mentioned email address?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no means of keeping these for so long.
We would use the table as if it were our own, as offered by them.
Sure, I had already ordered the same chair in blue back in November and received it. Because they are so beautiful, I would now like one in grey.
Does the cabinet have to be completely disassembled for the pickup and refund?
and when would the pickup be?
The 110-kV underground cable is being newly constructed in 2022.
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision of the Lower Bavaria government clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now announced this.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality with the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good Morning,
My order from 01/03/21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts.
The blue order number #PRS_ORG# with the tracking number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are now?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget about that, I've explained it several times already yesterday!!
This is a dresser made of glass and all the sides have burst open, thus there's glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to the #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the dresser cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's with all the books, which is why I'm inquiring at #PRS_ORG#, as it appears to be a general issue.
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the trainee program since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I am currently still having major problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped at all, so in principle, I can only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector (OHP) as a medium.
In school, I can also only photocopy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
Currently, I just need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently covering the topic of geofactors, and for me, each lesson essentially stands on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest an excessive amount of time for simple lessons (which I also need for teaching units, etc.).
When planning, I usually always start with the learning objective (what do I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build on that (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am quite dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Therefore the worksheets as well.
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
The trade fears for the Christmas business due to the 2G regulation.
Entry to most stores is permitted only for those who are vaccinated or recovered.
The trade considers it unnecessary and laments the decline in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations, according to the German Retail Federation (HDE), are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
In businesses dealing with non-daily necessities, there have been complaints of a drop in sales, criticized HDE managing director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative outlook for the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Merchants with 2G access restrictions thus lost just under a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Business is only going well in the retail food industry and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance, and a hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G while shopping does not advance us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high staff involvement.
The ribbon system should be permitted nationwide, he demanded.
Subsequently, each customer would have to be checked only once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and, with the obtained wristband, would have access to all stores on that day.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transportation with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested) - spot checks should suffice.
The retail property group Deutsche Euroshop also reported a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, with revenues at about 90 percent.
"These figures will surely drop now in the midst of the all-important Christmas business," CEO Wilhelm Wellner told "WirtschaftsWoche."
Due to the high personnel and administrative efforts, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, where "visitors, for example, provide their proof of 2G at a central location in the center once and then, equipped with a wristband similar to those used in a club hotel, can enter all the stores without being disturbed." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there's also a defect on the frame, which someone attempted to conceal with a yellow filler.
That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged it and sealed the package.
What do I need to do next for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high output and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range from 3100 to 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance, is outstanding.
By the way also in reporter situations in small spaces or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work with both on the film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller enables the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and an illuminated display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery)
User memory The memory can store up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and you're done.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with a battery, one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality comes from the ability to operate it with affordable NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments a reading in the two display indicators (the left battery in the upper display, the right one in the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously power the headlight via the supplied power adapter.
The structure of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for mounting, so you can attach it directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted using locking devices on both sides.
Care has been taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and hard use.
Additionally, an incline joint is included in the scope of delivery.
Great that a bag is included in the scope of delivery.
Thus, you can transport or store the light fixture with all the accessories you may still want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party, we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
Twenty-two minutes in, the Hessian team, which had failed to secure a victory in their last two consecutive matches, seemingly found themselves on the path to another Bundesliga defeat.
But then Eintracht Frankfurt turned up the heat, venting their frustration over a mixed season start within a good hour and secured a furious 5:2 victory. "It's insane what the boys have accomplished today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN, extending "blanket praise to everyone who was involved."
At first it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, which was still ranked ninth and continued to fall short of their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put the Leverkuseners ahead 2-0.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players came back and put on a fantastic performance," continued Glasner.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to take the field for the first time since the fourth matchday and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, and with a glance at the result, he was especially happy for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to maintain focus on himself, but also sees himself well-positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It is exceptional that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one wants to "proceed step by step and remain modest" and to "see through the tasks at this level until the turn of the year."
Next up on Wednesday as part of the English week is an away game against Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 p.m., Sky).
I just received the email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# to have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly back to me or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and then place the order again?
Unfortunately, this would mean that I won't be ordering again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for women's handball before quarterfinal against Spain
Germany's handball women slunk off the court with heads hanging and vacant stares after the humiliation against Denmark.
At the end of the World Championship main round, the DHB team suffered a severe defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face the host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were far too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we must approach the game differently.
After the first loss in the tournament, Germany finished second in the main round group III with 8:2 points, behind the Danish women (10:0).
It's a pity that we couldn't keep the flow going.
"That was a bad game from everyone, which we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement is necessary against the 2019 World Cup runners-up next Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was the backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the offense nor in the defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits, demanding: "We now have to quickly look forward."
Out of sorts from head to toe
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the top of their game from the kickoff.
Missed shots and technical mistakes in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a fast break.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly showcase themselves - and when they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in goal for the Scandinavians.
Thus, the match was effectively over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke was also shown a red card shortly afterwards for a harsh foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the closing phase of the first half did the DHB team start to play better and managed to come within at least five goals by the break.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the break had already vanished seven minutes into the second half with the score at 9:19.
Again, the Groener proteges sinned in all areas, making it easy for the well-prepared opponent who is one of the medal contenders in the final round.
As a result, the German team could not muster any improvement in performance and left the court as clear losers.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Season
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we snagged St. Nicholas' Day and we're taking this opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions during the pre-Christmas season, Advent, St. Nicholas' Day, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays.
What was it like back then at your home?
How about with your partner?
Do you also want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is most beautiful for the children?
Boot polishing?
Baking cookies?
Tree decorating?
Is music being played?
Does Santa Claus, the Christ Child, or is the present actually from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone tries hard to make it as nice as possible for the family around Christmas time.
Whether they are fixed traditions or even something different each year: tell us how it went or goes in your family!
Please send me any transaction number... or anything else that could help.
Transfer Confirmation... etc
I would like to give away a voucher code.
just like #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Is that possible for you?
The title suggests it, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is primarily administered in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely completed, I will then partly continue at vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit regarding organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personal (e.g., "I take medication X, does it interact with the vaccination?").
My responsibilities include providing information about vaccination, determining eligibility (person is entitled to vaccination according to the Covid vaccination regulation and there are no reasons to the contrary), medical documentation, and if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have any, but "only" (God forbid any lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who however cannot (are not allowed to?) administer vaccinations, so I mostly do the majority of vaccinations myself there.
Tricky "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the answer
What on earth is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, submitted by someone from Amberg, the "Wir in Bayern" TV show on BR has caused some intense pondering.
Yet unlike many previous days, this time the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous".
And also not someone who needs everything to happen quickly.
What the people heard from the TV presenter is completely wrong.
Upon which the man from Amberg conveyed the solution, thereby likely causing amazement among many Upper Palatinate residents.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the stove."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted for years as an expert by Bayerischer Rundfunk, confirmed that.
With the note that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the better-known dialect word "Houdern".
Which thereby closed an educational gap - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy any books for 2 weeks.
Following the confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have cleared the #PRS_ORG#, restarted it, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Tire choice for a racing bike - really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to do at least a little bit of training in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said and done, and off I went on my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really nice too - but then happened what lurks in just about every city center (this time: Thanks, Krefeld!).
Glass shards on the track.
Snap, loud hissing, and my rear tire absolutely refused to go along for the rest of the journey.
Since I had no real chance to get a spare coat and inner tube because of the weekday, I had to turn back with somewhat bad temper and take the first train home.
It wasn't that bad in terms of mood after all, maybe it's better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike tour.
Now, however, I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would extremely dislike having this problem multiple times.
Now it really wasn't bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who on the day I came to pick up the bike had ridden 120km by 2 pm!) were also included, and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had ridden on rollers with them for several years.
But when I think about having to change a tire after driving 80-90km, then I believe I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I have come into conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I don't really feel like spending 40€ per tire now, only to end up being disappointed.
Additionally, I wonder: at the moment on the racing bike I think I have 25x622.
They do exist (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tires to me for a road bike?
The Schwalbe site seems to recommend the Durano DD more to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for the help and best regards!
Car skids against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had collided with a central reservation on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for reasons that are still unclear and subsequently ended up on the opposite lane, as the police reported.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then hurled against a tree and the man was trapped inside the vehicle.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and were taken to nearby hospitals.
Yes, we did. We have deleted all books, re-authorized everything, and loaded new books.

Following the release of our new high-end full-range driver B 100 - 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would expand once again.
The new offspring is called SOLO 15 and visually resembles the great role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed base that is part of the package to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
Due to its principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people who consider maximum volume to be of lesser importance, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound quality.
A 10 cm speaker simply isn't capable of generating such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, that does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably adult and for her size extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble increase.
This is common practice with wideband systems to optimize the increasingly concentrated bundling at excessively high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and refined sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the treble range can be reduced, thus making the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a microdynamics that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 therefore not only complements our SOLO series but also extends it in terms of resolution and precision.
As with all of our kits, we recommend considering the final appearance of the speaker from the start, so as to plan for any modifications during the construction process.
If, for example, one wants to veneer the casing, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer adds more material.
After all the panels have been cut to size (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate spot so that the cable can later be passed through without any problems.
With the aid of a router, the speaker opening is now made in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be inserted flush.
The back side should be chamfered at 45 degrees to make the aperture area of the speaker driver inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM will receive a break in the bevel as shown in the "Detail Bevel" image.
Afterwards, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
Now the back panel, the lid, the front, and the base are glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued in place.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness as needed, if, for example, one wants to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them oneself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side will be attached.
After that, all the parts of the foot follow, that is, both sides as well as the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner bit makes it easier to install the openings for the bass reflex tube as well as the terminal cup on the back panel.
Subsequently, a round-over router bit is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with this.
Afterwards, the base plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
Next is the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill bit) of the screw mounting points of the speaker drivers and the terminal block.
After the casing has been cleaned of sawdust (vacuuming/blowing out), the laying of the cable begins.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear panel.
During this process, the entire and uncut cable is pushed through the 8 mm hole into the base bit by bit until the terminal opening and is left protruding there by about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is also left to hang out loosely there.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and installed.
The schematic of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection diagram, can be found in the following document: Assembly Instructions Crossover Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely sealed, follows.
Through the 35 mm BASS REFLEX port and with some skill, you can drip hot glue onto the opening to seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, one can accordingly inspect the seal.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM will be connected and fastened with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To provide damping, a mat made of damping material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed within the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello to everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we are hosting the OSCAST again this year!
For known reasons, unfortunately, we are unable to accommodate more than four people in the studio, which has resulted in a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people connected remotely, so that we will follow the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans on the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we will give it our all to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start at around 0:30.
Prepare some drinks to chill, plan for some good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
